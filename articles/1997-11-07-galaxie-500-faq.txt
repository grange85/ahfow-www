The Answers


PART I - The artists and the songs

    1  Galaxie 500 and related artists
        1.1  Galaxie 500
            Galaxie 500 were a magical three piece comprising of...
            Dean Wareham (guitar/vocals)
            Naomi Yang (bass/vocals)
            Damon Krukowski (drums)

            Seminal is a word often bandied about in describing certain
            influential groups and their works. And sadly, I must use the
            hackneyed word in an attempt to convey the underrated greatness
            that was Galaxie 500. Like the Velvet Underground before them,
            Galaxie 500 didn't have a large contemporary audience, but they
            had a profound effect on almost everyone who listened to them.
            And just as the Velvet Underground are credited as the prodigious
            founders of a new movement in rock and roll, the same can be said
            of Galaxie 500.

            Like contemporaries such as Hugo Largo and the Cowboy Junkies,
            Galaxie 500 took a slower approach to constructing and performing
            their music. And with Shimmy-Disc founder and producer Kramer at
            the helm of the mixing board, Galaxie 500 managed to achieve a
            unique sound that both captivated and repulsed critics and
            reviewers.

            Often brought up in reference to a "slow" movement in rock and
            roll today, bands such as Low, Sugar Plant, and Mazzy Star owe an
            obvious debt to Galaxie 500. Unfortunately, as with many
            intensely creative groups, differences between Dean and Damon &
            Naomi led to their premature disbanding. Dean went on to form
            Luna, and Damon & Naomi continued on together, under the name
            Damon & Naomi.

            Maybe, just maybe, if we're lucky, 20 years from now there will
            be a Galaxie 500 reunion concert (if the VU can do it, so can
            they, damn it!). Until then we have a legacy of three flawless
            albums to get us through.
                                  Gary Ruisinger <gruisinger@CCTR.UMKC.EDU>

        1.2  Luna
            Dean Wareham (guitar/vocals)
            Justin Harwood (bass)
            Sean Eden (guitar)
            Lee Wall (drums)

            After the split Dean Wareham put together Luna, with Justin
            Harwood (bass), formally of excellent New Zealand popsters The
            Chills and Stanley Demeski (drums) ex Feelies, with this line up
            they released their first album (Lunapark), subsequently the line
            up was expanded with the addition of previously unknown guitarist
            Sean Eden to their line up. A deal with major label Elektra saw
            them achieve a modicum of success, and clinched them prestigious
            support slots, most notably on the Velvet Underground's reunion
            tour of 1994. They have also managed to get some equally
            prestigious guest stars on their albums, the late Sterling
            Morrison on Bewitched, and Tom Verlaine on Penthouse.

            In summer 1996 Luna replaced Stanley Demeski with Lee Wall, about
            whom we know very little - if anyone has any info about Lee's
            work prior to joining Luna please get in touch.

        1.3  Magnetophone
            Sean O'Brien writes...
            The lineup of Magnetophone was:
            Damon Krukowski (guitar/vocals)
            Naomi Yang (bass/vocals)
            Jon Williams (guitar)
            Chris Guttmacher (drums)
            At the time, Chris was also a member of Cul-de-Sac, a band he
            left about a year and a half ago He was also the original drummer
            in Bullet Lavolta. Jon Williams is probably best remembered as
            the original guitarist in Volcano Suns, but is also a very
            prolific producer and engineer. If memory serves, Magnetophone
            played a grand total of about two shows (one of which I saw) here
            in Boston. No recordings were released, although some do exist
            (produced by Jon Willaims) I hope this helps a little.

        1.4  Pierre Etoile
            Before the split of Galaxie 500, Naomi Yang and Damon Krukowski
            recorded an EP as Pierre Etoile (it was actually released shortly
            after Galaxie 500's demise). After Galaxie 500 split they were
            encouraged by Kramer to opt for the less imaginative Damon and
            Naomi for subsequent releases.

        1.5  Damon and Naomi
            Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang, have now released two exceptional
            albums and a number of equally exceptional singles, which they've
            fitted around their other careers as artists and publishers.

        1.6  Magic Hour
            Magic Hour is a project conceived by ex Crystalized Movements
            members Wayne Rogers and Kate Biggar, who recruited Naomi Yang
            and Damon Krukowski as their rhythm section, they released three
            albums of very long songs, which are of an acquired taste - but
            in my opinion a taste well worth acquiring. After the release of
            the third album in 1996 it was decided that Magic Hour had run
            it's course. Damon & Naomi returned to work as Damon & Naomi, and
            Wayne and Kate became the Major Stars. At the Terrastock festival
            in April 1997 Magic Hour re-united for a special one-off
            performance.

        1.7  Kramer
              (Mark) Kramer is all things to all men...
                Record Company Boss
                    He is the man behind both the Shimmy Disc and Kokopop
                    record labels. He was the owner of Noise New York studio
                    where Galaxie 500 did most of their recording, and is
                    currently the owner of Noise New Jersey.
                Record Producer
                    As well as being the producer of all of Galaxie 500 and
                    Damon and Naomi's records, he has produced an awful lot
                    of the output of Shimmy Disc. Check out Grenadine and
                    Low for starters.
                Recording Artist
                    Kramer has released records as a solo artist; As member
                    of Shockabilly (with Eugene Chadbourne), Bongwater (with
                    actress Ann Magnusson - Bongwater split in 1994 in a very
                    acrimonious manner); and in collaboration with a myriad of
                    other artists including Gong, Hugh Hopper, John Hall,
                    Daevid Allen. He has also toured as a member of the
                    Butthole Surfers. His recorded output is very variable,
                    some of it is exquisite some of it is downright irritating,
                    take your chances.
                    Kramer could quite easily warrant a FAQ all of his own
                    (anyone fancy taking on that task?).

        1.8  Cagney and Lacee
            Cagney and Lacee are Dean Wareham and his wife Claudia Silver,
            they released a single, Time/By The Way (I Still Love You) on No6
            and followed it up with an album Six Feet of Chain, described on
            the cover as "An album of cover versions lovingly performed by
            Dean Wareham and Claudia Silver".

PART II - Frequently Asked Questions

    1  Where can I see ... play live?
       When are ... going to play in ...?
            As soon as I hear of any live dates I will put them on the
            Galaxie 500 - Luna - Damon & Naomi web page (see PART III/1)
            and post them on the mailing list (see PART III/2) and on the
            newsgroup alt.music.galaxie-500 (see PART III/3).
            I DO NOT get informed as a matter of course by any of the bands
            and so I rely on people telling me and by keeping an eye on the
            offical web pages (see PART III/1). If anyone hears of any dates
            I'd be grateful if you could email them to me so that I can
            notify people via the web page, mailing list and newsgroup.

    2  Where can I find Galaxie 500/Luna/Damon & Naomi guitar tabs?
        The chords to most Galaxie 500, and quite a few Luna tracks are
        available on the Galaxie 500 - Luna - Damon & Naomi web page (see PART
        III/1), you will also find links to other pages that contain tabs
        which I will add as and when I come across them.

    3  Didn't Galaxie 500 do a couple of Peel Sessions?
       Will they ever get released?
        Galaxie 500 recorded two sessions for the John Peel show - the ground
        breaking BBC radio show...
            17th October 1989
                Flowers
                Blue Thunder
                Decomposing Trees
                Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste (Richman)
            4th November 1990
                Moonshot (Buffy St Marie)
                Submission (Sex Pistols)
                When Will You Come Home
                Final Day (Moxham)
                (this version of Final Day has Naomi doing the vocal)
        According to an interview Damon & Naomi gave in Ptolemaic Terrascope
        (issue 23) these will "probably surface at some point".

    4  Why did Galaxie 500 split?
        The generally considered reasoning behind the split was simply that
        Dean Wareham decided he didn`t want to be in the band anymore.
        Damon and Naomi gave a very thorough interview in "The Ptolemaic
        Terrascope" magazine (issue 23) where they give their version of
        the events that led to the split. As far as I know Dean hasn't given
        a full explaination for his decision.

    5  Why did Stanley Demeski leave Luna?
        Stanley's reluctance to tour was the officially given reason for his
        departure from the band - these two quotes from interviews given to
        music magazine "Stomp and Stammer" (http://monsterbit.com/stammer/)
        give a bit more insight into the separation...

            "But I was never really in Luna. I was an employee of the band and
            I made it clear from the beginning that whenever we went on the
            road, I had to be paid. Then, they sort of ran out of money and at
            that point, they just kept bugging me to tour with them but I just
            wasn't that into it to be honest with you."
                        Stanley Demeski - "Stomp & Stammer" - June 1997

            "He didn't like touring I guess that was true with everyone in The
            Feelies, but I got tired of begging and twisting his arm. And it
            was kind of always that way from the beginning, he made that sort
            of clear, that he would rather stay home."
                        Dean Wareham - "Stomp & Stammer - September 1997

    6  How can I view the CD-ROM videos that were in the box set?
        Date: Wed, 2 Apr 1997 14:45:00 -0600
        From: Lars Murray <lmurray@rykodisc.mhub.com>
        Subject: Videos--One More Time

        Amazing how the various myths about the videos persist.

        If anybody is running a G500 FAQ, please include a bit about the
        Rykodisc Enhanced CD page
        (http://www.rykodisc.com/3/central/enhanced.html) All of the existing
        answers are there.

        To debunk some recent misleading info:

        1) The videos are NOT Mac-only. They will play on a
        properly-configured PC (see web page for details).

        2) NET TOOB may display the videos, but it is not a substitute for
        the proper CD-ROM drivers, without which you will not see them. Nor
        is it necessary to use NET TOOB to view them.

        3) The videos are QuickTime, not some proprietary format.

        Enjoy,
        Lars Murray
        Rykodisc

    7  Haven't I heard ... in a TV commercial?
        The Luna track "California (All The Way)" has appeared as the
        soundtrack to at least two TV commercials - Calvin Klein CK1 (in the
        US) and American Express (in the UK).

    8  What is a Galaxie 500?
        It's a make of car, there is a web page if you're really interested...

        The *official* Luna web page
            So far VERY poor web page with an old version of MY
            discography and no current news - much promise but as yet
            very little delivery - but it might get better.
                http://www.triangle23.com/luna/

        Chris's Luna discography

    2  Mailing Lists
        Okay I know, it's a remorseless plug for my own mailing list, but
        what the hell...
        The Galaxie 500 Mailing List is available in two versions -
            The full version, to subscribe send an email to...
            galaxie-request@aald.demon.co.uk
            with...
            ADD <your email address>
            in the BODY of the email.
            The digest version, to subscribe send an email to...
            galaxie-digest-request@aald.demon.co.uk
            with...
            ADD <your email address>
            in the BODY of the email.

        The official Luna web page has a form to fill in which claims the
        following...
            "By filling out this simple form, you will be automatically
            added to the Luna Mailing List, through which you can receive
            concert info and new release dates and get Luna's online newletter
            delivered right to your email box!"
        ...as yet (5th Nov 97) there has been a grand total of just one email
        from this list, since when Luna have released an album, two singles 
        and toured the US and Europe, Fortunately there are other ways to get
        Luna news. Hopefully this mailing list will actually start to provide
        some useful information in the not too distant future.

    3  Newsgroups
        In the following Newsgroups Galaxie 500 (etc.) discussion is
        acceptable...
        alt.music.galaxie-500
            Postings to the mailing list are gated into this newsgroup
            and vice-versa.
        alt.music.independent
            Lively, medium/high traffic newsgroup, with a stress on
            independent, so Luna debate may be frowned upon by Indie
            purists.
        alt.music.alternative
            Very busy newsgroup, and only recommended if you can cope
            with tedious debates about mainstream alternative Rock.
