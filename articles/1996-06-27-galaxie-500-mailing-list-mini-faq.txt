The Answers
***********

1.  Who is/are/were...

    1.1 Who were Galaxie 500?
        Galaxie 500 were a magical three piece comprising of...
                Dean Wareham    guitar/vocals
                Naomi Yang      bass/vocals
                Damon Krukowski drums

        Seminal is a word often bandied about in describing certain
        influential groups and their works. And sadly, I must use the
        hackneyed word in an attempt to convey the underrated
        greatness that was Galaxie 500. Like the Velvet Underground
        before them, Galaxie 500 didn't have a large contemporary
        audience, but they had a profound effect on almost everyone
        who listened to them. And just as the Velvet Underground are
        credited as the prodigious founders of a new movement in rock
        and roll, the same can be said of Galaxie 500.

        Like contemporaries such as Hugo Largo and the Cowboy
        Junkies, Galaxie 500 took a slower approach to constructing
        and performing their music. And with Shimmy-Disc founder and
        producer Kramer at the helm of the mixing board, Galaxie 500
        managed to achieve a unique sound that both captivated and
        repulsed critics and reviewers.

        Often brought up in reference to a "slow" movement in rock
        and roll today, bands such as Low, Sugar Plant, and Mazzy
        Star owe an obvious debt to Galaxie 500. Unfortunately, as
        with many intensely creative groups, differences between Dean
        and Damon & Naomi led to their premature disbanding. Dean
        went on to form Luna, and Damon & Naomi continued on
        together, under the name Damon & Naomi.

        Maybe, just maybe, if we're lucky, 20 years from now there
        will be a Galaxie 500 reunion concert (if the VU can do it,
        so can they, damn it!). Until then we have a legacy of three
        flawless albums to get us through.

    1.2 Who are Luna?
        After the split Dean Wareham put together Luna, with Justin
        Harwood (bass), formally of excellent New Zealand popsters
        The Chills and Stanley Demeski (drums) ex Feelies, with this
        line up they released their first album (Lunapark),
        subsequently the line up was expanded with the addition of
        previously unknown guitarist Sean Eden to their line up.
        A deal with major label Elektra saw them achieve a modicum of
        success, and clinched them prestigious support slots, most
        notably on the Velvet Underground's reunion tour of 1994.
        They have also managed to get some equally prestigious guest
        stars on their albums, the late Sterling Morrison on
        Bewitched, and Tom Verlaine on Penthouse.

    1.3.Who were Magnetophone?
        Wll this is a bit of a grey area for me, so if anyone can
        shed some light on this I'd be very grateful.
        Either during Galaxie 500's existence, or shortly afterwards
        Damon and Naomi worked on a project as Magnetophone, as far
        as I know the only product from this undertaking was an
        audio cassette.

    1.4 Who were Pierre Etoile?
        After the split of Galaxie 500 Naomi Yang and Damon Krukowski
        released an EP as Pierre Etoile before deciding on the less
        imaginative Damon and Naomi for subsequent releases (see 1.5)

    1.5 Who are Damon and Naomi?
        Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang, have now released two
        exceptional albums, which they've fitted around their other
        careers as artists and publishers.

    1.6 Who are Magic Hour?
        Magic Hour is a project conceived by ex Crystalized Movements
        members Wayne Rogers and Kate Biggar, who recruited Naomi
        Yang and Damon Krukowski as their rhythm section, they've
        released three albums of very long songs, which are of an
        acquired taste.

    1.7 Who is Kramer
        Kramer is all things to all men...

        1.7.1  Record Company Boss - He is the man behind both the
               Shimmy Disc and Kokopop record labels.

        1.7.2  Record Producer - As well as being the producer of all
               of Galaxie 500 and Damon and Naomi's records, he has
               produced an awful lot of the output of Shimmy Disc.
               Check out Grenadine and Low for starters.

        1.7.3  Recording Artist - Kramer has released records as a
               solo artist; As member of Bongwater, along with
               actress Anne Magnusson, the two of them parted company
               in 1994 in a very acrimonious manner; and in
               collaboration with other artists. His recording output
               is very variable, some of it is exquisite some of it
               is downright irritating, take your chances!


2.  Why is it so difficult to get hold of any Galaxie 500 material?

    Shortly after the bands demise, the record label that released
    the last two albums, Rough Trade, very tragically went to the
    wall. Rough Trade was the biggest and best established of the
    Independent record labels, and it's collapse saw many bands left
    rather badly in limbo, it also meant that a lot of the label's
    back catalogue instantly became unavailable. The Galaxie 500
    albums were hit by this disaster, although stocks (and I imagine
    the unexpectedly poor sales of This Is Our Music) have meant that
    copies have been seen from time to time (particularly on
    cassette).


3.  Is there any chance that in the future this material will be
    released?

    Rumours of a re-release have been banded about for quite a while,
    and in early 1995 it looked as if Sub Pop were going to be
    releasing them, however, it seems that what was left of Rough
    Trade was asking too much for the rights. However in late 1995,
    very strong rumours abounded that Rykodisc were planning on
    releasing a boxed set containing all three Galaxie 500 albums and
    a fourth album of rare and unreleased material. This now seems to
    be a certainty, with a prospective release date of September
    1996.

    LATEST NEWS
    Rykodisc to release Galaxie 500 boxed set - it`s official.
    Here's the press release...

        "Come ride the fiery breeze of Galaxie 500!" - Kramer

         After many out of print years, Galaxie 500's nearly
         impossible to find back catalog has found a home with
         Rykodisc.  On September 24, 1996, a 4 CD box set will hit
         the stores, compiling all three of their albums (Today, On
         Fire, and This Is Our Music) and adding a 4th disc of
         rarities, unreleased tracks and demos.

         Long considered pioneers of the post-Velvets atmospheric
         space-rock crowd, Galaxie 500's compositions made brilliant
         noise out of quiet. Their short career spawned some of the
         most influential music of its time, and garnered lavish
         raves from critics and press alike.

         All the records have been remastered by Kramer, resulting in
         a whole new realm of sonic excellence, and beautiful artwork
         exclusive to the box has been created by Naomi Yang.  As an
         extra bonus, their four videos (directed by Sergio Huidor)
         have been added to the discs as enhanced CD tracks that will
         playable in any CD-ROM drive, making this release a
         completist's dream come true.

5.  Why is my Gigantic!2 CD changing colour?

        PDO
        A number of faulty CDs were pressed by a company called PDO
        during the late 80s and early 90s (including Gigantic!2).
        A decaying CD will become bronze tinged, and will eventually
        begin to lose sound quality.
        PDO have a policy of replacing these deteriorating CDs free
        of charge they can be contacted at...
