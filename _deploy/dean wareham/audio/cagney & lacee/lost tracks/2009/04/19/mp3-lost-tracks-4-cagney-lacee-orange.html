<meta name="description" content="Cagney &amp; Lacee was Dean Wareham and his (then) wife Claudia Silver. They released an album and a couple of singles between 1996 and 1998. The album, Six Feet of Chain was described on the sleeve as &quot;[an] album of cover versions lovingly performed by Dean Wareham and Claudia Silver&quot; and featured covers of tracks by Lee Hazlewood and Minnie Ripperton as well as a couple of tracks from the (excellent) Robert Altman film Nashville. The couple&#39;s last release was put out on the excellent UK label Earworm as part of their subscription only singles club and featured a cover of Madonna&#39;s Borderline as well as the only Cagney &amp; Lacee original to have seen the light of day. So here, for your enjoyment is that Silver/Wareham penned track - &quot;Orange.&quot; This has been lifted from my vinyl copy. I&#39;m not an audiophile and I don&#39;t have expensive kit so what you are about to hear/download is not likely to sound as good as it probably ought to, but then...you didn&#39;t pay for it. I&#39;m not sure how difficult it is to get hold of this (a quick scour of the Internet didn&#39;t produce much). You can get the two tracks from their earlier single as mp3 downloads as part of a compilation called &quot;Speed Dating&quot; which also includes the tracks from Dean Wareham&#39;s Anesthesia solo single. Their are also several second hand copies of the album, Six Feet of Chain, on Amazon." />
