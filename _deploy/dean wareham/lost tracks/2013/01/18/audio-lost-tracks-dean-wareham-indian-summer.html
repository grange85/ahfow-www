<p>This cover of Beat Happening's Indian Summer turned up on a 7" single given away with issue #7 of Chemical Imbalance and was recorded while Galaxie 500 were still a going concern. I don't think it gets a mention in Black Postcards (although I don't have a searchable version as yet - a Kindle issue would be nice sometime - particularly as my hardback is falling apart - a good fan would have taken more care of his signed copy!).<br />

Damon mentioned it in <a href="http://www.terrascope.co.uk/MyBackPages/Damon_and_Naomi.htm">the Ptolemaic Terrascope interview</a> but only in passing...</p>

<p>Of course Indian Summer was to become a staple of Luna's set throughout their life - they played it as their first London show in 1992 and was the last song they played in London in 2005 (and the second last song they ever played).</p>
