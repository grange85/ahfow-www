    <p>Dean doesn’t often venture into production - this was an early outing, I think it was recorded at the same time as Pee Shy’s <em>Who Let All The Monkeys Out</em> album (which will turn up later in this series) and released before the album on Tampa, FL indie Screw Music Forever - <a href="http://www.screwmusicforever.com/">although they weirdly don’t seem to admit it on their (admittedly rather broken) website</a>.</p>

<p>The single was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>recorded in 1995 - as was Luna’s Penthouse</li>
  <li>engineered by Mario Salvati - as was Luna’s Penthouse</li>
  <li>recorded at Sorcerer Sound in NYC - as was Luna’s Penthouse</li>
  <li>and, obv, involved Dean Wareham… as did Luna’s Penthouse</li>
</ul>

<p>The single is a little less polished than the album, Yellow Race Car is a cool bit of noisy mid-90s guitar rock. The b-side is a gentler, piano-driven affair. Both tracks are well worth a listen and since I can’t find this online to link to, here are recordings from my single.</p>

<p>Now I have vague memories about Dean mentioning this production job in an interview, but haven’t tracked that down and probably shouldn’t guess at what I think he might have said.</p>

<p>I only got my paws on a copy of this in 2017 for a fiver on Discogs. I had the album from not long after it’s release in 1996.</p>
