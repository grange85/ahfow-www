    <p>Illumination was the second album by The Pastels that Dean guested on - the sleeve notes aren’t kind enough to tell who appeared on what track so I guess you have to listen closely! For some reason I’ve shared <em>Rough Riders</em> when I’ve written about this before - I must have known that from somewhere?</p>

<div class="text-center"><figure class="figure w-100"><img src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/my-record-collection-pastels-illumination.jpg" class="figure-image img-fluid rounded mx-auto" alt="The Pastels - Illumination" /><figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">The Pastels - Illumination</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Illumination is a fantastic album that I don’t listen to enough… maybe my favourie album by The Pastels (and not just because Dean’s on it).</p>

<p>There’s a cool interview with some of the main players from around the <a href="https://www.soul-kitchen.fr/75487-1997-2017-illumination-toile-de-maitre-pastels">20th anniversary of the album by French magazine Soul Kitchen</a> (it is available in both French and English). I’ve pinched Dean’s bit…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SK:</strong> How did you meet The Pastels?<br />
<strong>Dean:</strong> We met backstage at a Galaxie 500 show in Glasgow, must have been 1990, I think it was at the College of Printing and Building.<br />
<strong>SK:</strong> How easy was your recording process of your guitar and your vocals?<br />
<strong>Dean:</strong> I think I was in the studio just one day, or two days at most. Recording the guitars was quick, recording my backing vocal was harder.  <br />
<strong>SK:</strong> What’s your best memory of this recording process?<br />
<strong>Dean:</strong> I remember it was sunny in Glasgow and I remember drinking Scotch with Katrina and Stephen.<br />
<strong>SK:</strong> What’s your favorite song of this LP?<br />
<strong>Dean:</strong> Probably “Viaduct” — so sad and pretty, seems like it’s a song about being in a band, I love the lyrics:<br />
<em>were we ever inspired / just for a moment / or is this our life? / slackness in the blackness….
can’t you see I’m trying to tell you? / We’ve paid our dues</em></p>

<p>There’s a lovely pic of all the album’s collaborators which lived on Jonathan Kilgour’s near-official website back in the day!</p>
