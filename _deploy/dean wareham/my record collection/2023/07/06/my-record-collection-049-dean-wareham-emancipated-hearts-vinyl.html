    <p>Emancipated Hearts was released in the autumn of 2013 - it’s a six track LP that was released as a lovely orange 10” by Sonic Cathedral (and in another colour - possibly black - on Double Feature) - the album was produced by Jason Quever (Papercuts) and featured 26 minutes of music… which gets me thinking about formats.</p>

<div class="text-center"><figure class="figure w-100"><img src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/emancipated-hearts-10-lp.jpg" class="figure-image img-fluid rounded mx-auto" alt="Emancipated Hearts LP" /><figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Emancipated Hearts LP</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Now, I have always had opinions on formats - it’s pretty simple</p>

<ol>
  <li>A single… is 7” of vinyl, runs at 45rpm, and has 3 or 4 minutes of music on each side - normally one song/track per side…<br />
   <em>e.g. Galaxie 500 - Tugboat / King of Spain</em></li>
  <li>A 12” (or occasionally 10”) single… is 12” (or occasionally 10”) of vinyl, runs at 45rpm, and runs a bit longer, and plays a bit louder, than a 7” single…
   <em>e.g. Galaxie 500 - Fourth of July / Here She Comes Now</em></li>
  <li>An EP… is 7” of vinyl, runs at <strong>45rpm</strong>, and has 7 or 8 minutes of music on each side - normally two songs/tracks per side…<br />
   <em>e.g. The Beatles - Twist &amp; Shout EP</em></li>
  <li>An LP… is 10” <strong>or</strong> 12” of vinyl, runs at 33rpm, and has 12 to 15 (10”) or 15 to 25 (12”) minutes on each side
   _e.g.
    <ul>
      <li>Galaxie 500 - On Fire (12”)</li>
      <li><em>Dean Wareham - Emancipated Hearts</em> (10”)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>A 12” EP… doesn’t exist… it’s a 12” single <em>see above</em>.</li>
  <li>A <em>mini LP</em> is an LP (<em>see above</em>) or a 12” (or 10”) single (<em>see above</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>everything else is an aberration!</em></p>

<p>So, when Dean says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[M]y mini-LP or maxi-EP (<strong>since it’s 10” vinyl it is not an LP</strong>) is out at last. 
  <em>Dean Wareham Newsletter - 15th October 2013</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>… he’s wrong - it runs at 33rpm and has 25’46” of music. OK, I’ll grant that just under 26 minutes is at the short end of LP length - but it’s not far off Dylan’s Nashville Skyline (26’46”), Nick Drake’s Pink Moon (28’22”) - and out-runs The Beach Boys’ Wild Honey (23’58”) by a couple of minutes!</p>

<p>I should also point out that the catalogue number of this vinyl release is SCR047<strong>LP</strong>!</p>

<p>So, Emancipated Hearts is an LP, and was Dean’s first solo LP. I rest my case.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Catalogue Number:</em> AHFOW 12/0025</li>
  <li><em>Artist:</em> Dean Wareham</li>
  <li><em>Title:</em> Emancipated Hearts</li>
  <li><em>Notes:</em> orange vinyl</li>
  <li><em>Packaging:</em> card sleeve</li>
  <li><em>Format:</em> 10” LP</li>
  <li>Bought from <em>Sonic Cathedral</em> for £12 (plus £3.50 postage) - which is frankly a bargain for an album!</li>
