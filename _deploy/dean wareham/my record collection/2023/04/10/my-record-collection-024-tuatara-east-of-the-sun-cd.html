    <p>When I first started the AHFoW discography I created some criteria about what should be included, although I sometimes strayed. Criteria #1 was that it had to have a direct relationship to a former member of Galaxie 500. That meant that I didn’t include the side project that Luna’s Justin Harwood was involved in ‘Tuatara’ - or at least didn’t include it until <em>East of the Sun</em>, their fourth or fifth album, and a record with no input from Justin†. However, Dean Wareham does put in a vocal appearance on two tracks.</p>

<p>Tuatara seem to be a band that the world struggles to describe - Wikipedia call them an <em>instrumental music group</em> which was I guess pretty much true up until this album. East of the Sun (and it’s partner <em>West of the Moon</em>) are most definitley not <em>instrumental</em> - inlcuding lots of guest vocalists of which Dean is one. I think the singers probably make Tuatara sound a little more… conventional… than those earlier albums.</p>

<p>Other words that turn up in Tuatara reviews are <em>jazz</em> and <em>fusion</em> and <em>Americana</em> and <em>soft rock</em> and <em>soundtrack</em> - but I suspect that just means that reviewers don’t know where to file them.</p>

<p>They’re def better than that Pitchfork review you might’ve come across suggests!</p>

<p>Here are Dean’s contributions, Trouble Rides In and Your Ghost Town:</p>
