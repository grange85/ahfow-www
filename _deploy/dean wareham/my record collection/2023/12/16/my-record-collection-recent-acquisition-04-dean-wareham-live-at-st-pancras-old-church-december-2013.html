<p>This entry will cover three rows in my collection spreadsheet becuase I’ve <a href="/2023/02/23/my-record-collection-011-dean-wareham-live-at-st-pancras-old-church-red-cassette/">already written about one cassette version</a> and have another one at some point in the future. Since I have three copies of the LP recently acquired it would be a bit hard on you (and me) to cover them three times!</p>

<p>“Three copies!?” I hear you say, “is he mad!?”</p>

<p>Well, “yes” is probably the answer, but, I’d better explain - so here are some bullet point facts to try and explain my madness.</p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
  <li>I was at the shows that make up this live album, so you can hear me cheering. Well you would if I ever actually cheered at gigs. You can probably hear me applauding enthusiastically!</li>
  <li>They were a couple of my favourite shows, the venue was great, the circumstances were unique.</li>
  <li>My son Adam also came along. I think this was his first time seeing Dean live (not counting a soundcheck at on over 18s show when he was under 18). He was 16 for this one but … no age restriction to get into a church! He may have been more thrilled at being backstage with Sonic Boom.</li>
  <li>Nat at Sonic Cathedral sent me a test pressing when the album was announced a couple of months back, so … <strong>copy #1 - AHFOW 12/0095</strong></li>
  <li>There is a limited edition Bandcamp exclusive in gold vinyl so I sort of had to have that. So … <strong>copy #2 - AHFOW 12/0096</strong></li>
  <li>The record stores have a red/green vinyl version.</li>
  <li>Adam, since he was there, wanted a copy so I have bought him the red/green copy <em>to look after</em>! So … <strong>copy #3 - AHFOW 12/0097</strong></li>
  <li>OK, I had actually ordered that one before he said he wanted a copy! And it is currently in my possession!</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I have three copies on vinyl, and two on cassette. So just five copies (so far) - still a way to go to <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/pictures/galaxie-500-on-fire-x-7.jpg">catch up with “On Fire”</a>.</p>
