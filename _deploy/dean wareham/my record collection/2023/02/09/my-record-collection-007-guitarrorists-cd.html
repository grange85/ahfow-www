    <p>Well I know exactly how much I paid for Guitarrorists because it still has a sizeable <em>SALE £3.99</em> sticker on the front. I also know that I bought it from an HMV since the sticker on the back is kind enough to tell me that.

<p>£3.99 is a bargain for…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A compilation of 26 instrumental tracks from the guitar players for<br />
SONIC YOUTH<br />
DINOSAUR JR.
BIG BLACK<br />
GALAXIE 500<br />
SPACEMEN 3<br />
BUTTHOLE SURFERS<br />
and 20 others</p>
</blockquote>

<p>… but not <em>that much</em> of a bargain, I don’t listen to it that often. And given that my motivation for buying it was for the Dean Wareham track “West Broadway” and given that that checks in at just 2’42” … maybe £3.99 is probably as much as I ought to have paid?</p>
