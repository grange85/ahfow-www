<meta name="description" content="13 Most Beautiful A couple of Dean Wareham interviews have just been broadcast and well worth listening to. First up Dean was interviewed on Saturday afternoon&#39;s Todd-o-phonic Todd show on WFMU - you can listen to the interview where Dean talks about the upcoming Dean &amp; Britta / 13 Most Beautiful Show in Philadelphia and also touches on the new Luna covers album that has been hinted at over the last few months. Todd: You&#39;re coming out with a new album of covers Dean: That&#39;s the plan. We&#39;ve been recording in a studio here, bit by bit whenever we&#39;re all in the same town and it&#39;s kind of an easy way to get back into it. T: Are there any teasers regarding songs that you would like to share with my millions of listeners today D: Here&#39;s one, talking about the Velvets still, we&#39;ve actually done this song &#39;Friends&#39; from the Squeeze album Todd-o-phonic Todd - WFMU 3rd December 2016" />

<p class="lead">A couple of Dean Wareham interviews have just been broadcast and well worth listening to.</p>
<p>First up Dean was interviewed on Saturday afternoon's <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/69879">Todd-o-phonic Todd show on WFMU</a> - you can listen to the interview where Dean talks about the upcoming <a href="/database/dean-and-britta/shows/2016/2016-12-15-dean-and-britta-the-gershman-y-philadelphia-pa-usa/">Dean &amp; Britta / 13 Most Beautiful Show in Philadelphia</a> and also touches on the new Luna covers album that has been hinted at over the last few months.</p>

<p>Next up <a href="http://www.fidelityhigh.com/#/dean-wareham-podcast/">Dean Wareham talks about The Feelies debut album Crazy Rhythms for Fidelity High</a>.</p>
<blockquote>It's really hard to pick just one song fron this. It's an album that's perfect from beginning to end, and by that actually I mean from song one to nine, because there are subsequent CD editions that add other songs. But I think I'll have to go with the title track, which is the final track it's Crazy Rhythms.
