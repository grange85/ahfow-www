<p>Buffy commented on one of Dean's cover versions in the Magnet interview, although it's not clear which one...</p>
<blockquote><p>I saw your version of "Moonshot" on YouTube. Thank you!! It's just gorgeous, and I was so touched when I came upon it — by accident — several months ago. Some of my favorite songs are real obscure like "Moonshot." Hardly anyone knows them. I like your taste. Anyway, many thanks for doing this. I went to your website — cool.</p></blockquote>
