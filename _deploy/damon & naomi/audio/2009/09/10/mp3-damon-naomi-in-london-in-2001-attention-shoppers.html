<meta name="description" content="I don&#39;t have many recordings of Damon &amp; Naomi - at most gigs since this one in 2001 my taping buddy hasn&#39;t been able to tape for various reasons (and had one failure - and doesn&#39;t come out so often these days). This was a great show, support had come from The Clientele (first or second time I&#39;d seen them) and The Trembling Blue Stars (sadly neither of their sets were taped). Damon &amp; Naomi were over with Michio Kurihara on the tour that would end with the &quot;Live in San Sebasitan&quot; deception (go read your Sub Pop Years liner notes). I didn&#39;t often bother making sleeves for the recordings I have, but I did for this one. The picture was not from London but from Holland (I think) on the same tour, and was from a set sent to me to put on the website by the photographer Stefan Claudius. I didn&#39;t get permission to bung it on my CD sleeve but then it was never meant for sharing. Stefan&#39;s photos also turned up in the &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; CD booklet. Anyway... great show - you can see my original review here. Download Attention Shoppers from Mediafire (93MB) (booklet / insert)" />

<p>I don't have many recordings of Damon &amp; Naomi - at most gigs since this one in 2001 my taping buddy hasn't been able to tape for various reasons (and had one failure - and doesn't come out so often these days). This was a great show, support had come from <a href="http://www.theclientele.co.uk/">The Clientele</a> (first or second time I'd seen them) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trembling_Blue_Stars">The Trembling Blue Stars</a> (sadly neither of their sets were taped). Damon &amp; Naomi were over with Michio Kurihara on the tour that would end with the "Live in San Sebasitan" deception (go read your Sub Pop Years liner notes).</p>
<p>I didn't often bother making sleeves for the recordings I have, but I did for this one. The picture was not from London but from Holland (I think) on the same tour, and was from a set sent to me to put on the website by the photographer Stefan Claudius. I didn't get permission to bung it on my CD sleeve but then it was never meant for sharing. Stefan's photos also turned up in the "Song to the Siren" CD booklet.</p>
