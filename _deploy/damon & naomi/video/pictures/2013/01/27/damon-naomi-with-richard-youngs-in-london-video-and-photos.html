Damon &amp; Naomi are now the support act, I don't entirely have a problem with this because it's not as if they support acts that I don't enjoy (<a href="/2010/12/19/review-damon-naomi-and-the-clientele-in-london/">The Clientele in 2010</a> and Richard Youngs tonight), my main problem is that I feel a little sad at 40 minute sets, the back catalogue is rich and sadly becoming neglected, I know a band has to move on but as I get older I seem to be getting more and more enjoyment from wallowing deeply and luxuriantly in my past.<br />

Last night's show did dip back as far as Judah and The Maccabees for the set closer so I don't really have anything to moan about.<br />

Cafe Oto was sold out, and the crowd was beautifully quiet and the show was of course, like every Damon &amp; Naomi concert, a joy.</p>
<p>Headline act Richard Youngs was joined on drums and backing vocals by Damon for a varied set of noise, songs, jams, improvisations and a stand-up routine.<br />
