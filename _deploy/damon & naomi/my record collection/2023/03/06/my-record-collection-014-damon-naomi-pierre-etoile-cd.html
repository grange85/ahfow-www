<p>I can’t find where and when I bought this - although it was pretty late on because I did buy the EP from iTunes in 2010 so I assume I didn’t have a CD copy then. I also bought a copy via Bandcamp in 2017 - shocking that I’ve even been doubling up my downloads. I kind of hope Hazel doesn’t read this and find out how much I’ve been spending on music I already own! <em>Although… she probably already has some idea!</em></p>

<p>I’ve always been slightly disappointed in the sleeve of this issue - probably because I loved the sleeve of the original so much. But, looking at it now I do rather like the design even if the sleeve photograph is a little… uninspired.</p>
