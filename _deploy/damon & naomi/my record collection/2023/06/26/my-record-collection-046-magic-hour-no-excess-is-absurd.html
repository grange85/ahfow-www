    <p>No Excess Is Absurd was Magic Hour’s first album and is the one with the bonus of having Naomi doing a gorgeous vocal on their <a href="/2014/04/09/originals-sally-free-and-easy-by-trees-covered-by-magic-hour/">cover of folk standard Sally Free and Easy</a>. It was released in the uk by Che records and I would have bought this round the time it was released in 1994.</p>

<p>Now, 1994 was the very early days of the Internet, I started A Head Full of Wishes in the autumn of that year. Magic Hour toured the UK in October 1994 … I managed to miss <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/03-damon_and_naomi/pictures/1994-10-08-magic-hour-tour-news-nme.png">this news item in NME</a> and so managed to <em>not</em> see them when they toured. There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JveFMa97YU/">video of their show at The Sausage Machine in Camden on the 28th October</a> which should make me happy but just makes me all the more annoyed that I missed it.</p>

<p>My CD of this is dying. When they were new, CDs were pitched as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMp1pSVxoqw&amp;t=28s">being indestructible</a> but… no, turns out this was nonsense - in fact not indestructible rather they fail more catastrophically - I’ll have a story to tell about this in a later post. Luckily… No Excess is Absurd is one of the many releases in this series I have multiple copies of so my dying Che CD isn’t a complete catastrophe.</p>
