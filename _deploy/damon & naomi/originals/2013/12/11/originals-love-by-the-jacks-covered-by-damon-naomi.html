<meta name="description" content="So.. an album track by 60s Japanese psych/folk/rock band, that ain&#39;t gonna be on YouTube is it... and it wasn&#39;t, but it is now. Love was released on The Jacks 1968 album Vacant World, I&#39;ll pinch Wikipedia&#39;s description of the band because I rather love how The Jacks pretty much cover everything ... Jacks played in a distinct musical style fused with ambient psychedelic, surf, folk and jazz. The group had a dark, introspective sound with an exploratory, improvisational edge and sometimes headed into moody instrumental excursions. The Jacks typically employed reverb, tremolo and subtle fuzz-guitar and also utilized the vibraphone, organ and wind instruments such as the flute. (play on YouTube) There&#39;s a tremendously thorough article on Jacks at Garage Hangover. Damon &amp; Naomi recorded it in 2001 for their fake live album Live in San Sebastian - here they are performing it with members of Ghost, saxophonist Bhob Rainey and cellist Helene Espvall in Tokyo in 2008 (play on YouTube) See all posts in the Originals series" />
