<p>I thought as a seasonal addendum I'd hunt down a few classic versions, but beyond Darlene Love's perfect version on the Spector Christmas album, almost no one has managed to make a go of it - some songs, I guess are just awful - even a song that's sold 100 million copies!</p>

<p>There's a 1972 cover that is described on Wikipedia as...</p>
<blockquote><p> Shu-Bi-Dua, Denmark, released a rock version of the song under the title "Rap Jul" ("Quack Christmas") with Danish lyrics depicting a duck (that turns out to be none other than Donald Duck) not looking forward to Christmas, because all humans tend to eat duck at Christmas Eve.</p></blockquote>
<p>... which sounds like it'd be awesome but frankly I'm afraid it's <a href="http://youtu.be/fXlyRjshoGc">still a bit of a turd</a>.</p>
<p>I'll stop there with the advice that aside from D&amp;N and Darlene Love's versions I'd suggest you give White Christmas a wide berth and find yourself another Christmas classic, personally I'd recommend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARq6uYSsUq0">this one</a></p>
