<p>I Wonder If I Care as Much, like Living Too Close to the Ground, also appeared on the boys 1968 album Roots, although had originally been recorded in 1957 as the b-side of Bye Bye Love.</p>

<p>Damon &amp; Naomi covered it in 2007 for a La blogothèque video session and it is certainly a cover of the 1968 version.</p>
