<p>Damon &amp; Naomi’s first show in London in over four years was at Cafe Oto on a Sunday afternoon, and I have to admit that a Sunday afternoon is a perfect time for a Damon &amp; Naomi gig. No having to hurry, or worse <a href="/2009/09/05/review-damon-naomi-cafe-oto-london/">leave early</a>, to have to catch the last train, time to mill around afterwards and chat, and walking from a gig into the sunshine is a special feeling. It helped that the gig <em>was</em> special.</p>

<p>In the four years since they played I had moved from London, where most bands play, to the North East of England, just outside Newcastle, where lots of bands don’t. Damon &amp; Naomi couldn’t get a gig in Newcastle so I made the trip to London. One of the reasons we chose Newcastle was because it was an easy journey to London, so easy that I could leave at a sensible time on a Sunday morning and arrive at Cafe Oto in plenty of time for a Sunday afternoon gig.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/53167530152/in/album-72177720310997512/">Richard Youngs opened the show</a> with a rambling, apologetic introduction. The apology was for his underpreparedness, that occasionally showed through; the faces he pulled as he hit a wrong piano chord added somewhat to the charm of the set.</p>

<p>Damon &amp; Naomi opened with a couple of songs from A Sky Record, and then a couple of older songs before Naomi cast aside the keyboard and strapped on <em><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/53167531837/in/album-72177720310997512/">that bass</a></em> for a run of even older songs including In The Sun from their first release, the Pierre Etoile EP (although with Naomi on vocals so tehnically I guess from Playback Singers) and then stepped back even further into the past with Galaxie 500’s Another Day which they have been playing live for a couple of years… but now, with <em>that bass</em> - so, extra special.</p>

<p>They were then pulled back on stage for an encore, despite the approaching curfew, of their beautiful cover of Tum Buckley’s Song to The Siren. And then it was over.</p>

<p>I hung around and chatted briefly to Damon, got a selfie with Naomi, and then… into the sun, and onto a bus.</p>

<div class="text-center"><figure class="figure w-100"><img src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/03-damon_and_naomi/pictures/damon-and-naomi-cafe-oto-2023-09-03-002.jpg" class="figure-image img-fluid rounded mx-auto" alt="Naomi Yang at Cafe Oto" /><figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Naomi Yang at Cafe Oto</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Two days later <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw0VkkMNdHD/">Damon tested positive for COVID</a> and Naomi took to a stage without Damon for the first time ever (with Richard Youngs coming on as a sub).</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/albums/72177720310997512">stack more, but mostly quite similar, pictures on Flickr</a></li>
  <li>There is also <a href="https://youtu.be/HgjfR8zeYew?si=7NohK11RvHm8XWuQ&amp;t=87">video I took of How Long</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully the <em>adventures</em> Damon always seems to have when he visits the UK don’t put him off from coming back soon… and maybe to Newcastle!</p>
