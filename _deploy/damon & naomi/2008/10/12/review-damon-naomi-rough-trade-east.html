<meta name="description" content="Damon &amp; Naomi @ Rough Trade East After a rather tiring and unsatisfying traipse around East London (we&#39;ll return soon with a better plan - there&#39;s so much to see and yet we managed to see almost nothing). We got to Rough Trade East in plenty of time, picked up our wristbands said &quot;hi&quot; to Damon &amp; Naomi and introduced them to Adam (because that&#39;s what proud parents do when they get the chance) and then idled away until show time. Not getting a coffee because the Rough Trade espresso bar decided to close before the gig, and the thought of negotiating the hordes in/around Brick Lane was just too much for us to contemplate. Damon &amp; Naomi &amp; Alasdair (MacLean of The Clientele) took the stage for their short set while a crowd of 40 or so watched on. The setlist was... Ueno Station Song To The Siren The Robot Speaks Turn Of The Century Cruel Queen Damon&#39;s damaged finger prevented them from playing any songs from the album they were plugging (More Sad Hits) but a good selection of tracks and it was a treat to hear Cruel Queen as I was a bit disappointed they didn&#39;t play it last time they were in town. Over far too quickly, we chatted with Naomi, she quizzed Adam on whether he&#39;d enjoyed the show (&quot;it was alright&quot;) and then we made our way home. As we hung around after the show a flyer was popped into my hand telling me that they&#39;d be back in town on January 9th at The Luminaire (!) which seemed to be a surprise to Naomi when I showed it to her.

<p>After a rather tiring and unsatisfying traipse around East London (we'll return soon with a better plan - there's so much to see and yet we managed to see almost nothing). We got to Rough Trade East in plenty of time, picked up our wristbands said "hi" to Damon &amp; Naomi and introduced them to Adam (because that's what proud parents do when they get the chance) and then idled away until show time.
