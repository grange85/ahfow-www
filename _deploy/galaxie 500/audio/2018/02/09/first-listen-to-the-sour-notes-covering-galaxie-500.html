<meta name="description" content="The Sour Notes A couple of years ago Jared from Austin band The Sour Notes got in touch with me before Xmas asking if I could plug their upcoming New Year&#39;s Eve set they were playing as Galaxie 500. I liked what I heard of the band and did what I could - not sure if my influence sold any tickets but I always like to pretend my influence is greater than it is! The band have now been in the studio and recorded a cover of Galaxie 500&#39;s Fourth of July along with a bunch of other cover versions by artists as diverse as The Beatles, Patti Smith, Beyonc&eacute; and The Ronettes (and many more). Last week Jared of the band got in touch with me and let me hear their cover it&#39;s rather lovely, he then asked if I&#39;d like to premiere the track on A Head Full of Wishes&hellip; The Sour Notes - This Is Not Our Music I figured it&#39;d be cool to premiere the Fourth of July cover through AHFoW, since we&#39;re all fans, doing it for the fans! I mean, I wouldn&#39;t be playing and recording music at this rate, if it weren&#39;t for that desire to achieve the sonic bliss I hear in bands like Galaxie 500. We&#39;re just showing our appreciation to the bands we love by releasing a covers album for free. We got the idea to record the track after we learned and performed a set of Galaxie 500 songs a couple New Year&#39;s Eves ago at Hotel Vegas in Austin. We had a few recorded covers sitting around, that we&#39;d released as bonus tracks previously, and decided to record a bunch more to make an album out of it. I tried to make each cover a little uniquely-different from the original and ended up substituting Dean&#39;s lead guitar for analog synth. After picking apart every piece of this song from the original recording and even Galaxie 500 / Luna live performances of it&hellip; it still sounds as exciting and new to me as ever!" />
