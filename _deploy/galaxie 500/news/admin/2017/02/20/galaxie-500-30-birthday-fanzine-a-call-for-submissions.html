Dean Wareham - Black Postcards pages 33-34 So, come the end of May, Galaxie 500 will reach the grand old age of 30 which seems an appropriate cause for a fan celebration and I thought it would be nice if that celebration had some fan-focussed physical manifestation - and I guess the standard form for that would be a fanzine. For that I need contributions, that could include: Words (reviews, opinions, memories, poems, etc.) Pictures (art, photography, etc.) Ideas Offers of help with design/layout/distribution etc. It&#39;s probably fairly clear that this idea can currently be filed in the &quot;half-baked&quot; category but I&#39;d like to think there&#39;s enough of us, and enough love, to pull this off. I have to admit, at this point, that the idea wasn&#39;t original and is ripping off this lovely Felt fanzine from a few years ago - that took a year and was very classy - we have less than three months so our ambition should probably be scaled appropriately. Please get in touch if you can offer any of the above, or anything else to help make this happen." />
