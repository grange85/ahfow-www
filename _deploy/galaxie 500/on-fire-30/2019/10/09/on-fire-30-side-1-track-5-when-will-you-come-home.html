<p>For research I sat and watched Kojak on my own, on my phone a few weeks back!

<blockquote>
  <p>Wasn’t there an animal related controversy about “When Will You Come Home”?</p>

  <p><em>Damon</em>: Sergio gravitated to violent imagery for all the videos, I think in part to undermine the band’s pastoral reputation, but also it’s also always anchored somehow to the lyric. It was a briliant leap. I still can’t watch “When Will You Come Home” without flinching, however.</p>

  <p><em>Dean</em>: There was a bit of controversy. We were asked to re-cut the video because it contained disturbing images of animals that had been used in scientific experiments. But then MTV ran the original version anyway. It was confusing.<br />
