From Damon &amp; Naomi&#39;s personal archive, an original copy of Galaxie 500&#39;s debut 7&quot; single &quot;Tugboat,&quot; on blue vinyl. There were 500 numbered copies of this first pressing sold. This is an UNNUMBERED copy from Damon &amp; Naomi&#39;s own collection, never offered for sale. This copy has never been played and although the sleeve shows its age from yellowing and a bit of creasing around the single, this is old new stock and therefore MINT/MINT. (But please note this is also sold AS IS, any flaws should be considered a part of this original artifact.)" />

<p>Damon & Naomi have put up for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/323426224076">auction a mint/unplayed copy of Galaxie 500's first single Tugboat</a> with all proceeds going to Beto O'Rourkes senate campaign.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Damon & Naomi's personal archive, an original copy of Galaxie 500's debut 7" single "Tugboat," on blue vinyl. There were 500 numbered copies of this first pressing sold. This is an UNNUMBERED copy from Damon & Naomi's own collection, never offered for sale. This copy has never been played and although the sleeve shows its age from yellowing and a bit of creasing around the single, this is old new stock and therefore MINT/MINT. (But please note this is also sold AS IS, any flaws should be considered a part of this original artifact.)</p>

<p>We are putting this one-of-a-kind collector's item up for auction to benefit #BETOFORTEXAS, the campaign of Beto O'Rourke to become senator from Texas. As reported recently in the press, Beto was an indie rocker before he was a politician - and among the recordings that have surfaced is one of him playing drums on a cover of Galaxie 500's version of Jonathan Richman's "Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste." Let's bond together and not let our country go to waste - end the corruption of politics by supporting campaigns that reject corporate money, like Beto O'Rourke's. And wherever you are, VOTE.
</p>
<p>100% PURCHASE PRICE TO BE DONATED TO THE BETO FOR TEXAS CAMPAIGN. BE GENEROUS. </p>

<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Another seller is auctioning TWO copies of Tugboat, also in aid of Beto O'Rourke's campaign:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Original copies of Galaxie 500's debut 7" single "Tugboat," #488/500 on Blue Vinyl, along with the Black Vinyl version. Paper Sleeves are bright white with no ripping, about as MINT/MINT as you’re ever going to find.  These are historic items, certainly not to be played.</p>
<p>I am following in the footsteps of Damon & Naomi, placing these one-of-a-kind collector's item up for auction to benefit #BETOFORTEXAS, the campaign of Beto O'Rourke to become Senator from Texas.</p>
<p>I have the world’s largest collection of Galaxie 500 music and  music memorabilia, with this election giving me cause to part with these two gems.  Both records are resting in plastic sleeves, the record jackets are also housed in their own plastic sleeves, as it the altar rare and seldom seen AURORA RECORDS FLYER, also in mint condition.</p>
<p>100% PURCHASE PRICE TO BE DONATED TO THE BETO FOR TEXAS CAMPAIGN. BE GENEROUS. </p>
<p>I can not implore you enough to VOTE, and please encourage your friends to VOTE as well.</p>
