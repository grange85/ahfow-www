<p>So… at, I’d guess about 22:30 on 27th June 1990 this happened (38 minutes and 22 seconds in):</p>

<p>… this pretty much changed the course of my life… as follows:</p>

<p><strong>1990</strong>: I was working in the film stores at the BBC - not a great job but the pay wasn’t too bad (with some overtime) and enabled me to get out and see gigs. I’d already been there six years (apart from a 18 months as a film projectionist) so it was looking like I was stuck there.</p>

<p><strong>22:30 1990-06-27</strong> - Galaxie 500 returned to the stage for an encore after a brilliant main set - they were joined by Kramer and played Ceremony, followed by Don’t Let Our Youth Go To Waste. I was mesmerised.</p>

<p><strong>1994</strong>: I’d been messing around with the internet from pretty early on and towards the end of 1994 I acquired some free web space. But what to do? So I taught myself how to code for the web and built a Galaxie 500 web page, because I still remembered that feeling from four years before. I was now a webmaster!</p>

<p>I’d now been working in film stores ten years… it was definitely looking like I was stuck there.</p>

<p><strong>1995</strong>: I set up a mailing list for Galaxie 500 (and Luna and Damon &amp; Naomi) fans.</p>

<p><strong>1999</strong>: I’d managed to get a job working on a European digitisation project, I shared an office with BBC I&amp;A’s first <em>media managers</em> who were then asked to help work on developing an intranet site for BBC Information &amp; Archives - Research Central - I found myself roped in as the only person who had any experience developing for the web (<strong><em>becuase of Galaxie 500</em></strong>). I ended up doing quite a lot of the work on it. At some point it became my full time job.</p>

<figure><img src="https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/images/research-gateway.jpg" class="img-fluid" /><figcaption>Research Gateway in 2005</figcaption></figure>
<p>Research Central changed over the years, it became research.gateway, and then Research Gateway - the job changed, the site changed - as people learned the web they needed less help and more tools - we gave them that.</p>

<p><strong>200?</strong>: Actually I’m not sure exactly when, the powers that be decided that my skills (<strong><em>because of Galaxie 500</em></strong>) would be put to better use not as part of the archives but as part of the wider BBC intranet. Lots of people thought this was a good thing - but… taking me away from archives wasn’t good at all. Unfortunately over the following few years a variety of managers came and went and none of them had a clue what to do with us.</p>

<p><strong>2013</strong>: After too many years of doing nothing and not getting anywhere I happened upon an advert for a job as the Webmaster at <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk">The National Archives</a>. I applied for, and got, the job <strong><em>because of, you know… Galaxie 500</em></strong>. I was back in an archive. Home.</p>

<p><strong>2020</strong>: 30 years on and I still get a buzz thinking about that show, 26 years on… still a webmaster.</p>
