<p>When Rykodisc re-issued the Galaxie 500 catalogue in 1996 we were probbably at the vinyl nadir so the albums only got re-issued on CD. On 28th April 2009 Ryko’s licence expired and the band took back all their rights to the recordings and conseuqently the albums finally got the long-awaited vinyl reissues on Damon &amp; Naomi’s 20-20-20 records. The albums were remastered for vinyl by Alan Douches and Kramer (the CDs issued at the same time used Ryko’s 1996 remasters).</p>

<p>My copies were sent to me as a gift by Damon after I enquired about whether they were bringing any copies over on the upcoming Damon &amp; Naomi UK tour - they weren’t but he popped all three in the post! They were simultaneously released in the UK on Domino.</p>

<p>They were also released as lossless digital downloads available from an online shop with the domain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090823043044/http://fierybreeze.com/">fierybreeze.com</a> which is also published on the back of the sleeves - and is on the sleeves of the recent coloured vinyl reissues. Someone however has let that domain expire and it now hosts something a little less reputable. <em>I’ve linked to the site from 2009 in the Wayback Machine to save your eyes from a noisy gambling site.</em></p>
