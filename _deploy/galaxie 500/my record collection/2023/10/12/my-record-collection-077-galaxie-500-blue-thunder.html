    <p>Blue Thunder was Galaxie 500’s second single and contains the love-it-or-hate-it <em>w/sax</em> version of the title track. I fall very heavily on the <strong>love</strong> side!</p>

<p>Now, saxophones in rock are invariably a bad idea but the late Ralph Carney’s two contributions to Galaxie 500’s oeuvre are so unconventional that they don’t really fall into the <em>saxophones in rock</em> category… although, that didn’t stop The Onion (AV Club) from adding it to a list of <a href="https://www.avclub.com/dont-blow-it-10-great-songs-nearly-ruined-by-saxophone-1798212377">10 Great Songs Nearly Ruined By Saxophone</a> in 2007.</p>

<p>But, where do you stand?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The warning is right there in the title. “Blue Thunder” is a magnificent example of the evils of saxophone, because both versions—with and without—are readily available. One is a majestic precursor to the slowcore movement, ambling along gently. The other is like a bucket of cold water dumped on an unsuspecting dreamer.</p>

<p>In 1999 I reminisced about my first listen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the sax on the single version scared the living shit out of me first time I listened to it - I had my headphones on and it was turned up really loud and all of a sudden there was this screeching wail - I jumped out of my skin - here was me expecting some nice mild barely-audible tootling and instead I got that!</p>

<p>Here are a few extracts from opinions posted to the mailing list over the years…</p>

<!--more-->

<blockquote>
  <p>the sax sounds violent and makes me angry, which is completely the opposite of how every other Galaxie song sounds and makes me feel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="blockquote-footer text-end">Nate - The Galaxie 500 Mailing List</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it was a shock to hear this racket over the top of such a beautiful song. After two or three listens I was absolutely entranced by it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="blockquote-footer text-end">Andy - The Galaxie 500 Mailing List</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the saxophone in Blue Thunder is too obnoxious for my tastes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="blockquote-footer text-end">Michael - The Galaxie 500 Mailing List</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>while I agree the sax is contrary to the song I think this is the beauty of it. It is very harsh, angry even, but then I see it as an outpouring of what is more often reined in. Outwardly intense where G500 are normally inwardly intense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="blockquote-footer text-end">Andy - The Galaxie 500 Mailing List</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you know i’ve always liked the sax version.  it just seems to ‘work.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="blockquote-footer text-end">Jan - The Galaxie 500 Mailing List</p>

<p>In his review of the single in Melody Maker Everett True had this to say about the sax:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a wired saxophone which bursts in just when you don’t need it, silence so full of wailing noise as to make you shiver with awe every time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="blockquote-footer text-end">Blue Thunder review (Melody Maker, January 1990)</p>

<p>In 2011 Everett revisited his review and had this to add:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sax just confused the hell out of me. Still does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always loved Ralph Carney’s contribution to the Galaxie 500 oral history:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kramer was recording them and asked me if I wanted to play sax on a tune or two. I said yes. I went to his studio. They were there; they were nice and shy. I played. They liked; it ended up on record– that is the end of the story.</p>

<p>I still pick the <em>w/sax</em> version as my go-to <em>Blue Thunder</em>.</p>

<p>So, which side of the fence do you fall?</p>

<p>So the votes are in after 24 hours and… it’s a close run thing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blue Thunder (w/sax) <strong>33</strong></li>
  <li>Blue Thunder <strong>28</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>combined results from the form and Instagram</em></p>

<p>The <em>withouts</em> comments were emphatcic!</p>

<ul>
  <li>I find it utterly unlistenable</li>
  <li>Because it replaces the guitar. Goes over the guitar. Never any need for a sax solo.</li>
  <li>It has always sounded like someone playing over a finished song, rather than as part of it.</li>
  <li>80s saxaphone recordings are universally terrible and even Galaxie couldn’t fix it</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>withs</em> generally couldn’t explain why!</p>

<ul>
  <li>I cant explain it. I usually hate sax as much as the next guy.</li>
  <li>Impossible for me to articulate. But it is!</li>
  <li>I’m normally anti-sax but this just works.</li>
</ul>

<p>There were also a mix of similar responses on Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p>It’s pretty close - but we have to have a winner:</p>

<p>I bought this on release… during my vinyl &gt; CD transition I’d still invariably buy singles on vinyl - I bought very few CD singles, suspect those horrendous thin jewel cases contributed to me holding out!</p>

<p>Obviously (one of) the greatest cover versions of all time is on the flip… I’ll probably come to that later in the series! Actually… there are <em>two</em> great covers on this!</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Catalogue Number:</em> AHFOW 12/0036</li>
  <li><em>Artist:</em> Galaxie 500</li>
  <li><em>Title:</em> Blue Thunder / Victory Garden / Ceremony / Cold Night</li>
  <li><em>Format:</em> 12”</li>
  <li>Bought for whatever singles cost - probably in Rough Trade.</li>
  <li><a href="https://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/album/uncollected">You can find Blue Thunder (w/sax) on ‘Uncollected’ on Bandcamp</a> and the other tracks are sprinkled around <a href="https://galaxie500.bandcamp.com">their Bandcamp</a>.</li>
