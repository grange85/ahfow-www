<p>Weirdly this is actually difficult to listen to and that’s because poor Dean’s throat was clearly not fit for the show - Snowstorm is quite early in the set so isn’t too bad, but by the time we get to Pictures it’s hard not to wince every time he reaches for a note his throat can’t manage. But what a trooper!</p>

<p>Snowstorm is my favourite Galaxie 500 song, no question. For most bands, the song of theirs I love most varies with my mood, but with Galaxie 500 it’s always Snowstorm - <a href="/2019/10/05/on-fire-30-side-1-track-3-snowstorm/">I’ve speculated before why that might be</a>.</p>

<p>The sleeve contains two shots from Macioce’s first photoshoot with Galaxie 500:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Macioce: The first time we did a photo shoot, we went to a park in Queens. I had them walk into the trees; I was thinking of an ELP record, Trilogy I used color infrared film for a ’60s psychedelic feel. After the film came back we met up at Noise New York on Walker Street. We were in the studio when I showed them the pictures. They were so polite, very respectful of us, being a bit older, and I think they were not crazy about the shots.</p>

  <p>Kramer said, “Look at them! You look like Ten Years After!” And Galaxie stared back blankly. “Ten Years After!” Kramer said again. I looked from face to face. “Ten Years After? Woodstock?” That may have been the first time I realized I was now older than the bands I photographed. They didn’t use the picture for an album, but Kramer made a shirt from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="blockquote-footer text-end">Temperature’s Rising: Galaxie 500, an oral and visual history (Yeti, 2012)</p>

<p>I think that is one of my favourite quotes in the book …</p>

<p>… also I think <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZSJzHFFMkQ/">that photoshoot</a> is my favourite of Galaxie 500! That and the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CeECYKFOrfW/?img_index=1">Unisphere one</a>.</p>

<p>A few years back Naomi sent me one of the T-shirts Macioce mentioned and said “you should just have fun with it and wear it even if it self-destructs” but I <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/53137337736/in/album-72157619400404262/">put it on once for a photo</a> and then filed it - I’ve been saving it for a special occasion - I’m not convinced any occasion will be special enough though!</p>
