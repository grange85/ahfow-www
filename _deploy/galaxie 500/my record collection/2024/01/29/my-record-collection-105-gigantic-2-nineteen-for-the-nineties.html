<p>… and others, less impressive, but most not much… less… er! Just a couple of turds (See See Rider and Pussy Galore).</p>

<p>The myth of the longevity and indestrictibiliy of the CD format took many hits over the years - one of those was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc_bronzing">CD bronzing</a> where the discs would discolour and eventually become unplayable. This mostly affected discs manufactured by PDO in Blackburn. The Melody Maker CD of Gigantic 2 was affected by this fault.</p>

<p>This issue was brought to light in 1994 and the manufacturer admitted that it was a fault of theirs and agreed to replace discs. As a public service to Galaxie 500 fans I posted the information on how to replace discs to the web site and the mailing list (and the <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/archive/1996-06-27-galaxie-500-mailing-list-mini-faq.txt">Galaxie 500 miniFAQ - see Q5</a>), as follows:</p>

<blockquote start="3">
  <ol>
    <li>Why is my Gigantic! 2 CD changing colour?
 A number of faulty CDs were pressed by a company called PDO during the late 80s and early 90s (including Gigantic! 2). A decaying CD will become bronze tinged, and will eventually begin to lose sound quality.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>PDO have a policy of replacing these deteriorating CDs free of charge.</p>

<p class="blockquote-footer text-end">A Head Full of Wishes (miniFaq</p>

<p>You were obliged to return the faulty disc and provide proof of purchase (although, having the disc is surely proof of purchase). I duly sent off my faulty CD 9keeping the sleeve, and waited. And waited, and waited. I did start to worry that I’d seen the last of my CD but eventually the replacement arrived as promised.</p>

<p>According to the Wikipedia article the company changed hands shortly after and stopped offering replacements.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how many other folk followed the instructions to get a replacement CD but I’d guess not too many - so I probably have one of the very few CD copies of Gigantic! 2 that is <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-mm-gigantic-2-silver.jpg">still silver</a>, otherwise <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-mm-gigantic-2-bronzed.jpg">this is what it would have looked like</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately… it is sadly more unplayable than all those bronzed discs since it has a crack… no idea how that happened, but it has rendered it useless. I have a CDR not entirely sure when I made this - I guess either before it cracked (but why!?) or before I sent it away (but how!? Not sure I was ripping CDs as early as 1996). But thankfully, I do have a copy.</p>
