    <p>Dean &amp; Britta arrived on this side of the pond with just drummer Jason Lawrence meaning that they'd be performing the songs of Galaxie 500 in the format of Galaxie 500 - as a three piece. The first show was at The Workman's Club in Dublin on Friday night...</p>
<ul>
<li>There was a <a href="http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/day-and-night/qampa-galaxie-500s-dean-wareham-2535868.html">short Q&amp;A interview in the Irish Independent</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Next stop was Stereo in Glasgow</p>
<ul>
<li>Spools Paradise <a href="http://spoolsparadise.blogspot.com/2011/02/i-feel-alright-when-you-smile.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=facebook">has a review</a> "From the second Wareham came on stage the scene was set for an old friend coming home" </li>
<li>There's some video clips of Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste and Listen, the Snow Is Falling</li>

<p>Then on to the Leeds <del datetime="2011-02-15T13:42:17+00:00"><em>(not found any links yet - <a href="mailto:andy@grange85.co.uk">email me</a> any reviews, pics or videos)</em></del></p>
<p><ins datetime="2011-02-15T13:45:19+00:00">
<ul>
<li>Fisherman's Jive Arse Slippers has a short but sweet review saying that they "capture the concentration of the [...] crowd with their Velvet Underground influenced dreamy pop with simplicity and minimalistic pop songs"</li>
<ul>&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<p>And last night at The Ruby Lounge in Manchester:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folly of Youth has a <a href="http://follyfollyfolly.blogspot.com/2011/02/dean-wareham-plays-galaxie-500-ruby.html">bittersweet review</a> along with some videos (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ1-E6DbTt8&amp;feature=mfu_in_order&amp;list=UL">Strange</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYmF0y1phDI&amp;feature=player_embedded">Tugboat</a>), pictures and a <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eF8eqGDuqsw/TVnDRD-vB5I/AAAAAAAADCA/f4DtDAI1-QI/s1600/Dean%2BWareham%2Bplays%2BGalaxie%2B500%2B039.JPG" class="flower_imagebox">snap of the setlist</a>.</li>
<li>mrjaytaylor tweeted a couple of live audio clips from the venue - <a href="http://audioboo.fm/boos/278176-the-inimitable-dean-wareham-playing-galaxie-500-the-ruby-lounge">Snowstorm</a> and <a href="http://audioboo.fm/boos/278195-more-dean-wareham-playing-galaxie-500-therubylounge">Tugboat</a></li>
