    <p>Cagney &amp; Lacee was Dean Wareham’s first foray into releasing a record full of covers with his wife (ok… so his next foray, with a different wife, was only <em>half</em> full of covers). Like with the <a href="/2023/04/06/my-record-collection-023-cagney-lacee-time-by-the-way/">first Cagney &amp; Lacee release</a> it doesn’t bother mentioning on the sleeve who Cagney or Lacee is.</p>

<div class="text-center"><figure class="figure w-100"><img src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/cagney-and-lacee-six-feet.jpg" class="figure-image img-fluid rounded mx-auto" alt="Cagney &amp; Lacee - Six Feet of Chain" /><figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Cagney &amp; Lacee - Six Feet of Chain</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>The sleeve was however augmented with an orange sticker that declared that it was “an album of cover versions lovingly performed by Dean Wareham and Claudia Silver”.</p>

<p>Cagney is credited with <em>instruments</em> and is Dean (who also produced the album); Lacee, credited with <em>vocals</em>, is Claudia Silver, Dean’s wife (at the time).</p>

<p>I wrote about all the covers in my <a href="/category/originals/">Originals series</a> a few years ago - you’ll probably find mp3s of most tracks too. But, if you can’t be arsed reading those posts here are a few snippets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It says <a href="/2013/02/27/originals-yours-tonight-by-martin-rev-covered-by-cagney-and-lacee/">Be Mine</a> on the sleeve, but is actually a cover of a different track called <em>Yours Tonight</em> - both tracks are from Martin Rev’s solo album <em>See Me Ridin’</em>.</li>
  <li><a href="/2014/01/08/originals-lovin-you-by-minnie-riperton-covered-by-cagney-and-lacee/">Lovin’ You</a> - a cover of the wonderful Minnie Riperton song. Minnie had previously been in the Rotary Connection, and before that a receptionist at Chess Records.</li>
  <li><a href="/2014/04/30/originals-six-feet-of-chain-by-lee-hazlewood-covered-by-cagney-lacee/">Six Feet of Chain</a> - the first of two Lee Hazlewood songs and leaves off Lee’s pre-song preamble that tells the story of two brothers who steal from each other and get each other arrested and jailed.</li>
  <li>It says <a href="/2013/11/20/originals-the-beginning-of-goodbye-by-marty-robbins-covered-by-cagney-and-lacee/">The Last Goodbye</a> on the sleeve, but is actually a song called <em>The Beginning of Goodbye</em> by Marty Robbins - so… two mistakes in song titles on the album!?</li>
  <li><a href="/2013/03/27/originals-by-the-way-i-still-love-you-by-nancy-sinatra-covered-by-cagney-and-lacee/">By The Way (I Still Love You)</a> has the parenthesised part of the title left off on the sleeve - it is included on the <a href="/2023/04/06/my-record-collection-023-cagney-lacee-time-by-the-way/">single</a> so we’ll call this an aesthetic decision rather than <em>another</em> mistake! This is the second Lee Hazlewood song.</li>
  <li><a href="/2013/07/10/originals-greyhound-goin-somewhere-by-bobbie-gentry-covered-by-cagney-and-lacee/">Greyhound Goin’ Somewhere</a> - was written for the wonderful Bobbie Gentry by Michael Martin Murph(e)y and Bill Dorsey and is on her 1969 album <em>Touch ‘Em With Love</em>.</li>
  <li><a href="/2013/06/26/originals-for-the-sake-of-the-children-by-henry-gibson-covered-by-cagney-and-lacee/">For The Sake of The Children</a> is the first of two songs from the great Robert Altman film <em>Nashville</em> and was originally sung by Laugh-in poet, and leader of the Illinois Nazis Henry Gibson… <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu-0HDBJHc8">I hate Illinois Nazis</a></em>.</li>
  <li><a href="/2013/08/08/originals-memphis-by-karen-black-covered-by-cagney-and-lacee/">Memphis</a> - also from <em>Nashville</em> and written and sung by, sadly missed, Karen Black. Cagney &amp; Lacee’s version opens with a bit of dialogue lifted from the film.</li>
  <li><a href="/2013/09/18/originals-im-not-sayin-by-gordon-lightfoot-covered-by-cagney-and-lacee/">I’m Not Sayin’</a> was written and first recorded by Gordon Lightfoot - and then covered by Nico before she got entangled in the VU.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sleeve was designed by Laurie Henzel and has some uncredited comic art that I have never managed to track down the source of.</p>
