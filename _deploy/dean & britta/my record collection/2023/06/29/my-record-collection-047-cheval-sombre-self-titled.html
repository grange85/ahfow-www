    <p>I first heard of Cheval Sombre in September 2008 when Dean emailed me to tell me that Britta had remixed a track for a single by “our friend who goes by the name of Cheval Sombre” on Irish label Trensmat. Britta’s remix of I Sleep was on the CD that was tucked in with the 7” single. The following year Dean &amp; Britta’s <em>Double Feature Records</em> released this, Cheval Sombre’s first full length LP. And it’s a beauty.</p>

<p>My copy, as you can see, is still in it’s shrink-wrap - that’s because Dean had sent me a promo copy before release, which I had listened to a lot.</p>

<p>A few months after release Dean &amp; Britta played a show at St Giles’ Church in London with Cheval Sombre supporting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I arrived shortly before Cheval Sombre took to the stage, hooked up with David and settled down in a pew with as good a view as we could expect at this late stage. Cheval Sombre played seated, accompanied by a seated Sonic Boom. I think Britta (who accompanied them) may have been standing… but she was standing behind the PA (except when she sat behind the drums). Dean played guitar on a couple of songs and stood… in my eye line. But I never <strong>saw</strong> too much of the set</p>

<p>I have quite the history of seeing, yet not seeing Cheval Sombre gigs… <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/8209836725/in/album-72157632080412568/">even from the front row</a>!</p>
