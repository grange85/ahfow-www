    <p>For a while in the early years of the century, my regular gig going partner was a taper. He mostly taped Van Morrison and Dylan shows but he liked to get practice in so I’d have him practicing at slightly smaller venues. This is a DAT of his recording of Dean &amp; Britta’s second ever London show, put on at The Legion by Sonic Cathedral in June 2007.</p>

<p>This was a taper used to working undercover so it involved smuggling the recorder, in and attaching the mics to his specs. This was all part of the practice.</p>

<p>My pal only taped the last two bands, but the first two were pretty great too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flowers of Hell opened - made a very lovely noise, eight people and lots and lots of instruments!</li>
  <li>La Volume Courbe were next up - made a sweet noise, had Mel Draisey (then of The Clientele) play with them, and did a clunky cover of Elizabeth Cotton’s Freight Train.</li>
  <li>The Clientele played a very short but good set full of Alasdair’s miserable between songs banter - I think he may be taking “curmudgeon” and “sarcastic” evening classes because he’s getting very good at it. I was seeing The Clientele at every opportunity so them supporting Dean &amp; Britta was an absolute treat…</li>
</ul>

<p>… although, <strong>I</strong> wasn’t shouting for an encore!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Last westbound Central Line from Liverpool St = 00:22</li>
  <li>Brisk walk from The Legion to Liverpool St = 20 minutes</li>
  <li>Dean &amp; Britta onstage = 23:00</li>
</ul>

<p>It was looking like an hour was the most Dean &amp; Britta I was going to get.</p>

<p>It was a fab show, Sonic Boom set up his gadgets on the side of the stage and helped out for a couple of numbers. They encored with Bonnie and Clyde and the lights came up at 00:02, we belted to the station and arrived on the platform with one minute to spare.</p>

<p>Squeezing four bands onto a bill on a Wednesday evening on the wrong side of London was a little inconsiderate IMO!</p>
