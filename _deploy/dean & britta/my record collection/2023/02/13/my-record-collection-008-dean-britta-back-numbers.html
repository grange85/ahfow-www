    <p>This is an advance/promo copy of Dean &amp; Britta’s second album “Back Numbers” that Dean sent me back in January 2007 - the front sleeve artwork is the same as the released version except it has ADVANCE CD printed on it. Everything else is more… sparse. Obviously the music is as splendid as you’d expect.</p>

<p>This was the start of the whole <em>Turn vs Turned</em> headache… on the sleeve of this CD track 4 is <em>You Turn My Head Around</em> - on the official release it is <em>You Turn<strong>ed</strong> My Head Around</em> - this seemingly random interchanging of titles continued, and irked me considerably, to the point where Dean emailed me to explain…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Andy,</p>

  <p>my attention has been called to the discrepancy on the title of that 
song. There was in fact some back and forth with the label over this 
too when we were doing the artwork.</p>

  <p>My original 7” single calls the song “You Turned My Head Around”, 
which is how it is registered with the songwriting society also, so 
that’s what I went with for our CD.</p>

  <p>But on the Lee Hazlewood CD “The Cowboy and the Lady” (the song was 
not on the original vinyl release of that album, but was added as a 
bonus to the CD) it is listed as “You Turn”.</p>

  <p>My set lists are all about laziness, so don’t go by those.</p>

  <p>best,
Dean</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This site has stuck very rigidly by <em>Turned</em> - to the point where it’s even included in the <a href="/about/style-guide/">AHFoW style guide</a> <em>(yep - there really is one - I do welcome submissions if anyone fancies writing something - as long as they follow the style guide!)</em></p>
