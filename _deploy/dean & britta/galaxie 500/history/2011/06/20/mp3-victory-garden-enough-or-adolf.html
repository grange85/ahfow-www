<meta name="description" content="In the early days of A Head Full of Wishes in 1994/5, in a rush to load the site up with content I made use of lots of other people. I scoured the internet and copied and leeched, I put out pleas on the mailing list and in newsgroups for anything that could find that would make my site better. In those days it wasn&#39;t the simple matter of feeding at the breast of Google - finding stuff took a bit of an effort. I lifted some of the Galaxie 500 info from the web&#39;s first Galaxie 500 page (Thanks Paul! Wayback machine link) and actually found a guy on Fidonet who scanned in some sleeves for me in exchange for a box of used floppy discs! Someone, long since lost in the mists of time, had transcribed all of Galaxie 500&#39;s (and Luna&#39;s) lyrics - I&#39;m not sure whether these were already out there or if they were sent to me but they ended up on my website... being the lazy bugger I am I didn&#39;t check them, I just published and left them there. In amongst these lyrics were those of The Red Crayola&#39;s Victory Garden, incorrectly transcribed, and possibly appearing to be &quot;cleaned up&quot; - the actual lyric &quot;Oh Adolf, I know the serious virgin does adore you&quot; had become &quot;Oh enough, I know the serious fortune does adore you&quot; Over time lyrics became a valuable commodity on the Internet and my site was duly scoured and it&#39;s content copied to a billion hateful lyrics sites... mistakes and all. Flash forward to September 2008 and an email arrived in my mailbox from Dean Wareham asking me to fix things I just spoke to Mayo Thompson of the Red Crayola, who bitched at me for getting a crucial lyric wrong (one where he mentions &quot;Adolf&quot;)... but as it turns out I always had the lyric right, that was always what I sang, but wherever they come up on the internet, they are incorrectly transcribed, maybe because people can&#39;t actually believe that he says &quot;Adolf&quot;? Of course I fixed the lyrics on A Head Full of Wishes but of course there was no way those worms were going to find their way back into the can. I&#39;m sorry Mayo (and Dean) but you&#39;ll never get rid of enough. Dean &amp; Britta played Victory Garden at last Friday&#39;s show at The Bell House in Brooklyn - and Dean told the story of his call from Mayo Thompson... he didn&#39;t name me but I feel a bit responsible. OK, that was a better blog post in my head... but if you made it this far - here&#39;s an mp3 of last Friday&#39;s perfromance...
