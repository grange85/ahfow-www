It made me realize I probably should’ve been playing more of these songs all along [...] but I didn&#39;t want Luna playing songs of my old band and it didn’t really occur to me to do an entire set of Galaxie 500 material until the promoter asked for it this year. But as we rehearsed the set for that one show, I realized that these songs still sound pretty good. I found my voice can still hit those high notes. And I figured if I don&#39;t do this now, then when?
