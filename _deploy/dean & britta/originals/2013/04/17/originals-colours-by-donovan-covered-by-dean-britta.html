<meta name="description" content="When I bought my first guitar - and cheap Washburn acoustic, I got given a book of easy guitar songs and the first song in the book, and therefore the first song I ever played on the guitar was Donovan&#39;s Colours - close to 40 years on I&#39;ve probably not yet mastered it (or indeed anything on the guitar). Donovan released Colours as a single in February 1965 and it reached No 4 in the UK charts and has been a staple of his act and covered by pretty much everyone. Here&#39;s Donovan&#39;s single and a couple of other versions... including Dean &amp; Britta&#39;s which turned up on their single of Words You Used to Say in 2006.
