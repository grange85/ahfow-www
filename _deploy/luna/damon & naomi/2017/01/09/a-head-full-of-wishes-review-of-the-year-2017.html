<h2>October</h2>
<p>Video of Luna covering Mot&ouml;rhead appeared on A.V. Club Undercover - and rocked my world!

<p>November was quiet so I idly started picking my <a href="/category/favourite-galaxie-500-covers/">favourite Galaxie 500 covers</a> (that's other people covering Galaxie 500 not Galaxie 500 covering other people!)</p>

<h2>December</h2>
<p>Damon &amp; Naomi released a digital album of rarities and  decided to put the whole of their back-catalogue onto Bandcamp for pay what you want - and it turned out to be a great success.</p>

<p>&hellip; and thanks to the <a href="https://archive.org/donate/">Internet Archive</a> Wayback Machine <a href="/2016/12/20/my-favourite-galaxie-500-covers-7-rainer-maria-hearing-voices/">I found a video I thought I'd lost forever</a>.</p>

<h2>&hellip; and on to 2017!</h2>
<p>And that was it - another busy year - thanks to Dean and Damon &amp; Naomi for keeping on doing amazing things and keeping me in a near full time hobby. Thanks to all the brilliant fans who I'm proud to be one of - who make being fans of Galaxie 500, Luna and Damon &amp; Naomi (&amp;c.) a wonderful thing to be a part of.</p>
<p>2017 will see Damon's book, hopefully the much hinted at Luna covers album and/or Dean's album of "cowboy songs" with Cheval Sombre. And with any luck more gigs to go to and fans to hang with.</p>
<p>It's been a blast - thank you all so much!</p>
