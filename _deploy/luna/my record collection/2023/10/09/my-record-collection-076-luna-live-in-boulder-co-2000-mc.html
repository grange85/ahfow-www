<p>During my metal phase I had literally hundreds of bootleg cassettes - mostly bought at markets and record fairs around London. Often recordings of gigs I was at that would often hit the markets the weekend after the show. Sadly all of those went AWOL in a move (something else I keep dreaming will turn up again).</p>

<!--more-->

<p>But by the time I became a Galaxie 500 fan I’d stopped that. Maybe because I just didn’t go to where they were being sold any more. I also think I digitised and ditched a lot of the ones I did acquire over time so there are very few cassettes in my collection, so the ones that are are a bit of a mystery. Why do I have this? Why did I keep it? It’s a middling audience recording from Britta’s early days but I don’t have it digitised… and to be honest decided it wasn’t worth my time to bother. I have lots of better recordings so, here’s Fuzzy Wuzzy from The Bowery Ballroom a few days later.</p>
