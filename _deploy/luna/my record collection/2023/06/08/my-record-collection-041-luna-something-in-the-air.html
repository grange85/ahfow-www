    <p>Luna’s cover of Thunderclap Newman’s <em>Something in the Air</em> was released as part of Sonic Cathedral’s singles club in 2019, I <a href="/luna/my%20record%20collection/2023/05/11/my-record-collection-033-luna-something-in-the-air.html">wrote about the test pressing</a> that Nat sent me earlier and suggested I had “plenty to write about the single” that would wait for this post… not sure whether the post will live up to that tease… but here goes.</p>

<div class="text-center"><figure class="figure w-100"><img src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/luna-something-in-the-air-sonic-cathedral.jpg" class="figure-image img-fluid rounded mx-auto" alt="Luna - Something in The Air" /><figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Luna - Something in The Air</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Some random <em>facts</em> related to this single coming… as they pop into my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Something in the Air was written by Speedy Keen who was born, and lived in Hanwell, a few hundred yards from where I lived, for a long time… although not sure if he lived there while I did. I never, knowingly, bumped into him. There is no blue plaque to him - I think there ought to be. He also produced Motorhead’s first album.</li>
  <li>Subscribers to the Sonic Cathedral Singles Club got extra gifts with each release - Luna’s came with a very cool <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2019/06/04/sonic-cathedral-luna-mission-patch/">NASA-like <em>mission</em> patch</a>.</li>
  <li>For a short period I built and ran (for free) the website for a version of Thunderclap Newman - only Andy Newman was still a part of the band, I met him at a gig they played in a bar in West London and he was lovely. The gig wasn’t great and <a href="https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2007/07/02/thunderclap-newman-and-andy-thunderclap-newman/">I wrote as much</a> on my blog… which saw me sacked from my role as Webmaster. I got a slightly ridiculous formal dismissal via a letter.</li>
  <li>The flip side of the single contained <em>The Oort Cloud</em>/<em>Kuiper Belt</em> - two spacey, instrumental improvisations.</li>
  <li>Another member of Thunderclap Newman was Jimmy McCulloch who was later in Wings… and died too young.</li>
  <li>For the launch of the single Sonic Cathedral had a splendid, but sadly sparsely attended, evening at The Social. It included a screening of <a href="">Tell Me Do You Miss Me</a> some excellent live performances by <em>“surprise live bands”</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvXVcXdibFo">Daniel Land</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZZYddaDo2o">Buffalo Postcard and Ben Phillipson</a>) and <em>“special guest DJs”</em> … which was me!</li>
  <li>Here’s the playlist of a <a href="/articles/sonic-cathedral-social-service-playlist/">mix of what I played during that DJ-ing job</a> - I’ve not been asked again!</li>
</ul>
