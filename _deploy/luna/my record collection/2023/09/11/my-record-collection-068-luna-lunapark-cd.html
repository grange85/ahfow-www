<p>The sleeve has a picture of a pencil sharpener,  I know that now, and it doesn’t look like anything else… now. A space age pencil sharpener for sure, but so obviously a pencil sharpener, and so obviously a pencil sticking out of it. When I discovered what it was I felt a bit stupid for all the years it had been a spaceship or a ray gun. I posted it on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fullofwishes/photos/a.124150591490/10157924998001491/?paipv=0&amp;eav=AfZDMHVNWHbaIDbZJRbuhoCWlicJz_f-Ih23a4VRlIEu3zDbXP81BYVsdY5RpcKKLD4">Facebook a couple of years ago</a> and it was quite a relief that a good few comments revealed that I wasn’t alone in my stupidity.</p>

<p>I love Lunapark, sometimes more than any other Luna album. Dean ranked it sixth out of Luna’s (then) seven albums - but his judgement is affected by things that don’t affect that of a fan, and so can’t be trusted!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like some of this record too, but I don’t feel like we were really a band yet. We’d only been a band for a few months and did this album as a trio: myself, Justin Harwood and Stanley Demeski. Grasshopper played on a few songs too. But after that we were always a quartet with two guitar players. So it’s missing Sean Eden.</p>

<p>I’d have bought this album on the day of release (or the weekend after).</p>
