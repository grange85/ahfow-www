    <p>This is a CDR of Lunafied that Dean sent me back in 2006 after some rather unsubtle scrounging on my part!</p>

<p>Lunafied was originally released as a digital only release by Rhino and wasn’t available outside of the US and despite the fact that I already had all the songs on it in some form I wanted a copy so… I wrote to Dean. I hope he doesn’t mind me publishing the email exchange that led me to having this CDR:</p>

Hi Dean,  

I love the "sleeve" of the Lunafied album - particularly as I've been sucked into the pinhole-camera thing of late* so camera-obscura's are very exciting - I keep wanting to turn our bedroom into a camera obscura but Hazel rightly points out that the row of Victorian terraced houses on the opposite side of the road isn't quite the Empire State Building!

Does Lunafied exist as a "real" CD (maybe as a promo???) I'd love to own a proper CD with that sleeve! (sorry for the unsubtle attempted scrounge there!).

Any news on the Beggars covers album?

Have a nice summer,

-=Andy=-

Hi Andy,

the lunafied image is by Abelardo Morell, but perhaps you knew that already. His photos are great.

http://www.abelardomorell.net/

But there is no CD with that image, not even a promo. Rhino wanted it to be exclusive to the iTunes store. They have said that they might get around to releasing it on CD one day, but frankly I don't think it's going to happen. I can burn you a disc of Lunafied (from the master that was prepared).

Beggar's still haven't given me a date, though they suggested it would be September.

Did you get a copy of the Best Of? I can send you one of those too. No new songs, but the package is nice.

happy 4th of July!

Dean

Hi Dean,

&gt; the lunafied image is by Abelardo Morell, but perhaps you knew that already.
&gt; His photos are great.

I was looking at his other photos on his website yesterday - they are great

&gt; But there is no CD with that image, not even a promo. Rhino wanted it to be
&gt; exclusive to the iTunes store. They have said that they might get around to
&gt; releasing it on CD one day, but frankly I don't think it's going to happen.
&gt; I can burn you a disc of Lunafied (from the master that was prepared).

I would love that if it's not too much bother.

&gt; Beggar's still haven't given me a date, though they suggested it would be
&gt; September.

I'm looking forward to that - it's all the more frustrating because Europeans can't buy from the US iTunes (or from the Rhino site) I've had half a dozen email from folk trying to get hold of it...

&gt; Did you get a copy of the Best Of? I can send you one of those too. No new
&gt; songs, but the package is nice.

Thanks but I've ordered a copy (although it hasn't arrived yet).

Thanks a lot - enjoy the fireworks!

You tell them that good things come to those who wait... the Beggar's version will have 17 covers (including "Sweet Child O' Mine" and  "Only Women Bleed" and "Jealous Guy", which are not on the iTunes album).
I'll put it in the mail asap.

<p>The CDR arrived a week or so later - with a postcard dated 4th of July - so… all in one day. It contained the 17 track Beggars Banquet version of Lunafied so the extra tracks Dean mentions, plus Neon Lights, but is missing Fly Into The Mystery and Happy New Year from the Rhino/iTunes version.</p>
