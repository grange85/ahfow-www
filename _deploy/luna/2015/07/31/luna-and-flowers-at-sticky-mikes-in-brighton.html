<meta name="description" content="Wednesday evening sitting in a holiday cottage in Derbyshire with one full day of our holiday left. &quot;What shall we do tomorrow?&quot; asks Hazel. &quot;Well&quot; I reply hesitantly, &quot;we could go home and then I could go and see Luna in Brighton?&quot; My long-suffering partner rolled her eyes. &quot;How long have you been waiting to suggest that?&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve only just thought about it now&quot; I lied. So, we packed up and on Thursday morning we drove down to London, I dropped of Hazel (she gets to see Luna in Leeds on Saturday) then picked up a pal and we headed down to Brighton for Luna&#39;s first UK show since an amazing night at ULU in January 2005. We arrived in Brighton after a long, long drive mostly spent crawling around the M25. Grabbed a bite to eat and headed off to Sticky Mike&#39;s Frog Bar in time to catch most of the always spellbinding Flowers beautiful set. Sticky Mike&#39;s is a dingy basement club with a low ceiling and black painted walls - it&#39;s what all venues were like in the 80s - oddly shaped and with a low stage which, while making viewing a little tricky it made for a particularly intense atmosphere. Luna arrived on stage and once the missing setlists were located and positioned at the base of mic stands and drum kit, they played a nicely mixed up set. Every track a gem - the band were relaxed and clearly enjoying playing together. Bewitched was beautiful, there&#39;s something very special about being in a room full of Luna fans because my online life tends to keep them at a distance. But to hear folk around me singing along to Bewitched almost brought me to tears. The set was nicely mixed up and finished with a storming Friendly Advice followed by 23 Minutes in Brussels. An encore of a couple of covers, Blue Thunder and then Indian Summer, was a perfect ending. The once (minor) disappointment of their show in Porto in April was that they never played Indian Summer. I know it&#39;s a cover but it is also, oddly, most definitely a Luna song. They played it at the first Luna show I saw in 1992, and the last one in 2005 - and, very possibly, at every one in between. When that eBow hum started last night I new that Luna were back. Show finished - a bit of loitering, then to a bar, and then back to London and in bed by 3am! The pictures are a little ropey - I&#39;m sure others will have better ones. Keep your eyes peeled on Instagram and Flickr. You can now follow Luna on Twitter (as well as Instagram and Facebook). London tonight - if you&#39;re nearby and haven&#39;t made up your mind this is one you&#39;d be silly to miss!" />

<p>Wednesday evening sitting in a holiday cottage in Derbyshire with one full day of our holiday left. </p>
<p>"What shall we do tomorrow?" asks Hazel. </p>
<p>"Well" I reply hesitantly, "we could go home and then I could go and see Luna in Brighton?" </p>
<p>My long-suffering partner rolled her eyes. "How long have you been waiting to suggest that?" </p>
<p>"I've only just thought about it now" I lied.</p>
<p>So, we packed up and on Thursday morning we drove down to London, I dropped of Hazel (she gets to see <a href="/database/luna/shows/2015/2015-08-01-luna-brudenell-social-club-leeds-uk">Luna in Leeds on Saturday</a>) then picked up a pal and we headed down to Brighton for Luna's first UK show since an <a href="/database/luna/shows/2005/2005-01-17-luna-ulu-london-uk">amazing night at ULU in January 2005</a>.</p>
<p>We arrived in Brighton after a long, long drive mostly spent crawling around the M25. Grabbed a bite to eat and headed off to Sticky Mike's Frog Bar in time to catch most of the always spellbinding <a href="https://www.facebook.com/flowersdomusic">Flowers</a> beautiful set.</p>
