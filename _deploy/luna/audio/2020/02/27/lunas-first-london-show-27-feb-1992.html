<p>OK, I’ve shared this plenty of times before, but what’s the harm in sharing it again - it’s a good memory!</p>

<p>In 1991 Galaxie 500 split. I was heartbroken, and a little baffled. I had no idea of the ins and outs - I only became aware of the true sadness of the split many years later - but the <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/articles/1991-05-04-galaxie-500-split/">brief Melody Maker news item</a> was sad enough and hinted that things were not amicable.</p>

<p>A month or so later Damon &amp; Naomi released the <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/damon-and-naomi/releases/damon-and-naomi-pierre-etoile/">Pierre Etoile 12”</a> and some time after that <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/dean-and-britta/dean-wareham-releases/dean-wareham-anesthesia/">Dean’s Anesthesia 12”</a> arrived - and both started to put my mind at ease. While Galaxie 500 were no more - all three still had something special to offer.</p>

<p>On 27 February 1992 <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/shows/1992/1992-02-27-luna-underworld-london-uk/">Luna played in London at the Underworld</a> (a room in the basement of the World’s End pub in Camden). Ken, Stuart, Graham and myself went along. Arriving with a little trepidation, unsure of what Dean had to offer, and unsure if folk would turn out to see whatever it was.</p>

<p>Now, not many shows stick in my head as clearly as this one - this is what I remember of the evening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One of the support bands (Winterset) had Gina Morris, journalist and one-time Stereolab member, guest on a track. They also distributed free 7” singles - not their own, but some they’d obviously picked up in bulk in a second-hand shop somewhere. After an online reminiscence I was contacted by a member of Winterset - which was nice. You can hear <a href="https://soundcloud.com/winterset">lots of demos of them here</a> and a bit <a href="https://greasepaintpeel.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-comedy-of-errors-winterset-horse-of.html">more info here</a>.</li>
  <li>I had recently acquired a Sony Walkman Pro and this was the first show I taped with it - set-up all wrong, the recording was awful - except for the encore after I fiddled with the settings.</li>
  <li>Grasshopper of Mercury Rev played guitar (this was before Sean joined the band)</li>
  <li>Luna played Beat Happening’s Indian Summer - I was unaware that Dean had a little history with the song so it came as a pleasant surprise!</li>
  <li>Two Galaxie 500 songs!</li>
  <li>I left reassured that things looked like they were going to be just fine.</li>
</ul>
