<meta name="description" content="Luna + Confuse-Ray at Debaser, Stockholm Up early and on a train to Stockholm at 8:15. The train is a treat, comfortable and relaxing and pretty quick - not as quick as flying but so much more comfortable. We left Copenhagen in the rain and arrived in Stockholm to blue skies and blustery winds. It made the city so much easier to love. Checked into the Airbnb, grabbed some food, and filled the afternoon with a visit to Skogskyrkogården (a cemetery). Debaser was on the waterfront, it didn&#39;t have the character of Copenhagen&#39;s venue but it had air and space, it had high ceilings and a high stage. Also, when I arrived, it had almost no punters. Luna + Confuse-Ray at Debaser, Stockholm Confuse-Ray opened the show with punchy guitars, but never really grabbed my attention despite that. The venue slowly started to fill but it didn&#39;t seem like the show was going to pull a crowd. Then, all of a sudden it had. The audience was suddenly decent and enthusuastic and Luna made it worth their while. Tonights surprises was the first live outing for Luna&#39;s cover of Roy Orbison&#39;s California Blue; and a blinding Fuzzy Wuzzy to close the show (thanks to Mike&#39;s efforts).
