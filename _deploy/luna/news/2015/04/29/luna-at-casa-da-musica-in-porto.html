<meta name="description" content="Luna Just home from a rather special few days in Porto, the peak of which was of course Luna&#39;s show at Porto&#39;s Casa da Música - anyone who has followed me on Twitter or Instagram on Sunday (and Monday) will know most of this but... for the rest of you here&#39;s how the day went. Casa da Música 17:00 I managed to wangle ourselves an invite to the soundcheck so Hazel and I arrived at Casa da Música to be welcomed by Britta and Augusto who had been arranging the show. Taken inside - the room was rather splendid space in an astonishing building, chatted to Britta, Sean and Lee before Lee rushed off to get me a rather brilliant gift! I fan-posed with Sean and Britta before they joined Lee on stage for the soundcheck and were joined by Dean shortly afterwards. Luna soundchecking 17:20 The soundcheck had to be over by 6 so that it didn&#39;t interfere with the classical concert in the big room next door - the band played a couple of songs and a few snippets. 18:00 The band headed off to rest and eat and Hazel and I headed into the streets around the venue for a bit of sightseeing. While outside I was recognised by Jerónimo and Joana, of Birds are Indie - who had made this very lovely lo-fi cover of 23 Minutes to celebrate Luna coming to Porto. 19:00 Met up with Luna fans Sara and Ed and headed off to grab a bite to eat - which for vegetarians in Porto is not always that easy - we found a café that obliged us with some omelettes and had a lovely pre-show chat about being fans! 21:00 Doors opened for and we headed into Casa da Musica - found a spot at the front. Dean Wareham 21:30 Luna - the band have been mixing up their setlists quite a lot on this tour - the set was splendid but was tinged with concerns about what I never got to hear - of course if they&#39;d played everything I wanted to hear the show would have been hours longer! Friendly Advice was a treat, and 23 Minutes was astounding... and the rest of the set was faultless - Bobby Peru, Pup Tent, Chinatown, Anesthesia, Still at Home etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiEjkmmoe_g They finished with Bonnie and Clyde... not Indian Summer... I think I missed Indian Summer most - off the top of my head I&#39;m not sure that until Sunday I&#39;d ever seen a Luna show that didn&#39;t include Indian Summer. Sean Eden I&#39;m not complaining - even if sounds a bit like that - it was a treat... and I have London in the summer and they&#39;re sure to play another great set - and miss different things out! Lee Wall Britta Phillips 23:00 It was all over - hung around with other fans while the band patiently signed tickets and postcards and CD sleeves.
