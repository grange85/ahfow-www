<meta name="description" content="Luna - California Blue / Rock Yr Baby Feral Child Records will be shortly releasing two Luna 7&quot; singles. The first is a cover of Roy Orbison&#39;s California Blue and the second is a split single with Cheval Sombre and is a cover of The Velvet Underground&#39;s Lonesome Cowboy Bill. Feral Child appear to be a little shy of the Internet so the best place to watch for news of these releases is the Great Pop Supplement Facebook page. they don&#39;t really &quot;do&quot; the internet, they are a quiet couple who live off the land so to speak. They bake bread, eat lebanese food and keep goats, a donkey and some chickens but always wanted to release some records. They are conducting an experiment whereby you can sell out entire runs of records without having a website or indulging in any social media. fair play to them i say!

<blockquote>they don't really "do" the internet, they are a quiet couple who live off the land so to speak. They bake bread, eat lebanese food and keep goats, a donkey and some chickens but always wanted to release some records. They are conducting an experiment whereby you can sell out entire runs of records without having a website or indulging in any social media. fair play to them i say!
