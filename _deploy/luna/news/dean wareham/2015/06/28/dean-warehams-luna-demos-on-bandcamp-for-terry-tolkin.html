<meta name="description" content="Dean Wareham: Luna Demos 1991 Dean Wareham has just released the recordings he made after leaving Galaxie 500 and before he formed Luna. All proceeds from the release are to help pay for the medical bills of Terry Tolkin: Luna (at this early stage Dean Wareham) was signed to Elektra by A&amp;R man Terry Tolkin who had previously worked at Rough Trade, Touch &amp; Go and Caroline Records. Terry now lives in New Orleans and is gravely ill. He is fighting a rare and aggressive virus that has his doctors perplexed, and facing huge medical bills for hospital visits, thrice-weekly dialysis and prescription drug co-pays. The tracks were recorded at Fun City in NYC in 1991 with the help of Jimmy Chambers of Mercury Rev, and Hamish Kilgore of The Clean. A couple of the tracks previously appeared on Terry&#39;s No.6 records. So for $7 (or more!) you can get a tasty slice of Luna&#39;s history and help out Terry with his debilitating medical bills. Buy Dean Wareham: Luna Demos 1991 on bandcamp. If you prefer there is also a page on Go Fund Me to help out Terry: Help Terry w/ Life-Sustaining Meds!" />
