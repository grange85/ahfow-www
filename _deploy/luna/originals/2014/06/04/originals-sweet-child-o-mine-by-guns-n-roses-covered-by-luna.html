<p>Sweet Child o’ Mine was recorded for Guns N’ Roses 1987 debut album Appetite for Destruction and was their only US number 1 single</p>

<p>Luna recorded the song as a b-side during the sessions for their fifth album The Days of Our Nights but US label at the time insisted they put it on the album. And then dropped the band before releasing it:</p>

<p>Here’s a radio session version from some time in 1999 (I have it listed as January 2000 but Justin is on the recording and had left the band by then so I guess the date is a broadcast date, not the recording date). MP3: <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/audio/luna-sweet-child-world-cafe-1999.mp3">Luna - Sweet Child o’ Mine (World Café 1999)</a></p>
