<p>I’m sure there’ll be plenty of people remembering the events of the 11th September 2001 but since my memories are tied in with Luna I thought I’d just post something here.</p>

<p>On the 1st August 2001 (Dean’s birthday) Luna, then very much a New York band, played a show on the <em>Center Stage at The Twin Towers</em> - just over a month later the world was changed by the events. All the photos in this post are from that show (most, possibly all, by Pablo Chang - if you spot one of yours, uncredited, do shout).</p>

<p>Back then the Galaxie 500 Mailing List was still a fairly vibrant discussion forum, mostly full of Luna fans, many of whom were from NYC so the events that played out in the city on that day were documented somewhat on the mailing list.</p>

<p>One of the active members of the list, Steve, was known to work in WTC2, and all Luna band members lived in the city. While it didn’t need this connection to be affected by the events it did rather bring it home, even to the folk whose home was far away.</p>

<p>Looking through the mailing list archives of that day here are a few of the posts. I hope no one minds me re-posting their words.</p>

  <p>With what I’ve been watching and reading over the last 2/3 hours, and the sickness and fear (for the world as a whole) I feel I just wanted to say that I hope all NYC listmembers are safe.</p>

  <p>I fear the world will not be the same again.</p>

  <p>I recall someone on this list saying they worked in the WTC (around the time that luna played there).  I don’t know this person, but I’ve been thinking about him all day.  I hope he is ok…</p>

  <p>This is truly unbielievable news. As I sat in a Jersey City New Jersey Juror Selection room gazing out the window toward the WTC at a beautiful sunny day I could not believe my eyes. An airplane heading directly toward the towers. Then a cloud of smoke, shock through my whole body. An announcement over the intercom that a plane has just crashed into the WTC. All in the juror selection room had already seem what had been announces. Minutes later 15 or so we see another plane heading toward the building. We were in complete disbelief. As Andy stated the world will not be the same again. Air travel will not be the same. Life as we know it has expired. God I hope that Listmember is safe. Thousands of lives are lost. God help us if there is one.</p>

  <p>regards

  <p>I am a physician at saint vincents hospital in the city, which is the closest trauma hospital to the wtc. I saw the the second building fall from a window here.  Really quite numbing.</p>

  <p>Though it is reassuring to see all the nurses and doctors who came from all over the city to help out.</p>

  <p>I don’t even know what to say. I’m still just speechless. I, too, hope our list member (Steve?) was not there or was one of the lucky ones that got out safely.</p>

  <p>Just wanted to join everybody else in saying, that our list member in the WTC was about the first person I thought about when I saw the live footage, and have been thinking about all day. I hope he is all right. The proportions of this tragedy are unfathomable. Don’t know what else to say.</p>

  <p>Love to one and all.</p>

<p>We finally heard from Steve, I won’t post all his post because it is very personal and quite a hard read - and is the sort of thing I wouldn’t feel happy posting without permission.</p>

  <p>Dear Friends -</p>

  <p>I am alive and well.  As many of you may know, I worked in the WTC Tower 2, 49th floor.  This is the Southeast tower – the second one hit.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>I saw the worse in humanity today, and I also saw the best.  I saw many people helping and comforting others… in countless ways.</p>

  <p>This truly puts all sorts of petty troubles and squabbles in perspective.</p>

  <p>I have hundreds of emails to go through, and I thank you for all your kind thoughts and prayers.</p>

  <p>God Bless - Steve</p>

  <p>Britta’s updated her site with this little snippet of news that we all had probably guessed at anyway but nice to have it confirmed…</p>

  <p>“In response to many recent emails, I am letting everyone know that I am fine and so are Dean, Sean and Lee and, fortunately, all of our friends and family.”</p>

  <p>She also mentions that the bands South American plans are still on although they are obviously dependent on flights happening on-time.</p>
