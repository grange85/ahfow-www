    <p><strong>Luna and after Luna</strong><br />
Well that was a year - Luna finally called it a day with a series of dates at
the Bowery Ballroom in New York City. The band had been touring the US and a
few shows in Europe and Japan since October of 2004. The emotional end came
with a teary rendition of 23 Minutes in Brussels and it was over.</p>

<p>Lee headed off to the US west coast to make music for adverts. His guitar
playing appeared in a series of (European) Levi’s commercials that also
featured an appearance from Britta. He also turned up drumming on the new
album by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051213+/http://www.billricchini.com/">Bill Ricchini</a>. Sean started pulling
together plans for a solo album as well as filling time playing with NYC band
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051213+/http://www.elkcity.net/">Elk City</a></p>

<p>Britta, as well as her appearance in the aforementioned advert (and other work
in advertising) has been working with Dean preparing their second album which
will start recording with producer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051213+/http://www.tonyvisconti.com/">Tony
Visconti</a> in the new year. Dean was also
producing an album for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051213+/http://www.myspace.com/julebrown">Jule Brown</a> which is
a side project of Mark Holland of Jennyanykind.</p>

<p>Also 2005 saw a limited thearical release for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367089/combined">The Squid and The
Whale</a> - the Noah Baumbach film
that featured original music by Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips. A
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AP2ZP8/aheadfullofwi-20">soundtrack
album</a> was
released that featured Dean performing the Pink Floyd track Hey You (as well
as lots of other cool music selected by Noah for the film soundtrack).</p>

<p><strong>Damon &amp; Naomi</strong><br />
2005 saw the release of a fantastic new album by Damon &amp; Naomi. The Earth is
Blue recieved well deserved critical plaudits and the duo expanded themseleves
into a band for dates around North America, Japan and Europe. The album was
released on their own <a href="http://www.20-20-20.com/">20/20/20</a> label after an
amicable split from Sub Pop. They duo also self-released a limited edition DVD
of one of their shows from Japan.</p>

<p><strong>Galaxie 500</strong><br />
The one glaring hole from the Galaxie 500 box set was finally filled this year
when the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BOH93Q/aheadfullofwi-20">Galaxie 500 Peel
Sessions</a>
finally saw the light of day. The two sessions recorded for the legendary John
Peel show had been kicking around as bootlegs for many years but finally got
remastered and recieved a long overdue official release. The album was
released on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051213+/http://www.damonandnaomi.com">Damon &amp; Naomi</a>’s
<a href="http://www.20-20-20.com/">20/20/20</a> label.</p>
