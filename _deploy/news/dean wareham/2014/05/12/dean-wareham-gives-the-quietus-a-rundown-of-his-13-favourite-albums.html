<meta name="description" content="The Quietus has published an article where Dean Wareham runs through his thirteen favourite albums including some of the usual suspects; The Feelies, The Velvet Underground and Lee Hazlewood; along with a couple of surprises. Head over to The Quietus to read the full list. Perfect Prescription was a concept album, the best drug record ever, and they do it without sounding trippy. It&#39;s druggy but it&#39;s not psychedelic; it remains grounded, smooth, groovy. I remember seeing this in a record shop in Boston, must have been 1989, looking at the cover, I think they both have their eyes closed and look like demented English schoolboys.
