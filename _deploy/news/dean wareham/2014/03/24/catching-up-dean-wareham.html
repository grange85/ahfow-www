TVD: I know this is an impossible question, and that’s why I’m asking it. Does Dean Wareham have a favorite Dean Wareham song? DW: Wow. I don’t know. I really like the first single I ever released, “Tugboat.” It’s all been downhill from there. ... and this little tease... A Luna reunion isn’t out of question. That could happen.

Tulip Frenzy gets excited by Dean&#39;s &quot;re-emergence&quot;: Both his prior bands, Galaxie 500 and Luna, have cult followings, and interestingly they don’t completely overlap — those who adored the prior don’t necessarily love the latter, and vice versa.

This past week he released Dean Wareham, his first real solo album, and in and of itself it is worthy of celebration.
