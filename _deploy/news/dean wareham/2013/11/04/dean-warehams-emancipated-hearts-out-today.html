It is also available on CD and orange 10&quot; from Amazon and good record stores such as Norman, Piccadilly, Rough Trade and the new-look Sonic Cathedral Shop. Here are some of the rather lovely reviews that Emancipated Hearts has been getting: &quot;If evidence were required of Lou Reed&#39;s lingering influence, this charming mini-album from the former Galaxie 500 frontman Dean Wareham supplies plenty&quot; - The Independent &quot;It’s stunning how much life (and death) Wareham spreads over these tracks, and makes these tiny whispers of songs feel like the biggest secret anyone’s ever told you&quot; - Pitchfork &quot;Dean Wareham&#39;s first solo album is characteristically refined and intimate, sung in a hymnlike mumble and steeped in the Velvet Underground, classical string drones, synth-pop and country music&quot; - Rolling Stone &quot;There’s rarely a moment over the past 25 years where Dean Wareham’s failed to deliver an album that’s at least three-quarters brilliant, and Emancipated Hearts doesn’t change that record.
