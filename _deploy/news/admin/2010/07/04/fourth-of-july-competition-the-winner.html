<meta name="description" content="And the winner is... Simon Mealor&#39;s song The Fourth of July Still Plays in My Heart. It was lovely to get a musical entry and one that&#39;s been done so well. The excellently reverential backing track and the sweet narrative in the lyrics is just wonderful. Here&#39;s how Simon described it... Inspired by teaching in a French high school in the Normandy countryside in 1991 with only three cassettes to listen to for a year --- ‘On Fire / This is Our Music’ copied off vinyl onto one C90, The Cowboy Junkies’ ‘Trinity Session’ and Rolling Stones’ ‘More Hot Rocks (Big Hits and Fazed Cookies)’. MP3: The Fourth of July Still Plays in My Heart Simon wins a small bunch of CDs and 7&quot; singles including a copy of Luna&#39;s Dear Paulina 7&quot; (with a sleeve!); a copy of the Luna RoundUp promo; a copy of Dean &amp; Britta&#39;s He&#39;s Coming Home 7&quot; and a few other unrelated things I have kicking around. Thanks again to everyone who took the time to enter the competition and I look forward to five entries next year. If you celebrate the Fourth of July have fun, be safe and enjoy the fireworks!" />

<p>Simon Mealor's song The Fourth of July Still Plays in My Heart. It was lovely to get a musical entry and one that's been done so well. The excellently reverential backing track and the sweet narrative in the lyrics is just wonderful. Here's how Simon described it...</p>
