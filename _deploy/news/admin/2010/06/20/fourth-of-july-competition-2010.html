<meta name="description" content="[/captio] Back in 2008 I launched a new competition for art about or inspired by Galaxie 500&#39;s track Fourth of July. The first year was met with embarrassing silence and a grand total of zero entries. For 2009 I decided that the lack of a prize may have contributed to the competition&#39;s pathetic failure and decided to offload some duplicate CDs to the winning entry... and sure enough egged on by some of my off-casts the number of entries soared and the competiton was so fierce that in the end I made both entries winners! So... welcome to year 3 of the AHFoW Fourth of July contest. The winning piece of art will, once again win a collection of crap that I have around that will probably include a couple of CDs and anything else I may be able to rustle up between now and then [prize donors welcome]. The Rules Create a piece of art about or inspired by the Galaxie 500 song Fourth of July so, for example, it could be... Poems about dog biscuits Photos of poems on dog biscuits Photos of small Empire State Buildings... ... or large nickels The lyrics are in the database and the song is in a million places on the internet - go hunt it down... and let your imagination run wild. If entries are so copious that I have to categorise them they will fall into two broad categories... Visual art (e.g. paintings, drawings, photographs, sculptures, videos) Everything else (e.g. poems, stories, songs) The winner will be chosen by me and my family and will be based on a number of criteria, most of which will have more to do with what makes us laugh (or cry) than jaw-dropping artistic-brilliance (although that would be appreciated too of course). It&#39;s just for a laugh so have some fun. Entries in email, or as links to web sites (e.g. blogs/Flickr/YouTube etc.) or in the comments here if you prefer! Competition closes on 3 July and winners will be announced on the 4th." />

<p>Back in 2008 I launched a new competition for art about or inspired by Galaxie 500's track Fourth of July. The first year was met with embarrassing silence and a grand total of zero entries. For 2009 I decided that the lack of a prize may have contributed to the competition's pathetic failure and decided to offload some duplicate CDs to the winning entry... and sure enough egged on by some of my off-casts the number of entries soared and the <a href="/2009/07/04/fourth-of-july-competition-winners/">competiton was so fierce that in the end I made <strong>both entries</strong> winners</a>!</p>
<p>So... welcome to year 3 of the AHFoW Fourth of July contest. The winning piece of art will, once again win a collection of crap that I have around that will probably include a couple of CDs and anything else I may be able to rustle up between now and then [<a href="/2010/06/20/donations-of-competition-prizes-gratefully-received/">prize donors welcome</a>].</p>
<p><strong>The Rules</strong></p>
<p><em>Create a piece of art about or inspired by the Galaxie 500 song Fourth of July</em> so, for example, it could be...</p>
<ul>
<li>Poems about dog biscuits</li>
<li>Photos of poems on dog biscuits</li>
<li>Photos of small Empire State Buildings...</li>
<li>... or large nickels</li>
</ul>
<p>The lyrics are in the database and the song is <a href="http://hypem.com/#/track/856807/Galaxie+500+-+Fourth+Of+July">in a million places</a> <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1bmcs_galaxie-500-4th-of-july_music">on the internet</a> - go hunt it down... and let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p>If entries are so copious that I have to categorise them they will fall into two broad categories...</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual art (e.g. paintings, drawings, photographs, sculptures, videos)</li>
<li>Everything else (e.g. poems, stories, songs)</li>
</ul>
<p>The winner will be chosen by me and my family and will be based on a number of criteria, most of which will have more to do with what makes us laugh (or cry) than jaw-dropping artistic-brilliance (although that would be appreciated too of course). It's just for a laugh so have some fun.</p>
<p>Entries in <a href="mailto:andy@grange85.co.uk">email</a>, or as links to web sites (e.g. blogs/Flickr/YouTube etc.) or in the comments here if you prefer!</p>
<p>Competition closes on 3 July and winners will be announced on the 4th.</p>
