<meta name="description" content="I picked up my copy of Temperature&#39;s Rising: Galaxie 500: an oral and visual history from the PO this morning. It sat on my desk all morning while I worked - grr - so didn&#39;t get a proper look until lunchtime. Here are some idle thoughts: The softback book feels gorgeous. A good size and felt solid and comfortable on my lap as I carefully flicked through it. I mostly looked at the pictures... and there are so many pictures - the book is just bursting with pictures of all sorts of Galaxie 500 ephemera from original art to snaps, from receipts to postcards. I feel very lucky, as a Galaxie 500 fan, at just how well I&#39;ve been treated over the years. This website was born in 1994 when the LPs were out of print. Since then we&#39;ve had a beautiful box set, a live album, a Peel sessions album, a double DVD of live videos, Dean&#39;s autobiography, and now a fabulous book of memories and revelations. The story is beautiful and tragic - I always cry at the end (and at bits in the middle). Honestly, you were never going to get &quot;objective&quot; from me - but surely even the most objective reviewer would find it hard to not be rather pleased at this stunning piece of work!
