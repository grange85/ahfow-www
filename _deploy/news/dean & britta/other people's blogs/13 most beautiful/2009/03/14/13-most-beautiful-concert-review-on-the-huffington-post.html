<meta name="description" content="Photo by Robert Loerzel Robert Loerzel has a good review of one of Dean &amp; Britta&#39;s recent Chicago performances of 13 Most Beautiful in The Huffington Post... At this show, Dean &amp; Britta sounded more like the V.U. than ever. Other than a few loud moments, they stayed on the more delicate end of the V.U. groove, with that trademark sound of tamped-down urgency pulsing underneath the chords. While Wareham and Britta Phillips don&#39;t sound precisely like Lou Reed and Nico when they sing, their languid vocals were a close-enough approximation to set the right mood for the screen tests. Read the full article at The Huffington Post See the photos taken by Robert on Flickr There&#39;s also an in depth review at Venus Zine of the same show and links to a few more of Kirstiecat&#39;s photos (I posted a link to a lovely Kirstiecat picture earlier in the week) &lt;/ins&gt;" />
