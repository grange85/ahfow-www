<meta name="description" content="Baby Jane Holzer brusher her teeth Next Friday sees the premiere of 13 Most Beautiful...Songs for Andy Warhol&#39;s Screen Tests as part of the Pittsburgh International Festival of Firsts. The show features 13 of Andy Warhol&#39;s famous &quot;screen tests&quot; (chosen from the 200 in the Warhol Museum&#39;s archive) including those of Lou Reed, Edie Sedgewick, Nico and Dennis Hopper and will feature Dean &amp; Britta performing a live accompaniment There&#39;s an interview with Dean &amp; Britta about the show in the Pittsburgh City Paper... And so what Dean &amp; Britta will provide are 13 songs, of four minutes each. Most are new compositions, with a few covers thrown in -- a Bob Dylan song and a lesser-known Velvet Underground tune for the Lou Reed film -- and at least one reworking of a Luna tune. While there are no immediate plans to make an album of just these songs, they say they&#39;re sure to re-use at least some of the songs in future releases. And a brief mention in a piece about the festival in the Washington Post... The show gets performed twice at the festival on Friday and Saturday at The Byham Theatre, tickets are available at the festival&#39;s website. Next year the show will visit other venues across the US over the next few months and hopefully will get a DVD release in February. Update: There&#39;s an interview with Dean in the current Pittsburgh Tribune-Review... &quot;I got a call from Ben Harrison, the music curator at the Warhol,&quot; explains Wareham. &quot;I&#39;ve worked with them before -- they were always nice to Luna. Ordinarily, they loan &#39;Screen Tests&#39; to galleries or universities, but not a lot of people have seen them. If you look on YouTube, there&#39;s nothing, which is incredible. So many of these are of famous people -- Bob Dylan, Salvador Dali, Edie Sedgwick.&quot; &lt;/ins&gt;" />
