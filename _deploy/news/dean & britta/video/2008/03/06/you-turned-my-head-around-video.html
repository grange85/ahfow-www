The video is a sweet gem and features Britta cycling (on a very cool looking bike) around singing and looking gorgeous, and Dean on foot (in some very nice shoes) walking around and looking gorgeous. (play on YouTube) My obsessive nature requires me however to be bothered by what the song is called, is it... &quot;You Turned My Head Around&quot; (which is what&#39;s written on the CD, which is what I always thought was being sung, what I put in my database, what this Lee Hazlewood website calls it and what I think Britta sings in the second and third choruses. Or... &quot;You Turn My Head Around&quot; (which is pretty much everywhere else, including in this video, on the Dean &amp; Britta website, Amazon and Musicbrainz (for both the Ann-Margaret and Dean &amp; Britta versions), on Dean&#39;s hand-written setlists and what Britta seems to sing in the first chorus.
