<meta name="description" content="Damon &amp; Naomi have announced dates in the US and Europe for this summer. Come warmer weather, we&#39;ll be hitting the road again. First a US tour together with the new duo of Helena Espvall (Espers) &amp; Masaki Batoh (Ghost), as they promote their debut on Drag City and we all wend our way to Terrastock. Then it&#39;s off to Europe for our first ever shows in Ireland (and Northern Ireland), plus a stop in London (venue tba, but we&#39;re pretty sure it&#39;s happening) as we make our way to a festival appearance in Toulouse, France. A post-Toulouse show in nearby Bordeaux seems to be shaping up. And if there&#39;s no post-Bordeaux show in Paris, well, we&#39;ll just busk outside the Deux Magots like everyone else. Note: all these upcoming shows will be as a straight-ahead duo, though plans are afoot to play at least a couple songs with Batoh and Helena on our tour together. Tour dates and more details can be found on their website." />
