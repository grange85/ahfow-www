<meta name="description" content="Damon &amp; Naomi have just posted their September update on their webpage. Top news is that the vinyl version of the re-release of More Sad Hits is now in stock... But the truth is, back in 1992, it could only sound this good in the studio. The remastering by Alan Douches, and LP cutting by Kevin Gray, do an amazing job of translating the original master tape to both CD and vinyl. Some technological advances you can&#39;t argue with! The duo have also recorded a version of White Christmas for the feature film Lovely, Still... That&#39;s right: White Christmas, the hoariest of hoary holiday clichés. But that Irving Berlin can pack a punch, once you tear those chord changes away from the sleigh bells. Slow it down, and it&#39;s a sad hit! Their email update also mentions some European dates in January" />
