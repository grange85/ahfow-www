<meta name="description" content="Fortune by Damon &amp; Naomi Oh.. I know becuause of the way the modern world works Fortune has been available digitally for weeks and the vinyl has been a bit delayed... but officially Damon &amp; Naomi&#39;s new album was been released today, and it arrives with a lovely (7.0) review in Pitchfork: Using little more than acoustic guitar, keyboards and Krukowski’s jazz-tinged drumming, they have crafted arrangements for these 11 pieces that sound remarkably full-bodied. And it would appear that the natural constraints of the soundtrack form have worked to their advantage. The songs are concise and focused, hitting their melodic or lyrical marks and then quickly moving to the next scene without getting weighted down by repetition or digression. Buy the album as a download from Damon &amp; Naomi&#39;s bandcamp page. Order the album on CD or LP from the shiny new 20-20-20 web page. The album is the soundtrack to Naomi&#39;s short film Fortune which the duo screened with live accompaniment a few times last year. You can watch the whole film on naomivision.com (and below): Fortune from Naomi Yang on Vimeo." />
