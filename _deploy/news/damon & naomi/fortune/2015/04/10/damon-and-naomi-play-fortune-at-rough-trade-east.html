<meta name="description" content="On Thursday I took the day off work to see Damon &amp; Naomi&#39;s lunchtime show at Rough Trade East in London, this was the third and final show of a short UK tour. The shows are in support of their new album Fortune, which was released in February and is the soundtrack to Naomi&#39;s short film of the same name that received its premiere on their last UK tour back in May of last year. We arrived shortly before the start, the small area in front of the stage had filled up quite nicely by the time the duo took to the stage. They opened with a couple of covers - Tim Buckley&#39;s Song to the Siren and Yoko Ono&#39;s Listen, the Snow Is Falling. Damon then introduced the main event - a performance of Fortune - Damon pointed out that the fact that the album is the same length as Pink Moon is no coincidence, and so were to be treated to eleven tracks and 28&#39;22&quot; of music. The film is hypnotic, almost a collection of moving photographs with a story that Damon suggested we may need to build ourselves. The album is beautiful, and works perfectly well without the film, but seeing it accompanying the pictures is certainly special - although maybe standing at the back of a record shop isn&#39;t the perfect venue - although it worked better than you might think. The film finished, the show was over. A nice chat with Naomi afterwards and then headed out into daylight to grab a coffee. You can view the film on Naomivision. You can buy the album on CD or LP from Damon &amp; Naomi&#39;s web store. You can stream and buy a digital copy of Fortune from Damon &amp; Naomi&#39;s bandcamp. There a few more, rather similar, photos over here." />

<p>On Thursday I took the day off work to see Damon &amp; Naomi's lunchtime show at Rough Trade East in London, this was the third and final show of a short UK tour. The shows are in support of their new album Fortune, which was released in February and is the soundtrack to Naomi's short film of the same name that received its <a href="/2014/05/19/damon-and-naomi-at-cafe-oto-18th-may-2014/" title="Damon &amp; Naomi at Café Oto, 18 May 2014">premiere on their last UK tour back in May of last year</a>.</p>
<p>We arrived shortly before the start, the small area in front of the stage had filled up quite nicely by the time the duo took to the stage. They opened with a couple of covers - Tim Buckley's Song to the Siren and Yoko Ono's Listen, the Snow Is Falling. Damon then introduced the main event - a performance of Fortune - Damon pointed out that the fact that the album is the same length as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Moon">Pink Moon</a> is no coincidence, and so were to be treated to eleven tracks and 28'22" of music.</p>
<p>The film is hypnotic, almost a collection of moving photographs with a story that Damon suggested we may need to build ourselves. The album is beautiful, and works perfectly well without the film, but seeing it accompanying the pictures is certainly special - although maybe standing at the back of a record shop isn't the perfect venue - although it worked better than you might think.</p>
<p>The film finished, the show was over. A nice chat with Naomi afterwards and then headed out into daylight to grab a coffee.</p>
