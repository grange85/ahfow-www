<meta name="description" content="In his now blossoming alternate career as a journalist Damon has written an article for Pitchfork discussing how we listen to music in the modern age and an app that tries to take us back to the way we used to listen to it.

Headphones, for all their clarity and detail, leave a blank in the middle of our foreheads. As a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers puts it: &quot;There are large errors in sound position perception associated with headphones, especially for the most important visual direction, out in front…it is very difficult to externalize sounds and avoid the inside-the-head sensation.&quot; Review: The CanOpener App and the Problem of Headphone Listening by Damon Krukowski" />
