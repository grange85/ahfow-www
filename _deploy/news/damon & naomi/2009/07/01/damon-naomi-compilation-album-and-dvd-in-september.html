<meta name="description" content="[/captio] As well as announcing the Galaxie 500 reissues, Damon &amp; Naomi also had plenty of news about their post-Galaxie 500 project. On 8 September 20|20|20 will release a compilation of the duo&#39;s Sub Pop years containing 74 minutes of tracks taken from the four albums released by the label. No tracklist as yet but as soon as I have one I&#39;ll post it. Later in September new Brooklyn based film and music label Factory25 will release 1001 Nights, a DVD compilation of live performances, tour films and videos. It includes the previously released &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; tour film and an unreleased &quot;Japanese Scrapbook&quot; film as well as live selections and three music videos. The DVD will be released on 29 September and will be available as a limited edition which will come with a vinyl LP of the Live in San Sebastian album. You can download the music video of &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; as a preview." />
