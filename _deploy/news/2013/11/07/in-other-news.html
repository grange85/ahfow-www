<blockquote><p>Noise and music are not always the same, but to the historian they certainly can be: "Musical Instruments" is one of the categories of sounds on The Roaring Twenties, as is "Radio and Music Shops" (don’t miss the fantastic newsreel footage of Radio Row on Cortland Street, where all the shops broadcast different music into the street simultaneously).

<p>Dean &amp; Britta are playing two shows as part of <a href="http://thecabinetofwonders.com/">Wesley Stace's Cabinet of Wonders</a> - Dean posted on Facebook... "we will play three songs in a night of music, comedy, and I'm not sure what else" - they play on the 11 November in San Francisco and on the 13th in Santa Barbara.</p>
