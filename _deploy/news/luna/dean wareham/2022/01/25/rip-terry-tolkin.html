<p>Last week Terry Tolkin passed away. He was the A&amp;R man who played a significant part in the begiining of Luna and signed them to Elektra when he was an A&amp;R with the label.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Terry Tolkin has passed away this day in New Orleans, age 62. He was hospitalized a few weeks ago, has been dealing with sepsis and organ failure. His brother Daniel has been watching over him this week. Terry has been through a lot in recent years, I honestly think he is now in a better place. He was a key figure in my life, for Luna and many other musical artists he believed in.

  <p>I wasn’t surprised at all when they broke up, because I did it. I took Dean to lunch and told him that I was going to be leaving for a major label (Elektra) soon, and I just wanted him. He breathed a long sigh of relief. Dean’s not that confrontational and Galaxie 500 coulda dragged on for even another fucking album because of it.

<blockquote>
  <p>Terry wanted me to be his first signing at Elektra. […]  [He] got me $3000 to record the demos for Elektra. I booked time at Wharton Tiers Fun City studio on East Twenty-second Street. Jimmy Chambers of Mercury Rev came into town to play drums on most of the tracks, with Hamish Kilgour of The Clean doing a few of them too. I played the guitar and bass and keyboards myself. Seven songs in total, which I delivered to Terry at Elektra.

<p>In 2015 Dean <a href="/2015/06/28/dean-warehams-luna-demos-on-bandcamp-for-terry-tolkin/">made the demos available on Bandcamp</a> to help pay Terry’s medical bills.</p>

<p>Terry also ran his own label, No.6 that released Dean’s first solo single (from the demos mentioned above) as well as a Luna EP and the <a href="/category/cagney-lacee/">Cagney &amp; Lacee</a> album Six Feet of Chain (Cagney &amp; Lacee was Dean Wareham’s side project with his then wife Claudia).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Terry was a wonderful storyteller and bon vivant, and people loved being around him,” Wareham tells Variety. “We were the musical artists, but he was the one who lived like a rock star, running up hotel and restaurant tabs, riding in limos, getting in trouble, and sharing everything he had.”

<p>A few years back I had a couple of lengthy video chat’s with Terry, not sure why - he just messgaed me one day and asked if he could call - I agreed on the condition that he didn’t spend time dissing Damon and Naomi - which he agreed to (although didn’t completely abide by!) - we stayed in touch through occasional email, IMs and on Facebook. I never met him but I’m grateful for these brief interactions and for the part he played in the beginning of Luna.</p>
