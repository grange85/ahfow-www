<h2>Dean Wareham vs Cheval Sombre</h2>
<p>After making their debut live performance at the tail of 2018 on the East Coast - the duo were back together for a couple of west coast dates in January. The shows, in <a href="/database/dean-and-britta/shows/2019/2019-01-25-dean-wareham-vs-cheval-sombre-zebulon-los-angeles-ca-usa/">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="/database/dean-and-britta/shows/2019/2019-01-26-dean-wareham-vs-cheval-sombre-the-chapel-san-francisco-ca-usa/">San Francisco</a>, were made up of a set running through most of the fabulous Dean vs. Cheval Sombre cowboy songs LP (only Wandrin' Star failed to get an outing), followed by a Dean Wareham <em>solo</em> set made up of tracks from his solo releases and some Galaxie 500 gems thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Sadly I wasn't there so had to enjoy the shows through pals and YouTube&hellip;</p>

<h2>Damon Krukowski on <em>What is Democracy</em></h2>
<p>Over on Pitchfork Damon has a piece looking at Astra Taylor's documentary _What is Democracy_ through the eyes of the modern music industry&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>The resulting narrative is nothing like a cable news debate. All the various thinking in the film combines to a cogent, difficult argument about the troubled relationship between bounded democratic communities and unbounded global capital. To explain that through film, Taylor takes the viewer to Athens, Greece — original locus of democracy, and current home to both a financial and refugee crisis. But to explain it here, I want to take you to Athens, Georgia.

<h2>An interview with Dean Wareham</h2>
<p>After the Dean Wareham vs. Cheval Sombre show in New York in December photographer Ellen Qbertplaya carried out a lovely interview with Dean asking important questions about westerns and sandwiches:</p>
<blockquote>My parents played Marty Robbins album Gunfighter Ballads in the house — I imagine a lot of our parents bought that one in the early 1960s. "Wand’rin’ Star" was actually a number 1 hit for Lee Marvin in the UK, on the only song he ever recorded. We should all be so lucky.
