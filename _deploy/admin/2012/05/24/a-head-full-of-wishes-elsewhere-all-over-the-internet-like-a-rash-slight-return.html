<meta name="description" content="Not done this for a while so... a little plug for where else you can find A Head Full of Wishes out there on the &#39;net... The A Head Full of Wishes Facebook page is growing and while it&#39;s not quite buzzing with activity it ticks over rather nicely - getting close to 900 &quot;likes&quot; - while I&#39;m not one to put much store by these numbers still nice to see that there&#39;s still an interest. A Head Full of Wishes is also on Twitter as @ahfow - mostly it&#39;s just links to stuff I find and stuff post - if you want more discussion you can also (or alternatively) choose to follow me - @grange85 - but you will have to put up with all the other nonsense I spout! The Mailing list is very quiet these days - it&#39;ll have the occasional spurt of activity (and it&#39;s lovely when it does) and if I was a better caretaker I&#39;d take better care of it. Come join us anyway! There are a few releavant groups on Flickr: The main one called (surprisingly) A Head Full of Wishes has close to 700 pictures in its pool and is growing constantly. There&#39;s my failed A Fashion Parade of Wishes - where folk (mostly me) can share pictures of them in their AHFoW related fashion (T-shirts) - just 19 pictures. There&#39;s also You Turned My Head Around which catches pictures of Britta at a certain moment in a certain song - 38 pictures, but it&#39;s been out of the setlist for a while. The Galaxie group - that wasn&#39;t set up by me but was set up for &quot;any excuse to name a photo after a Galaxie 500 song, or for that matter Luna and similar/related music&quot; finally succumbed almost entirely to photos of cars... except when I belligerently post a picture! I&#39;ve also set up a Pinterest board to post some of the more quirky (or plain awesome) pictures I find. I also run the official Galaxie 500 page on MySpace but have to admit that I mostly don&#39;t - but I let myself off because Damon &amp; Naomi asked me to run it but they&#39;ve not been updating their MySpace page either! If you just want links you can keep an eye on my ahfow tag on Pinboard which I use to manage my links." />
