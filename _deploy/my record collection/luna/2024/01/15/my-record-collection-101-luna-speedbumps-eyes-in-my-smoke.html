<p>The b-side has two songs and runs at 33rpm, luckily the label clearly declares what speed you should spin the record at. Track <em>b1</em>, Astronaut, was the first track with music written by Lee Wall that was recorded by Luna (I think he also wrote <em>Star-Spangled Man</em>) - the lyrics were written by Dean. The track was recorded during the Romantica sessions and was released on the <em>Close Cover Before Striking</em> EP and then remixed for Rendezvous.</p>

<p>Astronaut was quite a live regular towards the end of Luna’s first phase but think it might only have been played recently when they performed Rendezvous in full back in 2017.</p>

<p>I moaned last time about the labels claiming this is a double A-side… but it just occurred to me that since the flip has two songs on it does this make it a triple-A side!</p>
