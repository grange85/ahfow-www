    <p>I’ve been a bit neglectful of AHFoW over the last few months - maybe because there hasn’t been a great deal happening in camp-AHFoW - or, more likely, I’ve been in a bit of an imagination slump. A few years ago I did a series of posts looking at the <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/category/originals/">original versions of all the songs covered by AHFoW-related bands</a> - obviously… that’s already a bit out of date so will need q revisit/update at some point - but… not now. I also did a <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/category/artefacts/">flurry of posts about “Artefacts” in my collection</a> but that fizzled out - I might resurrect that at some point - but… not now.</p>

<p>So, how to fill my time, and my blog!?</p>

<p>My record (and CD)  collection is pretty big, although (sadly) not as big as it once was - I downsized considerably before we moved. The Oxfam record shop (and a few other charity shops) in Ealing took literally hundreds of my LPs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/grange85/collection">My Discogs collection</a> currently has 2381 entries - that doesn’t include everything I still have, maybe about half?</p>

<p>The ‘A Head Full of Wishes’ folder in my Discogs collection (which probably does have <em>almost</em> of all my AHFoW related releases) numbers 319</p>

<p>After filtering out the more… <em>remote</em> releases (e.g. guest appearances, production credits, etc.) I’m left with just over 200 - although, some are duplicates and I suspect some that have been filtered out maybe shouldn’t have been!</p>

<p>So, I have taken all the releases by Galaxie 500, Damon &amp; Naomi, Luna and Dean &amp; Britta, sorted them randomly, and will try and post something about each of them.</p>

<p>To be honest, I’m not sure that all that many will have a story to tell, and even fewer will have an <em>interesting</em> story - but… I need to try and get myself back in the swing of things. So… this is more for me than you - although please feed back. I know the blog has no comments but I can be found all over social media!</p>
