    <p>Not that I’d consider Tanya Donelly <em>noise</em> but this is possibly the release in this series with the largest <em>signal:noise</em> ratio. It’s a triple album with 31 tracks on, and is here because just one of those tracks - 3’57” of the almost two hours of the album - features Damon and Naomi, as performers and co-writers.</p>

<div class="text-center"><figure class="figure w-100"><img src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/tanya-donnelly-swan-songs.jpg" class="figure-image img-fluid rounded mx-auto" alt="Tanya Donnelly - Swan Song Series (3xLP)" /><figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Tanya Donnelly - Swan Song Series (3xLP)</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>The sleeve notes don’t mention who specifically plays on what - there’s just a great long list of “PLAYERS”, so I thought that there was a chance that Damon and Naomi put in <em>guitar/voice</em> (Damon) and <em>bass/keyboard</em> (Naomi) duty on other tracks.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>But the sleeve does say “for liner notes and more info regarding credits, please visit www.tanyadonelly.com” but, currently this site is “under construction” - <strong>seriously, if you’re going to put sleeve notes on a website you really HAVE TO keep that content live</strong>!</p>

<p>Fortunately we can thank (as we can so often) the Internet Archive’s fantastic Wayback Machine which has the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161026154045/http://tanyadonelly.com/">website archived from 2016</a> and means I can track down <em>more info regarding credits</em> and there is no evidence that Damon or Naomi appeared on any of the other tracks.</p>

<p>So, it looks like it is just that one track, which is the lovely <a href="https://youtu.be/83nVVsEZ4wY">Storm Blown Bird</a> which wasn’t part of the main <em>Swan Song Series</em> but was included as a bonus track in the series. This is how Tanya described the track</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Storm Blown Bird (Donelly/Damon Krukowski/Naomi Yang)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tanya — guitars and vox</li>
    <li>Damon Krukowski — guitar and vox</li>
    <li>Naomi Yang — bass, keyboards</li>
    <li>Dean Fisher — drums, percussion
Recorded and Mixed by Rafi Sofer at Q Division Studios, Somerville MA</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I was a Damon and Naomi fan before we became friends, and was nervous and excited to work with them. We share an attraction to winding, non-linear, tempo-mixing music, and this is definitely apparent in this song. The main body was recorded live, with a few overdubs ~ happily old-school, and an extremely fun day. The musicality of these two people is inspiring, and wonderful to experience. A song about running into the night.</p>

<p>The Swan Song Series were a series of five EPs released digitally over time via Bandcamp and featuring a number of well known musical friends, it was then collected into this three LP set which I bought direct from UK distributors Cargo for £30.99 + postage.</p>

<p>The EPs are still available on Bandcamp for <em>name your price</em>: <a href="https://tanyadonelly.bandcamp.com/album/swan-song-series-vol-1">Vol. 1</a>, <a href="https://tanyadonelly.bandcamp.com/album/swan-song-series-vol-2">Vol. 2</a>, <a href="https://tanyadonelly.bandcamp.com/album/swan-song-series-vol-3">Vol. 3</a>, <a href="https://tanyadonelly.bandcamp.com/album/swan-song-series-vol-4">Vol. 4</a>, <a href="https://tanyadonelly.bandcamp.com/album/swan-song-series-vol-5">Vol. 5</a>, <a href="https://tanyadonelly.bandcamp.com/album/swan-song-series-bonus-tracks">Bonus tracks</a> <em>which doesn’t have Damon and Naomi’s contribution</em>.</p>

<p>Or you can pay <a href="https://americanlaundromatrecords.bandcamp.com/album/swan-song-series">$12 to buy them collected into one release</a>, that does include <em>Damon and Naomi’s contribution</em> via American Laundromat. I guess you can probably also get the LP and CD versions.</p>

<p>I have to admit that a triple album is an imposing thing to listen to in one sitting, and I probably hadn’t done it until it came to writing this blog post… I’ve been trying to think of the other triple LPs I have, and whether I ever listen to them in one go. A very quick/lazy scan of my shelves found…</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 x Cavern of Anti Matter triple LPs - probably listened to them both… once.</li>
  <li><a href="https://lauriespiegel.bandcamp.com/album/the-expanding-universe">Laurie Spiegel - The Expanding Universe</a> triple LP - actually have listened to this quite a lot… although more often I suspect the Bandcamp download!</li>
  <li>Neil Young - Decade - I’d guess I listened to this quite a lot way back - but not so much recently.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>there are definitely more, but suspect they don’t get listened to very often!</em></p>
