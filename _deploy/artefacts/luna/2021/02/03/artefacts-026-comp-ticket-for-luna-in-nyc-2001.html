    <p>At the beginning of 2001 Luna played a series of dates in various venues across NYC and I convinced Hazel that she would like a weekend break in NYC in February. We arranged to leave the boy with his grandparents and to stay with Bob in NYC for the weekend and we came over.</p>

<p>For the second show, 20 years ago today, Dean said he’d put me on the guestlist but for some reason I wasn’t on the list - or they couldn’t <em>find</em> the list. Bob and I were then taken downstairs while they tried to arrange something. We loitered, and chatted with a Brit in the backroom staff and finally we were supplied with comps.</p>

<p>NYC was freezing but Hazel and I managed lots of walking and plenty of touristy things and I got to see Luna twice.</p>

<p>We also visited Dean in his apartment but that’s a story I’ve told far too many times!</p>

<p>We sat snowbound for a few hours on the tarmac at JFK before finally making it home and retreiving the boy.</p>
