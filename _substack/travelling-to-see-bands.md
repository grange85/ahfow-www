Once upon a time I'd go and see the bands I loved when they came through town... it helped that my "town" was London, and pretty much everyone did come through. But I'd very rarely go see bands elsewhere. I was content to see the band once and then wait until the next time they passed through.

Something then changed, and I'm not so sure why or when. but suspect that it may have coincided with [The Galaxie 500 Mailing List]() in the late 90s and suddenly I was seeing these bands in other places. Hazel, my partner, wrote a piece for the first [Everything's Swirling fanzine]() about this:

<blockquote>
<p>If Andy hadn’t been a Galaxie 500 fan, I’d never have been to gigs in New York,
Porto, Berlin, Paris, and Dunfermline. If Andy hadn’t been a Galaxie 500 fan I’d
never have been to Abbey Road Studios and appeared on the cover of a single.</p>
<p>I’m not a fan though. I don’t see why I should be either. I like some of their songs
but Andy and I have never shared a bond over the band unlike I suspect he has
with a great number of non-family members. I see it like the relationship that
you have with a partner who keeps an allotment or works on steam engines.You
like the fruit and veg and the occasional trip out but generally you can leave the
obsessive to it.</p>

Because of the Mailing List, I was in touch with other fans, from other parts of the world - I'm not a social person but this sort of forced me a little out of my comfort zone. The first of these _road trips_ I remember was in 1999 when Bob was over from the US for the London Terrastock, and we drove down to Brighton to catch Damon & Naomi (also over for Terrastock) - I arrived home in the early hours of the morning but still managed to post to the list!

<blockquote>
<p>Damon & Naomi hit
the stage just after 10 and despite suffering some irritating sound problems
still managed to dish out a scintillating set featuring a couple of new
numbers, a few old numbers (NYC, This Car..., Information Age etc.) and a
dreamy cover of Big Star's "Blue Moon". They were bullied into an encore by
an enthusiastic crowd and left the stage too soon. Another D+N show another lovely evening.</p>

In early February 2001 Hazel and I took a trip to New York which "coincidentally" coincided with Luna playing two shows at The Knitting Factory. We were put up by Bob in a fantastic apartment in the city and walked too much and saw two Luna gigs... well I saw two, Hazel bailed on the second. This was also the trip that featured me melting in Dean's apartment, a story I've told too many times.

I think that might have been an outlier since it was a good few years before the trips overseas became a more regular thing and I think those were initially motivated by the Luna reunion in 2015 which did come to Europe but shockingly **didn't** come to London.
