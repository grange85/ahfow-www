So... back after a couple of weeks off. Christmas was, as it generally is, a fairly quiet time for me just time spent eating, watching telly, and walking on the beach.

I'm just back from a few days in The Smoke for a fantastic Damon & Naomi residency at Cafe Oto. I've scrawled a few words and [shared pictures and videos over here](), although none of that comes close to revealing how special this all was. This, and [a week in the summer]() have made for a remarkable few months in the world of AHFoW.

The first two randomly selected releases from [my record collection](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/category/my-record-collection?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20260109) are fairly slight so welcome to a gentle start to rthe new year for the AHFoW newsletter

### My record collection [315] Galaxie 500 - Uncollected Noise New York '88-'90 (CD)

This is a CD version of the expanded Uncollected that was released a couple of years back and was bought as a collection filler direct from Damon & Naomi a couple of months after the release of the LP versions - I've already [written about the two copies of that](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/10/08/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-09-and-10-galaxie-500-uncollected-noise-new-york-88-90/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20260109).

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-uncollected-nny-88-90-cd.jpg" "Uncollected Noise New York (CD)" %}

Since I have two LP versions, and a digital download (since I bought one of the LP versions via Bandcamp) there was no real reason to take this out of it's shrink-wrap... but, I just have because I guess there's no real reason not to.

I probably haven't listened to this through since I listened to the LPs when they first arrived... this sort of album isn't really an _album_ and so isn't really something that requires listening to in one sitting. The tracks weren't recorded as an album they only live together through the coincidence that at the time of recording they weren't considered worthy of release, or had a different purpose. 

Of course to a fan everything is worthy of a release because everything on this release is a historical artefact. So it exists for the fan, although I guess a boutique/deluxe release like this hopes to trawl in a few non fans, but surely no one who bought this wasn't already familiar with all of the bands output? The problem of course is that if it was for the fan why wasn't it complete?

Anyway... the CD package is a nice card gatefold sleeve that is identical to the LP version (only smaller) - no designer ever really mastered how to release double CDs - think of all those horrid fat jewel cases, or the ones with the flimsy extra flap inside. The card sleeve is as close as you can get - although having the discs slot in from the middle is I think a mistake that invites damage.

There were a couple of tracks on the album that I hadn't had bootlegs of before, Never Get to Heaven was one, in the booklet Dean suggests that it "almost sounds like a parody" - but maybe that's why I like it although it does end sooner and more abruptly than I think I'd have liked.

### My record collection [316] Magic Hour - I Had a Thought / America

This is the ninth of (currently) ten Magic Hour entries in [my record collection](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/category/my-record-collection?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20260109) and is a pink vinyl version of the I Had a Thought / America single that has [already put in an appearance](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/03/28/my-record-collection-122-magic-hour-i-had-a-thought-america/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20260109).

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/magic-hour-i-had-a-thought-pink-7.jpg" "Magic Hour - I Had a Thought / America (pink)" %}

The band recorded one Peel Session on the 3rd May 1994 and recorded a version of I Had a Thought. The session was broadcast on 10th June 1994 and, to my knowledge, has never been repeated. Fortunately you can [hear the session on AHFoW](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2013/10/04/audio-magic-hour-peel-session/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20260109).

Since the last copy was definitely an eBay purchase I guess I must have bought this around the time of release.

### Discoveries and rediscoveries

#### Luna and Yo La Tengo in San Francisco

Luna played three shows at the end of the year with Yo La Tengo in San Francisco - recordings of the first two are currently being seeded on Bittorrent (account required)
 - [Torrent  #806860  Luna - 2025 12 28 @ The Fillmore, San Francisco CA](http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=806860)
 - [Torrent  #807380  Luna - 2025 12 29 @ The Fillmore, San Francisco CA](http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=807380)

Luna and/or Dean also joined Yo La Tengo for their encores so it's worth checking out the recordings of those shows too.
 - [Torrent  #806812  Yo La Tengo - 2025 12 28 @ The Fillmore, San Francisco CA](http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=806812)
 - [Torrent  #807379  Yo La Tengo - 2025 12 29 @ The Fillmore, San Francisco CA](Torrent  #807379  Yo La Tengo - 2025 12 29 @ The Fillmore, San Francisco CA [MK4 24/48])

I'm hoping the recordings of New Year's Eve will turn up too.

There are also some cool clips on YouTube:
