### My record collection: The Shimmy Disc Compilation Volume 1 (VHS)

Another VHS, and now that I [actually have a VHS player](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/07/03/video-galaxie-500-at-subterania-27th-june-1990/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250926) one I can actually sit down and watch... although, of course because someone has been kind enough to digitise the whole thing and [pop it onto YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aULilR7TS6c) - it's easier to do that.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/shimmy-disc-video-compilation-vol-1-vhs.jpg" "The Shimmy Disc Compilation Volume 1 (VHS)" %}

The compilation is packed with the usual Shimmy Disc faces, and compiled with the expected Shimmy Disc idiosyncracies. Each track is introduced with 1980s wedding video style text intros.

Galaxie 500's contribution is Sergio Huidor's video for Tugboat.

There were two more Shimmy Disc video comps - Volume 2, which I don't have (but am on the lookout for), had the video for When Will You Come Home, and Volume 3 had no contribution from Galaxie 500 at all. 

I bought this on eBay in 2014 although not sure for how much.

### My record collection: The Pastels - Illumination (CD)

So...  a second copy of The Pastels excellent Illumination. I think I bought this in a bundle with some things I didn't have, or I just added it to make up postage. But, whatever reason I do have two copies!

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/the-pastels-illumination-no-2.jpg" "The Pastels - Illumination (CD)" %}

_... and since I have two copies I can photograph both sides of the fold-out booklet in one pic!_

To be honest I was going to skip this one when it popped up in my backlog but... I have actually seen The Pastels since [I last posted about the album](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2023/05/04/my-record-collection-031-the-pastels-illumination/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250926) over two years ago... and they don't play very often! So... I guess I can write about that...

Back in July, just before they were scheduled to play Glas-Goes-Pop The Pastels had a matinee gig scheduled at The Cumberland Arms in Byker - only their second live show since 2019 (the first had been a couple of weeks earlier in Edinburgh). It was a swelteringly hot afternoon - and inside the crowded room was ridiculous! I arrived early, almost too early, so when the doors opened I positioned myself against the wall near the front of the stage (it's my position of choice at The Cumberland Arms).

Support was from Carla J. Easton who played a charming and lively set.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/carla-j-easton-cumberland-arms.jpg" "Carla J. Easton at The Cumberland Arms" %}

The break arrived and, having been spotted by Janet in the crowd, we both retired outside into the fresh air for a chat before The Pastels. The breeze was refreshing and under some circumstances I might have been tempted to stay in the garden... or at least stand by the open door. But... The Pastels! So, as showtime approached I edged my way back close to where I had been standing.

The Pastels were, of course, wonderful - as they always are - cracking songs (including a couple from Illumination!), charming between songs banter, and knowing when it's too hot to carry on so not overstaying their welcome!

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/the-pastels-at-the-cumberland-arms.jpg" "The Pastels at The Cumberland Arms" %}

I briefly chatted with Pastels guitarist John (also of the excellent [National Park](http://www.nationalparksite.com/)) about how great Dean Wareham's new album is. Said a quick "hello" to Stephen and headed out into the cool, and then onto the hot metro, and then home.

Oh... and also since the last Illumination post I hung out in a pub in Glasgow with The Pastels!

### This week in history

#### 26th September 2020 - Dean & Britta live stream x 2

On this day in COVID year 1 - Dean & Britta (and Roger) played two live streamed shows from their living room - here they are playing We're Not Supposed to be Lovers from the early show

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtX1aDZQlUI

... and Simon & Garfunkel's Homeward Bound from the late show

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LafGLcsc0Ok

#### 1st October 1990 - This Is Our Music released

On this day 35 years ago Galaxie 500's last album was released (in the UK)

I still struggle with the commonly held belief that This Is Our Music is somehow sub-par Galaxie 500 - I think it’s become one of those ideas that people latch onto without really considering it… almost an urban myth. But damn! It’s such a good album. I thought that at the time and my love of it hasn’t diminished at all over the years, if anything it has grown. Even the protaganists play it down… “it could have been twice as good” said Kramer; “half of it is good” said Dean… I don’t think they’re hearing it like I do - I think they’re hearing the making of it.
