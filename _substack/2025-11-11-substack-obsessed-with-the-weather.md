There's an interview somewhere (that I haven't tracked down yet) where Justin (Harwood, Luna's first bassist) accuses Dean Wareham of being "obsessed with the weather" and accuses him of watching The Weather Channel. Dean denies this... but, let's look at the evidence?

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/watching-the-weather-channel.jpg" "The Weather Channel by Dubs (2021)" %}

### Exhibit A - Dean's choice of cover versions

   <blockquote>
    I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'<br/>
    Thru the pourin' rain,<br/>
    Goin' where the weather suits my clothes.<br/>
<br/>
    Bankin' off the northeast wind,<br/>
    Sailin' on a summer breeze,<br/>
    Skippin' over the ocean like a stone.
   </blockquote>

    And he can see it on the radar<br/>
    Only seven hours away<br/>
    Well there's gonna be a snowstorm<br/>
    When the t.v has gone wild<br/>
    And they got nothin else to think of<br/>
    And they're letting me go home

 - Sorry - Galaxie 500
   <blockquote>
    Well I'm sorry about the weather<br/>
    And I'm sorry that the drive was much too far<br/>
    Seems like everything is business<br/>
    And were sorry all the time<br/>
<br/>
    But when we're home (all alone)<br/>
    What is home (on your own)<br/>
    Home is home (all alone)<br/>
    Where we love the weather
   </blockquote>

So the evidence seems to suggest that Dean may indeed be "obsessed with the weather" - although the weather isn't always nice to him. At the 1997 Benicassim Festival in Spain the weather turned against its biggest fan...

<blockquote>
<p>It was a warm and muggy afternoon, and it rained for a while, but then the rain abruptly stopped.</p>

<p>This was the proverbial calm before the storm, a storm that roared in off the Mediterranean. I was standing at the back of the stage, starting to take my guitar out of its case and get my pedals ready, when I noticed the extraordinary wind. I looked up at the huge metal scaffolding that held the lights above the stage, and the big canvas sign with all the sponsors' names on it blowing in the wind. It didn't look quite right to me. I thought of Curtis Mayfield, who was paralyzed in 1990 when a lighting rig fell on him at an outdoor gig in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Then came the rain. It came in horizontally, and Urusei Yatsura's drum kit started to move. Those brave/stupid Scottish kids kept playing their song even as the wind blew the drum kit clean off the stage. Ten seconds later I saw the entire scaffolding come crashing down, and the stage col-lapsed and everyone was running and screaming.</p>
