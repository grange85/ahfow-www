This week John Lennon should have reached his 85th birthday so let's have a look at where he has touched A Head Full of Wishes...

### Rain

Rain was written by John (credited as with all their songs to Lennon-McCartney) and recorded by The Beatles in April 1966. In [Revolution in The Head]() Ian McDonald says that it "expresses the vibrant lucidity of a benign LSD experience" (something that Dean did later with Decomposing Trees?). The Beatles released it as the b-side to Paperback Writer and is I guess the most notable b-side in the band's canon.

It is very much a product of the studio, and George Martin's, studio experimentation, with varied speeds, and reversed tapes make George M very much the fifth Beatle (or The Beatles' Kramer) on this (and so many of their more experimental songs).

There was a film clip made for the song (and for the single's a-side Paperback Writer) in the gardens of Chiswick House, not far from where I lived/worked for many years... we visited many times and I sort of wish we'd been more attentive to the locations used in the films - but here's a pic of the boy near one of the locations... probably!

... and here's a clip of outtakes from the film shoot...

Galaxie 500 included Rain in their live sets during 1989, and it most notably turned up in a live version, recorded at CBGBs in May 1989, on a [Caff single](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/galaxie-500/releases/singles/#rain-don-t-let-our-youth-go-to-wastecaff-9):

You can also hear them [playing it at their ICA show in London in September 1989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JCgyTzj0M4&t=173s).

My database also has a record that shows that Luna played it (at least) once in [Eugene, OR in 1995](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/shows/luna-1995-10-14-john-henrys-eugene-or-usa/) .

### Hold On (John)

Hold on was on John Lennon's debut solo album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band released in 1970
John Lennon - Hold On (play on YouTube)

<blockquote>
I'm saying 'hold on John' because I don't want to die...I don't want to be hurt and please don't hit me...Hold on now, we might have a cup of tea, we might get a moment's happiness any minute now. So that's what it's about, just moment by moment. That's how we're living now, but really living like that and cherishing each day, and dreading it too. It might be your last.
</blockquote>

Luna never released a version of the track but covered it quite frequently in 1994, [this post](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2013/08/14/originals-hold-on-by-john-lennon-covered-by-luna/) has an mp3 of a live radio recording made for KCRW on the 4th April.

### Jealous Guy

Jealous Guy started out as Child of Nature, written after The Beatles attended a lecture by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and demoed at Harrison’s home in Esher in 1968.

The track never made it onto a Beatles album and was rewritten as Jealous Guy for Lennon’s Imagine.

Luna recorded the track for Noah Baumbach’s 1997 film Mr Jealousy - here's a promo video with Luna playing it accompanied by clips from the film - it'd be nice if a better quality version of this turned up some time!

### Happy Xmas (War is Over)
