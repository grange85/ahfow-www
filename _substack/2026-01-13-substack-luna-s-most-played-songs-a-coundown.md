Not long after I started the web site in late 1994 fans started sending me lists of songs that Luna were playing on their tours and added to that I have quite a few recordings of shows so over the years I have built up quite a collection. I have full or partial set-lists from 472 shows from 1992 to 2025.

There are however gaps - lots of missing shows, and plenty of missing set-lists. If anyone can help fill any of those gaps please get in touch! I have more set-lists post 1995, and considerably more from the 21st Century, so the data is rather skewed to more recent times - so... obviously what follows should be taken with a hefty pinch of salt!

- Luna shows in the db = 820
- Luna shows in the db with a setlist = 472

... and now, the top 10...

#### 10 - {% ahfowtrack "California (All the Way)" %} (played 208 times)

Despite the band's occasional reluctance to play _California_ it is one of Luna's most popular songs and they're nothing if not crowd pleasers! Here's a clip of them reluctantly playing it for the World Cafe in 1997:

#### 9 - {% ahfowtrack "Pup Tent" %} (played 214 times)

 - [Video: Luna playing Pup Tent in 2000](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2008/10/18/video-luna-playing-pup-tent-in-2000/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20260113) - this is a low-res video but contains a very early appearance of Britta with the band.

#### 8 - {% ahfowtrack "Bewitched" %} (played 223 times)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGLgbp-B4-U

 - [Bewitched by Bewitched with Kelly on trumpet](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2017/01/27/bewitched-by-bewitched-with-kelly/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20260113).

#### 7 - {% ahfowtrack "Lost in Space" %} (played 231 times)

While I do realise that the top of this countdown is getting quite Penthouse heavy I was perhaps a little surprised at Lost in Space being this high up - although since it does quite often pair with _23 Minutes_ I probably shouldn't have been!

#### 6 - {% ahfowtrack "Tiger Lily" %}	(played 235 times)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ry7HCGU4eE

#### 5 - {% ahfowtrack "Moon Palace" %} (played 254 times)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXki8W6mlcI

#### 4 - {% ahfowtrack "Chinatown" %} (played 279 times)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK-_wFhnPGo

#### 3 - {% ahfowtrack "Sideshow by the Seashore" %} (played 292 times)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MugwxCqCRO4

#### 2 - {% ahfowtrack "Friendly Advice" %} (played 308 times)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2IWRMB0c2M

#### 1 - {% ahfowtrack "23 Minutes in Brussels" %} (played 367 times)

I guess it's not really a surprise that the song that the fans love most is the song that gets played the most - the first few times it was played it ptobably wasn't called 23 Minutes in Brussels

I put in a fleeting appearance in that video chatting to Lee and wearing a fab Sonic Cathedral T that sadly got so much use it wore out!

### Most played Dean & Britta / Dean Wareham shows

Since Britta is almost always in Dean's band and since billing is sometimes ambiguous, Dean and Dean & Britta live together in my db - to add to the confusion there have been quite a few _plays Galaxie 500_ shows, and also a lot of _13 Most Beautiful_ ones where the setlists are somewhat pre-determined...

- Dean & Britta / Dean Wareham shows in the db = 540
- Dean & Britta / Dean Wareham shows in the db with a setlist = 245

Top 5:

 - **1** Knives From Bavaria (played 122 times)
 - **2** Tugboat (112)
 - **3** I'll Keep It With Mine (101)
