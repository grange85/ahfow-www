Last time out I reached The Days of Our Nights in Luna's art gallery before I realised things were getting a bit lengthy. Now, time to wrap things up, first with the remaining studio albums and then a few extras at the end.

### Romantica (2002)

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/substack-romantica-and-lovedust.jpg" "Romantica and Lovedust" %}

The painting of the lighter on the front of Luna's sixth album is by [Steve Ellis](https://www.instagram.com/stevellisart/) and is one of a series of lighter pictures he had made - another turned up on the cover of the promo single of Lovedust and you can see even more hanging in the art gallery the band play in for the Lovedust video. I love this pic of Britta and Lee that I've pinched from [Steve's instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stevellisart/).

Here's the video in full:

In a previous post I expressed some concern with the painting - a problem that is entirely mine!

<blockquote>
The problem I have is that the lighter, being a lighter, I guess, isn’t rectangular - on the CD sleeve it's wider at the top than the bottom. Now, in my head it is rectangular, which means that whenever I look at the sleeve my brain keeps telling me that the lighter is... wonky. It looks... wrong, like a mistake has been made when I know it hasn’t.
</blockquote>

When Dean played at Indietracks in 2014 Raymond Richards, Dean's guitarist during 2014, gave me a lighter with the Romantica design on it - this wasn't _merch_ but I guess a sort of bootleg item. Since I have absolutely no use for a lighter it is still full of fuel, and works, although I do worry that it's going to spontaneously combust.

A drawing by Steve Ellis of a/the lighter also made it onto a [very cool Luna T-shirt](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cvu_sXRRWGa/?img_index=5) (which I can't model for you since I never got around to getting one).

A, and I presume this, Steve Ellis will be making another appearance further down the page.

I do also love the reflection photo on the back of the album by Stefano Giovannini - I do love reflections, and I love that the photographer is putting in an appearance!

### Rendezvous (2004)

OK this is the bit that needs to be flagged as NSFW! The sleeve of Rendezvous is by photo artist Chas Ray Krider and until I wrote a post in the [my record collection series on Rendezvous](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/03/21/my-record-collection-120-luna-rendezvous-lp/) I hadn't thought about looking into his work. The front shows a young woman to the right of the image, smoking in her underwear. Suffice to say that she is wearing considerably more than most of the young women in Mr Krider's photos... and being considerably more... coy!

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/substack-luna-rendezvous-krider.jpg" "Luna - Rendezvous" %}

You can find more of his pictures around the internet but... be warned there's a lot of nudity involved!

 - I suspect the images used in Rendezvous were from his [Motel Fetish series](https://web.archive.org/web/20240913123318/http://motelfetish.com/frontdesk.html), although I haven't found the actual pictures (although I'm sure I've seen them somewhere).
 - There are a couple of Instagram accounts [@chasray](https://www.instagram.com/chasray/) and [@chasray_art_oddities](https://www.instagram.com/chasray_art_oddities).
 - The official website/shop can be found at [The Chas Ray Krider Collection](https://chasraykrider.com/).

I do rather like this sleeve but my oft-mentioned prudishness forces me to make this section shorter than the others!

... and now on to the _extras_.

### Best of Luna (2006)

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/substack-best-of-luna-tominex2.jpg" "Best of Luna x 2" %}

Best of Luna has a beautiful illustration by Adrian Tomine, the rare case of an artist I loved the work of before his art turned up on a Luna album, although I most likely heard about him via The Galaxie 500 Mailing List, or via someone else mentioned on the list.

On release of Best of Luna there was a limited edition signed print available that I shied away from since it was a bit pricey for my natural meanness. I have however subsequently got a print of a different drawing signed by Adrian on my wall (thanks to Andrew). It also has the same name as a Luna song so it almost works!

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/substack-double-feature-tomine.jpg" "Double Feature by Adrian Tomine on my wall" %}

The picture on the sleeve was included in the collection New York Drawings.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/adrian-tomine-new-york-drawings-best-of-luna.jpg" "Best of Luna in New York Drawings" %}

I suspect Adrian Tomine is probably most famous now for his drawings for The New Yorker, and possibly most famously for "Missed Connection" which was also on the cover of New York Drawings.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/adrian-tomine-new-york-drawings.jpg" "caption" %}

Dean mentions that the lyrics of the Luna song Dear Diary concern "spying a cute girl on the train, and she's reading silly magazines and singing a song, and I can't stop thinking about her" which has a bit of a _missed connection_ feel.

An LP version of Best of Luna would be good so I can get a 12" square version of Tomine's drawing!

### Lunafied (2018)

The cover of Lunafied is by artist and photographer Abelardo Morell and is one of a series of astoundingly beautiful photos taken by turning various rooms into a [camera obscura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura).

When Lunafied came out digitally in 2006 I wrote to Dean about the sleeve:

Hi Dean,  

I love the "sleeve" of the Lunafied album - particularly as I've been sucked into the pinhole-camera thing of late* so camera-obscura's are very exciting - I keep wanting to turn our bedroom into a camera obscura but Hazel rightly points out that the row of Victorian terraced houses on the opposite side of the road isn't quite the Empire State Building!

Does Lunafied exist as a "real" CD (maybe as a promo???) I'd love to own a proper CD with that sleeve! (sorry for the unsubtle attempted scrounge there!).

Any news on the Beggars covers album?

Have a nice summer,

-=Andy=-

Hi Andy,

the lunafied image is by Abelardo Morell, but perhaps you knew that already. His photos are great.

http://www.abelardomorell.net/

But there is no CD with that image, not even a promo. Rhino wanted it to be exclusive to the iTunes store. They have said that they might get around to releasing it on CD one day, but frankly I don't think it's going to happen. I can burn you a disc of Lunafied (from the master that was prepared).

Dean
