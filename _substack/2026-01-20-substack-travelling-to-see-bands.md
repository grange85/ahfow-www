Once upon a time I'd go and see the bands I loved when they came through town... it helped that my "town" was London, and pretty much everyone did come through. But I'd very rarely go see bands elsewhere. I was content to see the band once and then wait until the next time they passed through. 

I do remember, back in my metal days, of trips to Birmingham and Manchester and some south coast towns to see concerts but by the time I was living in London it seemed there was no real point to it, short of the occasional trek to Brighton.

One of those trips to Brighton was in 1999 when Bob was over from the US for the London Terrastock, and we drove down to Brighton to catch Damon & Naomi (also over for Terrastock) - I arrived home in the early hours of the morning but still managed to post to the list!

<blockquote>
<p>Damon & Naomi hit
the stage just after 10 and despite suffering some irritating sound problems
still managed to dish out a scintillating set featuring a couple of new
numbers, a few old numbers (NYC, This Car..., Information Age etc.) and a
dreamy cover of Big Star's "Blue Moon". They were bullied into an encore by
an enthusiastic crowd and left the stage too soon. Another D+N show another lovely evening.</p>

But that was just Brighton, hardly any distance at all really. I don't think I'd ever really considered leaving the country to see a band, that seemed a ridiculous thing to do. In 2001 Luna played a series of shows in various venues in/around NYC and I somehow convinced Hazel that a holiday in New York, in February, might be a good idea. So off we went. That weekend Luna played two shows at The Knitting Factory. We were put up by Bob in a fantastic apartment high up in the city and walked too much and saw two Luna gigs... well I saw two, Hazel bailed on the second. This was also the trip that featured me melting in Dean's apartment, a story I've told too many times.

February in NYC also meant snow which meant hours on the tarmac at JFK eating tiny bags of peanuts and hoping we'd make it home at some point! Sure there were two great Luna shows but it was all pretty exhausting for a naturally lazy person like me. So, the next few years were pretty much just London shows.




In 2005 Luna split... in 2015 they reformed and came to Europe... but not to the UK! Suddenly my hand was forced, if I wanted to see Luna for the first time in over ten years (and I did) I'd have to go abroad. Now, Hazel's not a Luna fan but she likes a holiday so after some negotiation we chose Porto for our next overseas jaunt.

We had a lovely week in Porto, did a lot of walking, ate lots of great food, saw a great Luna show, met some lovely Luna fans... and came home. Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all.

The following year we decided to go to Berlin to see Damon & Naomi, although this was the tour during which Damon fell down some stairs and wound up found in a hospital in London when he was meant to be playing at Cafe Oto and just days before the Berlin show so it did look like he might not make it. I got an email from Naomi at three in the morning after the accident assuring us that Damon had been given the go ahead to travel and that Berlin was on. This time as well as Hazel, I dragged the boy along.

We had a lovely few days in Berlin, did lots of walking, ate lots of food, saw Damon's bruises and saw a great Damon & Naomi show.

... and also Paris to see first Luna

... and later Britta supporting Keren Ann at The Olympia...

But... if we're going to go through all the hassle of going abroad shouldn't we make the most of it? Why see one show when we could see two? In 2017 Luna played a tour of Spain and we flew over stayed in Bilbao, hired a car, and saw shows in Santander and San Sebastián, but oddly not Bilbao which happened a week later by which time we back home.

<p>If Andy hadn’t been a Galaxie 500 fan, I’d never have been to gigs in New York,
Porto, Berlin, Paris, and Dunfermline. If Andy hadn’t been a Galaxie 500 fan I’d
never have been to Abbey Road Studios and appeared on the cover of a single.</p>
<p>I’m not a fan though. I don’t see why I should be either. I like some of their songs
but Andy and I have never shared a bond over the band unlike I suspect he has
with a great number of non-family members. I see it like the relationship that
you have with a partner who keeps an allotment or works on steam engines.You
like the fruit and veg and the occasional trip out but generally you can leave the
obsessive to it.</p>

Because of the Mailing List, I was in touch with other fans, from other parts of the world - I'm not a social person but this sort of forced me a little out of my comfort zone. The first of these _road trips_ I remember 

In early February 2001 Hazel and I took a trip to New York which "coincidentally" coincided with I think that might have been an outlier since it was a good few years before the trips overseas became a more regular thing and I think those were initially motivated by the Luna reunion in 2015 which did come to Europe but shockingly **didn't** come to London.
