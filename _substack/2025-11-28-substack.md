### Dean & Britta - 13 Most Beautiful (1.5xLP)

This is the sixth and (so far) final appearance of Dean & Britta's 13 Most Beautiful which probably wins for the most different formats in this series... this one is the LP version that was released by Danish indie Wouldn't Waste Records in 2017.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/dean-and-britta-13-most-beautiful-lp.jpg" "13 Most Beautiful LP" %}

This LP finds the 13 tracks spread over three sides of vinyl and this one *almost*  matches the single CD version that was originally released in 2011 on Dean and Britta's Double Feature Records. Only _almost_ because the CD had an unlisted extra track, the Scott Hardkiss remix of _Not a Young Man Anymore_.

Previously the collection was released as...

 - A DVD in 2009 for $30 - [My record collection #139](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/05/02/my-record-collection-132-13-most-beautiful-dvd/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20251228) and [My record collection #169](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/08/15/my-record-collection-162-13-most-beautiful-songs-for-andy-warhol-s-screen-tests-dvd/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20251228)
 - A deluxe DVD in 2009 for $250 - I couldn't afford this one!
 - A double CD collection in 2010 - [My record collection #104](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/01/08/my-record-collection-099-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-2xcd/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20251228) and [My record collection #180](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/09/23/my-record-collection-173-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-2xcd/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20251228)
 - A limited edition single CD in with 14 tracks 2011 [My record collection #224](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/02/17/my-record-collection-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-pink-cd/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20251228)

The 14 track single CD version is [also available to download](https://deanandbritta.bandcamp.com/album/13-most-beautiful-songs-for-andy-warhols-screen-tests), Dean did claim in a recent newsletter that "this sequence of the album follows the live show we performed" but it doesn't because I'm pretty certain the live shows always started with _Richard Rheem Theme_ (although apart from that it was in sequence).

Anyway... the LP is a lovely package (although sadly not in a gatefold sleeve) and comes with a nice card insert with a slightly edited version of the notes first included with the double CD version back in 2010. A slightly different version of the sleeve notes were [published in Bomb Magazine in 2009](https://bombmagazine.org/articles/2009/06/21/scoring-warhol-s-screen-tests/).

I've been lucky enough to see Dean & Britta perform 13 Most Beautiful twice, first time the UK premiere at [The Carnegie Hall in Dunfermline](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2009/07/09/13-most-beautiful-at-the-carnegie-hall-in-dunfermline/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20251228) in 2009, and then the [London premiere at The Barbican in 2010](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2010/07/31/review-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-the-barbican-london/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20251228) - both were exceptional but The Carnegie Hall show was the most special, and memorable.

Dean Wareham - Love is Colder Than Death (7")

So another duplicate in my _one for show, one for blow_ collection... although I guess since I'm playing everything in this series... they're now both _for blow_? Love is Colder Than Death was Dean's first solo single after more than a 20 year gap and was released on Sonic Cathedral in 2013.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/dean-wareham-love-is-colder-than-death-2.jpg" "Dean Wareham - Love is Colder Than Death" %}

Given that I've already covered the single twice - one the same as this, and the test pressing that Nat sent me back then - I guess there's not a lot more to say... maybe I'll just give a nod to another classic Dean rhyme - "cats and mices have their vices".

This is one of two copies I bought when Sonic Cathedral were selling them for just two quid a pop in 2014. I think I gave one away in a competition, or as a survey incentive, at some point.

Here's a nice clip of Dean, Britta and Roger playing the song in 2018.
