### Happy Galaxie 500 Day

Of course the 4th of July is Galaxie 500 day, if you celebrate, so...

### My record collection #263 - Selected Galaxie 500

The release of The Galaxie 500 box set in 1996 was the first time I became aware that my little web site was on the band's radar, and this lovely promo CD was, I think, the first physical manifestation of that.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-selected-promo-cd.jpg" "Selected Galaxie 500 promo CD" %}

Sadly I have lost a lot of my email communication from back then so this may not all be actually true... it is after all almost 30 years ago now.

I'm not sure exactly when I first heard from Andrea at Ryko about the box set but I do have memories of discussing with her what I would put on a promo disc, I'm not sure if anything I said had any bearing on this release, I suspect not. I imagine I certainly would have made a case for [Snowstorm](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/tracks/snowstorm/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250704), and possibly [Summertime](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/tracks/summertime/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250704), neither of which are on this - but otherwise it's pretty close to what I'd have picked.

The CD arrived, unannounced and with a note from Andrea on CD-sized Ryko compliments slip:

<blockquote>
<p>OK Andy,</p>
<p>Here if is. Finally. In your mailbox, almost in your CD player....</p>
<p>Oops. You're probably listening by now.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
<p>AT</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Note from Andrea Troolin</p>

The promo is beautifully packaged, it would have come in one of those greenish Ryko jewel cases - but as always with those boxes the little pegs that hold the disc in place would have fallen off so it has been put into a clear case. Although that means that you can see the inside back of the sleeve which has the gorgeous astronomical illustration that was on the cover of the box.

The insert was a single page and inside it announced the box set release date (24th September 1996) and some credits and contact details.

While I'd heard most of the unreleased content on [the cassette that Matthew sent me](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2023/08/17/my-record-collection-061-galaxie-500-unreleased-sessions-and-live-at-the-rat/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250704) this was probably the first time I heard [Final Day](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/tracks/final-day/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250704) with Dean's vocal.

Selected did get an official release in Japan as "Melt Away" but I don't own a copy of that.

When I interviewed Damon for the Terrascopaedia interview a couple of years ago he explained how Andrea had used my web site, and the Galaxie 500 Mailing List, to help convince Ryko to release the box set - my heart swelled with pride:

<blockquote>
But then Jeff hired a young assistant – maybe she was even an intern at first? – named Andrea Troolin, and Andrea found the project in that pile and made it hers. How to rally the company behind finally doing something with it, however? Your web site! Andrea pointed to the Galaxie 500 mailing list, and the activity on it, as evidence that there was interest out there in the band and its out-of-print catalogue. Next thing you know... box set! 
</blockquote>

Andrea was very good to me, the next treat to arrive was even more jaw-dropping and still one of my most prized possessions:

She also sent me a [promo of Copenhagen](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/05/20/my-record-collection-137-galaxie-500-copenhagen-promo-cd/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250704) ahead of its release.

### My record collection #264 - The Shield Around The K


I can't remember when I bought this DVD, Wikipedia says that it was released in 2006, so it was probably then, or not long after that. When I bought it I didn't know that Dean was a talking head in the film... so, it was bought for my love of K rather than my love of Dean.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/dean-wareham-the-shield-around-the-k.jpg" "Dean Wareham on The Shield Around The K" %}

The Shield Around The K is a documentary about K Records, and to be honest Dean's appearances are a little lightweight, and almost seem a little incongruous given that he didn't really have much of a K connection beyond his covers of Indian Summer. Maybe he just happened to be in town at the time - but, nice to see him turn up all the same.

Dean calls Indian Summer the "Knocking on Heaven's Door of indie rock, everybody has to do it", he also says he prefers Beat Happening's version over his own (solo) cover. Sonic Boom disagrees, he says that Spectrum covered it because of Dean Wareham's version and that he didn't really like Beat Happening's original! 

He's wrong though...
