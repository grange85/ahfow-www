For 25 years AHFoW surveyed the website and mailing list's users it was all very innocent and was fun. I'd ask users for their favourite tracks and albums, I'd try to find out how old they were, and what country they lived in, purely out of interest. Survey's these days are rarely that innocent - every phone call to any service is followed by a survey, every list you sign up to want to find out more about you - people are surely getting survey-ed out, I know I am. I like to think that this is the reason that voters tailed off towards the end of the AHFoW survey's run.

30 years ago this month, in December 1995, a year after the birth of the website and six months after the Galaxie 500 Mailing List came into being, I held the first of almost 30 annual surveys. I asked folk to email their responses in and spent hours compiling them into a readable form and then posting the results to the web site and mailing list - I must admit I was never really too sure how interested other people were in these numbers but I loved numbers... and, over time I loved that I could put them into a spreadsheet and do half-arsed, simplistic, and probably careless analysis on those numbers.

For this post I've dug into those spreadsheets to do some more of that.

By December of 1995 the mailing list had 124 subscribers and the first survey had 49 responses which seemed a fairly decent _hit rate_ - the only _demographic_ data I collected was age (intitially in five year and then later in ten year brackets) and country - here are a few idle thoughts on that

 - We all got older - I guess that's not a surprise - in that first survey over 90% of respondents were under 30, by the last survey in December 2020 almost the same amount were over 50!
 - In that first survey there was one person over 50... that was Bob, he'd finish top every year... although towards the end he was no longer alone in the over-60 category!
 - The vast majority of folk were in the US, with the UK a distant second - I guess that's not a surprise either.
 - There was almost always one response from Lebanon.
 - Over the run of the survey there were responses from 40 different countries.
