Another look at some of the memorabilia I've collected over the years although qhite a lot of this is _unofficial_ and some is my own handiwork so apologies.

I am particularly fond of fan-made memorabilia (which is I guess why I periodically go in for it) as well as the badges I have a few fan-made T-shirts that might put in an appearance at some point next time I'm struggling for a Substack post!

### [1] and [2] - Patches

I have two patches now, although neither have been sewn to my [battle jacket]() which has been mostly reserved for Motorhead patches and hasn't actually been added to since around 1982!

The _Luna mission patch_ was given away as a bonus with the [Sonic Cathedral]() singles club single of Something in the Air in 2019. A smaller version of the patch then appeared on a trucker hat in 2024 and some leftover iron-on patches are [still available from Dean's website](https://deanwareham.com/product/1192182-luna-iron-on-patch).

The Galaxie 500 patch was from a _failed beanie hat project_ and is an iron version that was sold from Dean's shop, and on the merch table at Damon & Naomi's London shows last month - Naomi gave me this one at one of those shows.

### [3] and [4] - Dean Wareham vs Cheval Sombre badges

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/substack-badges-patches-03.jpg" "Dean vs Cheval badges" %}

These are obviously _official_ ones. two different styles of badges, the smaller, pink ones are clearly extracts from the album sleeve, the larger shinier ones I was a little uncertain of, in fact I wondered for a while if they were related, but they're in my spreadsheet so I guess they all arrived with the deluxe bundle when I bought that in July 2018.

### [5] and [6] - Damon & Naomi badges

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/substack-badges-patches-04.jpg" "Damon & Naomi badges" %}

The two small badges [5] were given to me by Naomi after their show at The Water Rats in October 2003 - I have a feeling that there may have been a third version, but haven't tracked it down. The drawings were by French illustrator Marc Boutavant.

The two larger badges [6] were by artist Ai Yamaguchi - I can't remember when I got these, I guess they arrived in an order or pressie from Damon and/or Naomi.

### [7] and [8] - A Head Full of Wishes badges and business cards

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/substack-badges-patches-06.jpg" "AHFoW badges and business cards" %}

These were created for the fanzines and tribute albums released by AHFoW over the years. There are eight different designs, although the two spirals are pretty similar, I just decided to neaten it up and darken the blue for the second run. The business cards have my old address on them.

I still have a lot of badges left... if anyone wants any get in touch, I'd be happy to send a handful for postage costs (although postage costs are silly these days so probably not worth it) - [get in touch](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/about/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20260203) if you want.

### [9] LEGO This Is Our Music

I can't remember who sent me this but since it's [Christoph](https://www.instagram.com/popchristoph/)'s LEGO artwork I guess it may have been him?

### [10] and [11] Luna - Bewitched, Penthouse, and Rendezvous badges and "Anonymous Cads"

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/substack-badges-patches-05.jpg" "Luna albums + Anonymous Cads" %}

These were made by Jenell for when Luna played their three night residency at The Chapel in January 2017 - one for each of the albums featured. These were the shows recorded for the live albums... that I still haven't received! The "Anonymous Cads" badge is another of Jenell's.

### [12] Sing Me to Sleep

This (obviously) came with the Sing Me to Sleep compilation LP that Dean & Britta contributed the beautiful and fragile Making Me Smile for.

### [13] This Is Our Music

Another of Jenell's badges that she made for the This Music Is Ours compilation back in 2020 - this I only have one of since there were only fifty so not every copy had one included.
