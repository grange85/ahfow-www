This post might overlap somewhat with the four posts I've already written about Dean and Britta's northern sojourn but I wanted to try and get it into some sort of order and all in one place - this will be more of a diary and will probably be a bit more... off-topic. If you prefer you can read the other posts first (but hopefully this will be a little more considered!)

 - [Dean Wareham and Sea Power and Dean & Britta at Krankenhaus](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/08/25/dean-britta-at-krankenhaus/)
 - [Dean & Britta in Durham and North Shields](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/08/27/dean-britta-in-durham-and-north-shields/)

While in recent years I've been happy to travel to get in more shows rather than just waiting in London (or Whitley Bay) for bands to come to me, I don't think attending six shows in seven days was something I would have considered on purpose. It happened accidentally and over time. This is how it came about...

Shortly after Dean went home after his tour in April I came across a post informing me that Dean & Britta would be playing in Hebden Bridge. Hazel was always keen for us to spend a few days there anyway so we booked three nights with Dean & Britta's show at the end _(show 1/6)_. A couple of days later another show was announced in Durham, too close to where I lived to ignore _(show 5/6)_.

In the middle of May the bill for the [Krankenhaus Festival](https://krankenhausfestival.com/) was announced and Dean & Britta booked to play _(show 3/6)_, and also that Dean would play a set of Galaxie 500 shows backed by Sea Power _(show 2/6)_. As a warm-up/rehearsal for this Dean was then added as support to a Sea Power show in Hebden Bridge, the night before Dean & Britta's show _(show 2/6)_ - I must admit that I didn't think Hazel would be up for Krankenhaus but Indietracks-withdrawl meant she was actually quite keen.

Durham is pretty close to where we live, door to door I could be there - via foot, metro, and train - in about an hour but at the end of May yet another show was announced in North Shields _(show 6/6)_ - this one I could get to in just over 20 minutes!

## Tuesday 19th August 2025 - Whitley Bay to Hebden Bridge
After some shenanigans with the car rental that led to an unscheduled trip to Newcastle airport to collect a car, we finally left Whitley Bay a few hours behind schedule, shortly after lunch. We stopped in Ripon, put an hour on the parking and grabbed a nice lunch at [Oliver's Pantry](https://oliverspantry.com/) and then zipped round the very [impressive cathedral](https://riponcathedral.org.uk/)! Made a note that we must return for a more leisurely visit at some point!

We finally arrived in Hebden just after 6, and after we settled into our digs (a lovely, tiny back-to-back terrace) we took a stroll around the town, checked out the location of the venue, and walked briefly along the Rochdale Canal. The North East of England has no canals - I really miss canals!
{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/rochdale-canal.jpg" "The Rochdale Canal at Hebden Bridge" %}

We ate too much lovely food in [Nelson's Wine Bar](https://nelsonswinebar.co.uk/).

## Wednesday 20th August 2025
### Hebden Bridge and Heptonstall
Spent the morning wandering around Hebden some more, and then stopped for a sandwich and a coffee in [Squeeze](https://www.squeezehebden.co.uk/) - we sat down and were waiting for the food to arrive when in walked a couple of folk we knew, who'd spotted us sitting in the window.
{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/ah-db-hebden-bridge.jpg" "Dean and me / Hazel and Britta" %}

We chatted for a while before Dean and Britta headed off and we did a bit more canal walking and then hiked up the steep, steep hill to Heptonstall, walked around the church and then back down that steep, steep hill.
{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/view-from-heptonstall.jpg" "The view on the hike up to Heptonstall" %}

Exhausted, we relaxed in the house and ate rubbish pasta before the gig.

### _Show 1/6_ - Dean Wareham and Sea Power play Galaxie 500, The Trades Club
We bumped into a couple of pals on the walk to the venue, the upstairs room of a lovely hall, capacity ~200, and arrived shortly before the doors opened went in and positioned ourselves near the front, and to the left, of the stage.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/dean-wareham-sea-power-02.jpg" "Dean Wareham and Sea Power" %}

The stage was crammed with so much kit it was hard to imagine how Dean, and the whole of Sea Power were going to squeeze onto it. Shortly after eight the seven piece band took to the stage, Dean and the six members of Sea Power, and opened with Blue Thunder and settled into a short set of Galaxie 500 classics without any suggestion that they had only had one rehearsal.

The set finished with an absolutely sensational six minute version of Tugboat - with Dean sharing vocals with Sea Power’s Hamilton.

Setlist:
 - Blue Thunder
 - Strange
 - Temperature's Rising
 - Fourth of July
 - When Will You Come Home
 - Spook
 - Tugboat

I was quite overcome by the end of the show and retired to the back to watch Sea Power's set of songs mostly unfamiliar to me. For reasons I'm not entirely sure of I had stopped buying Sea Power records after The Man of Aran in 2009. Show over, we said our goodbyes to a few friends (old and new) and headed back to the house.

### Halifax
We grabbed a bowl of cereal and headed to Hebden Bridge station to get the train to Halifax for some sight-seeing. First stop was the Calderdale Industrial Museum, a fantastic museum crammed with items from Halifax's industrial past - lots of wondrously intricate contraptions for the spinning and weaving of fabrics; a wonderful [cat automaton](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wYVQWLJds-s) used back in the day to sell cat's eyes, a Halifax invention; a machine for wrapping toffees; and so many more industrial wonders!
{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/cats-eye-cat.jpg" "Cat demonstrating cat's eyes" %}

We walked to Halifax Minster and arrived in time to catch the end of an organ recital on their fantastic instrument rebuilt in the 1920s but with bits dating much earlier.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/halifax-minster-harrison-organ.jpg" "Harrison organ, Halifax Minster" %}

We wandered through Halifax's famous Piece Hall, which was being prepped for the latest in a series of concerts, and then through the more [Borough Market](https://new.calderdale.gov.uk/communities/calderdale-markets/market-halls/halifax) where we grabbed a lovely kimchi and cheese toastie at the splendid Temperance Movement, and then headed back to the station for the trip home and another rest before that evening's Dean & Britta show.

### _Show 2/6_  Dean & Britta, The Trades Club
Arrived at the Trades Club early (again) and bumped into Joe who I hadn't seen for ages. For this show the front half of the hall had been laid out with rows of chairs and when the doors opened we positioned ourselves in the front row.

First up were Deary who have been releasing lots of lovely records on Sonic Cathedral over the last couple of years although this was my first time seeing them. They were a four piece (this evening) and played a gorgeous 30 minute set of dreamy guitar wash in a dry ice cloud - beautiful.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/deary-hebden-bridge-02.jpg" "Deary - The Trades Club, Hebden Bridge" %}

The stage for Dean & Britta had been set with three high stools, one each for Dean & Britta, and one for Britta's box of drum beats, drones, and other sonic augmentations. They opened the set with their cover of The Clash's _I'm So Bored with The USA_ that first debuted during their COVID livestreams and continuted through a set that took in most of the phases of Dean's career - solo, with Britta, with Luna, and with Galaxie 500.

Setlist:
 - I’m So Bored With The USA
 - The Cloud is Coming
 - Night Nurse
 - Love is Colder Than Death
 - I’ll Keep it With Mine
 - Mystery Guest
 - Snowstorm
 - Tracy I Love You
 - Knives from Bavaria
 - Yesterday’s Hero
 - 23 Minutes in Brussels
 - Blue Thunder

They returned to the stage and were about to play Strange when someone in the audience shouted for Bonnie and Clyde and, after a bit of discussion and a false-start or two they made a brave, unrehearsed attempt at it before it beautifully fell apart after a couple of minutes. 

And then... Strange.

Show over, some chatting, some beer, and a walk back to the house.

## 22nd August 2025
### The drive to Whitehaven
We were obliged to be out of the house quite early so the car was packed up and we wandered into Hebden for breakfast at [Leila's Kitchen](https://leilaskitchen.co.uk/) before heading off on the drive first to our hotel in Whitehaven and then on to Muncaster Castle for day one of Krankenhaus.

We decided to take the scenic route through the Lake District which was, of course, very beautiful but also very full of cars and people - we bought some bread and cheese and chocolate milk, and parked up near Windermere to eat and enjoy the views:

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/windermere.jpg" "Lunch on a bench by Lake Windermere" %}

The drive ended up being longer than we expected and we arrived at our (awful) hotel in Whitehaven, rested for a bit and then drove the 30 minutes to Muncaster Castle, picked up our wristbands, and a programme, and a grabbed a coffee from the [Northumberland Coffee cart](https://northumberlandcoffee.com/) that was thankfully in place for the whole weekend and provided much needed hits over the whole weekend.

I checked out The Lovely Eggs, who were just finishing their set in The Barn, but what seemed charming at Indietracks a few years back, was just annoying now - so I headed back outside to wait for Dean's set with Sea Power that was up next.

### Show 3/6 - Dean Wareham and Sea Power play Galaxie 500
After The Lovely Eggs and The Barn had emptied somewhat I positioned myself at the front of the stage, conincidentally next to old pal Ivan who I hadn't seen since a Miracle Legion gig nine years earlier. There was more room on the Krankenhaus stage than there had been at Hebden Bridge so there was now an extra mic set up so that Britta, who had stood at the back and watched at the previous show, could join in occationally adding some vocal depth,

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/dean-and-sea-power-krankenhaus-02.jpg" "Dean and Britta with Sea Power at Krankenhaus" %}
The band arrived on stage shortly after eight and played through the same set they had in Hebden Bridge although it felt more relaxed, perhaps the reassurance of having done it without any problems a few nights previously, coupled with the festival _atmosphere_ made it that way (or seem that way). While the band played a couple of camera operators weaved in amongst, and in front of, the band so hopefully we'll see some top quality clips from the show at some point.

The show once again finished with a storming Tugboat and then it was over. The Barn emptied.

Hazel and I headed out and grabbed some food and sat by the second stage, The Glade, eating. As we did Dean and Britta passed by and stopped and sat and chatted for a while. Meanwhile DaemöniK Fonce were setting up and soundchecking on the small stage. They were described in the programme as "Pam Ayers home schooling The Cockney Rejects" - I asked Dean if he'd heard of Pam, he sadly hadn't - "why would he?" asked Hazel... but, why wouldn't he. I'm not sure he'd had the dubious joy of knowing The Cockney Rejects either.

Dean and Britta headed on as DaemöniK Fonce played their set that was reminiscent of neither Pam Ayers or The Cockney Rejects, but was an enjoyable and fun set of punky-pop, or poppy-punk.

We stuck around for The Moonlandingz who were closing up things in The Barn on day one, but lasted only about 10 minutes of their dreadful racket and headed back to the car and then the hotel.

### The Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway / Muncaster Castle / Krankenhaus

On the Saturday we grabbed breakfast on the way to the festival at [Déjà Brew](https://dejabrew.touchtakeaway.net/menu) in Egremont and ate it overlooking Nethertown station which is a barely used station seemingly in the middle of nowhere but right next to the sea. Sadly we didn't have too much time to enjoy the scenery since we'd decided to take advantage of the Krankenhaus discount on trips on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, a narrow gauge railway that takes a 40 minute journey through the beautiful West Cumbrian countryside from Ravenglass to Dalegarth. We had half an hour to fill at the halfway point before our 40 minute journey back. We walked almost to the nearby church and then looped back around to the station, eating blackberries.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/dalegarth-church.jpg" "St Catherine's Church, Dalegarth" %}

Back in Ravenglass we walked back to the festival site, past the remains of a roman bathhouse and rather than go to the festival we carried on to the castle to watch a falcon flying display and to walk around the castle grounds. There was so much to do we seemed to be doing rather little of what we had come here for!

Saturday was the day we weren't going to see Dean and Britta, although as we walked through the castle grounds we bumped into them, and walked back to the festival with them, stopping to chat to Stewart Lee on the way, well they chatted... we just smiled and said hello. As we moved on Britta asked me if I was a fan, I replied that I liked him because he was a Galaxie 500 fan!

We left Dean & Britta and headed into The Barn to catch some of Rich(ard) Dawson's set - which was OK, but after about half of it decided we'd had enough and headed out to grab some food.

Jane Weaver's set started just before nine, after some long technical delays - which meant she rattled through her lovely set with perhaps a little less of her enjoyable banter:

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/jane-weaver-krankjenhaus-02.jpg" "Jane Weaver and band" %}

Headlining day two were, obviously, Sea Power who played a considerably different, and considerably more familiar set than they had in Hebden Bridge, I couldn't help but loving the songs I was more familiar with so enjoyed this show more.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/sea-power-krankjenhaus-02.jpg" "Sea Power closing out day two of Krankenhaus" %}

We headed back to the hotel and tried to sleep.

## 24th August 2025
### Muncaster Castle Owls and some actual festival things!
Once again we grabbed breakfast at Déjà Brew and this time ate it in a car park overlooking Sellafield Nuclear Power Station, and then headed to Muncaster and to the castle's Hawk and Owl Centre to catch a display of flying owls where we, yet again, bumped into Dean and Britta. I then watched most of the Sea Power soundtracked [From The Sea to The Land Beyond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Sea_to_the_Land_Beyond) (although it wasn't live soundtracked) before heading out for ice cream and more flying birds of prey!

Back to the festival and caught a little of Kathryn Joseph, and the whole of [La Sécurité](https://www.mothland.com/la-securite) who made a very enjoyable racket:

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/la-securite-krankenhaus-01.jpg" "La Sécurité at Krankenhaus" %}

### Dean & Britta at Krankenhaus
Sunday’s set saw Dean & Britta performing once again as a duo, this time standing up! 

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/dean-and-britta-krankenhaus-02.jpg" "Dean & Britta at Krankenhaus" %}

The setlist was different from the one they had played in Hebden on Thursday… I didn’t make notes so this is from memory, so may not be in the right order and may have ommisions.

 - I’m So Bored With The USA
 - The Cloud Is Coming
 - I’ll Keep It With Mine
 - Snowstorm
 - Drive
 - Ceremony
 - Don’t Let Our Youth Go To Waste
 - 23 Minutes in Brussels

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw4-Ou70iCY

A beautiful short set - Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste was truncated because of time - but perfect despite that (and that would be fixed later in the week).

At this point we decided to end our festival - we'd have loved to have stayed for Throwing Muses but if we had we'd have been getting home at about 3am and we were both already pretty worn out so opted to finish the weekend on a perfect Dean & Britta high! We said goodbye to Britta as she headed to the merch table and headed homeward.

Since we were heading east the beautiful sunset was all in our mirrors so we decided to stop near Hadrian's Wall for a rest and to take it in although the best of it was after the sun had gone down.
