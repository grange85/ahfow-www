This post might overlap somewhat with the four posts I've already written about Dean and Britta's northern sojourn, but I wanted to try and get it into some sort of order and all in one place - this will be more of a diary and will probably be a bit more... off-topic. If you prefer, you can read the other posts first - but hopefully this will be a little more considered! Although... it'll inevitably be quite long!

While in recent years I've been happy to travel to get in more shows rather than just waiting in London (or Whitley Bay) for bands to come to me, I don't think attending six shows in seven days was something I would have considered on purpose. It happened accidentally and over time. This is how it came about...

Shortly after Dean went home after his tour in April, I came across a post informing me that Dean & Britta would be playing in Hebden Bridge. Hazel was always keen for us to spend a few days there anyway, so we booked three nights with Dean & Britta's show at the end _(show 1/6)_. A couple of days later another show was announced in Durham, too close to where I lived to ignore _(show 5/6)_.

In the middle of May, the bill for the [Krankenhaus Festival](https://krankenhausfestival.com/) was announced and Dean & Britta booked to play _(show 3/6)_, and also that Dean would play a set of Galaxie 500 shows backed by Sea Power _(show 2/6)_. As a warm-up/rehearsal for this Dean was then added as support to a Sea Power show in Hebden Bridge, the night before Dean & Britta's show _(show 2/6)_ - I must admit that I didn't think Hazel would be up for Krankenhaus but Indietracks-withdrawl meant she was actually quite keen.

Durham is pretty close to where we live, door to door I could be there - via foot, metro, and train - in about an hour, but at the end of May yet another show was announced in North Shields _(show 6/6)_ - this one I could get to in just over 20 minutes!

### Whitley Bay to Hebden Bridge
After some shenanigans with the car rental that led to an unscheduled trip to Newcastle airport to collect a car, we finally left Whitley Bay a few hours behind schedule, shortly after lunch. We stopped in Ripon, put an hour on the parking and grabbed a nice lunch at [Oliver's Pantry](https://oliverspantry.com/) and then zipped around the very [impressive cathedral](https://riponcathedral.org.uk/)! Made a note that we must return for a more leisurely visit at some point!
{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/ripon-cathedral.jpg" "Ripon Cathedral" %}

We finally arrived in Hebden just after 6, and after we settled into our digs (a lovely, tiny back-to-back terrace) we took a stroll around the town, checked out the location of the venue, and walked briefly along the Rochdale Canal. The North East of England has no canals - I really miss canals!
{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/rochdale-canal.jpg" "The Rochdale Canal at Hebden Bridge" %}

We ate too much lovely food in [Nelson's Wine Bar](https://nelsonswinebar.co.uk/).

### Hebden Bridge and Heptonstall
Spent the morning wandering around Hebden some more, and then stopped for a sandwich and a coffee in [Squeeze](https://www.squeezehebden.co.uk/) - we sat down and were waiting for the food to arrive when in walked a couple of folk we knew, who'd spotted us sitting in the window.
{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/ah-db-hebden-bridge.jpg" "Dean and me / Hazel and Britta" %}

We chatted for a while before Dean and Britta headed off and we did a bit more canal walking and then hiked up the steep, steep hill to Heptonstall, walked around the church and then back down that steep, steep hill.
{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/view-from-heptonstall.jpg" "The view on the hike up to Heptonstall" %}

Exhausted, we relaxed in the house and ate rubbish pasta before the gig.

### _Show 1/6:_ Dean Wareham and Sea Power play Galaxie 500, The Trades Club
We bumped into a Janet and Richard on the walk to the venue, the upstairs room of a lovely hall, capacity ~200, and arrived shortly before the doors opened went in and positioned ourselves near the front, and to the left, of the stage.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/dean-wareham-sea-power-02.jpg" "Dean Wareham and Sea Power" %}

The stage was crammed with so much kit it was hard to imagine how Dean and the whole of Sea Power were going to squeeze onto it. Shortly after eight, the seven-piece band took to the stage, Dean and the six members of Sea Power, and opened with Blue Thunder and settled into a short set of Galaxie 500 classics without any suggestion that they had only had one rehearsal.

The set finished with an absolutely sensational six-minute version of Tugboat - with Dean sharing vocals with Sea Power’s Hamilton.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YChAe16xiq0

Setlist:
 - Blue Thunder
 - Strange
 - Temperature's Rising
 - Fourth of July
 - When Will You Come Home
 - Spook
 - Tugboat

I was quite overcome by the end of the show and retired to the back to watch Sea Power's set of songs mostly unfamiliar to me. For reasons I'm not entirely sure of I had stopped buying Sea Power records after The Man of Aran in 2009. Show over, we said our goodbyes to a few friends (old and new) and headed back to the house.

### Halifax
We grabbed a bowl of cereal and headed to Hebden Bridge station to get the train to Halifax for some sightseeing. First stop was the Calderdale Industrial Museum, a fantastic museum crammed with items from Halifax's industrial past - lots of wondrously intricate contraptions for the spinning and weaving of fabrics; a wonderful [cat automaton](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wYVQWLJds-s) used back in the day to sell cat's eyes, a Halifax invention; a machine for wrapping toffees; and so many more industrial wonders!
{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/cats-eye-cat.jpg" "Cat demonstrating cat's eyes" %}

We walked to Halifax Minster and arrived in time to catch the end of an organ recital on their fantastic instrument, rebuilt in the 1920s but with bits dating much earlier.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/halifax-minster-harrison-organ.jpg" "Harrison organ, Halifax Minster" %}

We wandered through Halifax's famous Piece Hall, which was being prepped for the latest in a series of concerts, and then through the more beautiful [Borough Market](https://new.calderdale.gov.uk/communities/calderdale-markets/market-halls/halifax) where we grabbed a lovely kimchi and cheese toastie at the splendid [Temperance Movement](https://www.visitcalderdale.com/see-and-do/the-temperance-movement/), and then headed back to the station for the trip home and another rest before that evening's Dean & Britta show.

### _Show 2/6:_ Dean & Britta, The Trades Club
Arrived at the Trades Club early (again) and bumped into Joe who I hadn't seen for ages. For this show the front half of the hall had been laid out with rows of chairs, and when the doors opened we positioned ourselves in the front row.

First up were [Deary](https://deary.bandcamp.com/) who have been releasing lots of lovely records on [Sonic Cathedral](https://soniccathedral.co.uk/) over the last couple of years although this was my first time seeing them. They were a four-piece (this evening) and played a gorgeous 30-minute set of dreamy guitar wash in a dry ice cloud - beautiful.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/deary-hebden-bridge-02.jpg" "Deary - The Trades Club, Hebden Bridge" %}

The stage for Dean & Britta had been set with three high stools, one each for Dean & Britta, and one for Britta's box of drum beats, drones, and other sonic augmentations. They opened the set with their cover of The Clash's I'm So Bored with The USA that first debuted during their COVID livestreams and continued through a set that took in most of the phases of Dean's career - solo, with Britta, with Luna, and with Galaxie 500.

Setlist:
 - I’m So Bored With The USA
 - The Cloud is Coming
 - Night Nurse
 - Love is Colder Than Death
 - I’ll Keep it With Mine
 - Mystery Guest
 - Snowstorm
 - Tracy I Love You
 - Knives from Bavaria
 - Yesterday’s Hero
 - 23 Minutes in Brussels
 - Blue Thunder

They returned to the stage and were about to play Strange when someone in the audience shouted for Bonnie and Clyde, and after a bit of discussion and a false start or two they made a brave, unrehearsed attempt at it before it beautifully fell apart after a couple of minutes. 

And then... Strange.

Show over, some chatting, some beer, and a walk back to the house.

### Hebden Bridge to Whitehaven
We were obliged to be out of the house quite early so the car was packed up and we wandered into Hebden for breakfast at [Leila's Kitchen](https://leilaskitchen.co.uk/) before heading off on the drive first to our hotel in Whitehaven and then on to Muncaster Castle for day one of Krankenhaus.

We decided to take the scenic route through the Lake District which was, of course, very beautiful but also very full of cars and people - we bought some bread and cheese and chocolate milk, and parked up near Windermere to eat and enjoy the views:

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/windermere.jpg" "Lunch on a bench by Lake Windermere" %}

The drive ended up being longer than we expected and we arrived at our (awful) hotel in Whitehaven, rested for a bit and then drove the 30 minutes to Muncaster Castle, picked up our wristbands, and a programme, and a grabbed a coffee from the [Northumberland Coffee cart](https://northumberlandcoffee.com/) that was thankfully in place for the whole weekend and provided much needed hits over the whole weekend.

I checked out The Lovely Eggs, who were just finishing their set in The Barn, but what seemed charming at Indietracks a few years back was just annoying now - so I headed outside to wait for Dean's set with Sea Power that was up next.

### Show 3/6 - Dean Wareham and Sea Power play Galaxie 500
After The Lovely Eggs and The Barn had emptied somewhat, I positioned myself at the front of the stage, coincidentally next to old pal Ivan, who I hadn't seen since a Miracle Legion gig nine years earlier. There was more room on the Krankenhaus stage than there had been at Hebden Bridge so there was now an extra mic set up so that Britta, who had stood at the back and watched at the previous show, could join in occasionally adding some vocal depth.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/dean-and-sea-power-krankenhaus-02.jpg" "Dean and Britta with Sea Power at Krankenhaus" %}
The band arrived on stage shortly after eight and played through the same set they had in Hebden Bridge, although it felt more relaxed, perhaps the reassurance of having done it without any problems a few nights previously, coupled with the festival _atmosphere_ made it that way (or seem that way). While the band played, a couple of camera operators weaved in amongst, and in front of, them so hopefully we'll see some top quality clips from the show at some point.

The show once again finished with a storming Tugboat, and then it was over. The Barn emptied.

Hazel and I headed out and grabbed some food and sat by the second stage, The Glade, eating. As we did Dean and Britta passed by and stopped and sat and chatted for a while. Meanwhile, DaemöniK Fonce were setting up and soundchecking on the small stage. They were described in the programme as "Pam Ayers home schooling The Cockney Rejects" - I asked Dean if he'd heard of Pam, he sadly hadn't - "why would he?" asked Hazel... but, why wouldn't he. I'm not sure he'd had the dubious joy of knowing The Cockney Rejects either.

Dean and Britta headed on as DaemöniK Fonce played their set that was reminiscent of neither Pam Ayers nor The Cockney Rejects, but was an enjoyable set of punky-pop, or poppy-punk.

We stuck around for The Moonlandingz who were closing up things in The Barn on day one, but lasted only about 10 minutes of their dreadful racket and headed back to the car and then the hotel.

### The Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway / Muncaster Castle / Krankenhaus

On the Saturday, we grabbed breakfast on the way to the festival at [Déjà Brew](https://dejabrew.touchtakeaway.net/menu) in Egremont and ate it overlooking Nethertown station which is a barely used station seemingly in the middle of nowhere but right next to the sea. Sadly we didn't have too much time to enjoy the scenery since we'd decided to take advantage of the Krankenhaus discount on trips on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway, a narrow gauge railway that takes a 40 minute journey through the beautiful West Cumbrian countryside from Ravenglass to Dalegarth. We had half an hour to fill at the halfway point before our 40 minute journey back. We walked almost to the nearby church and then looped back around to the station, eating blackberries.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/dalegarth-church.jpg" "St Catherine's Church, Dalegarth" %}

Back in Ravenglass we walked back to the festival site, past the remains of a roman bathhouse and rather than go to the festival we carried on to the castle to watch a falcon flying display and to walk around the castle grounds. There was so much to do we seemed to be doing rather little of what we had come here for!

Saturday was the day we weren't going to see Dean and Britta, although as we walked through the castle grounds we bumped into them, and walked back to the festival with them, stopping to chat to Stewart Lee on the way, well they chatted... we just smiled and said hello. As we moved on Britta asked me if I was a fanof his, I replied that I liked him because he was a Galaxie 500 fan!

We left Dean & Britta and headed into The Barn to catch some of Rich(ard) Dawson's set - which was OK, but after about half of it decided we'd had enough and headed out to grab some food.

Jane Weaver's set started just before nine, after some long technical delays - which meant she rattled through her lovely set with perhaps a little less of her enjoyable banter:

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/jane-weaver-krankjenhaus-02.jpg" "Jane Weaver and band" %}

Headlining day two were, obviously, Sea Power who played a considerably different, and considerably more familiar set than they had in Hebden Bridge, I couldn't help but love the songs I was more familiar with so enjoyed this show more.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/sea-power-krankjenhaus-02.jpg" "Sea Power closing day two of Krankenhaus" %}

We headed back to the hotel and tried to sleep.

### Muncaster Castle Owls and some actual festival things!
Once again we grabbed breakfast at Déjà Brew and this time ate it in a car park overlooking Sellafield Nuclear Power Station, and then headed to Muncaster and to the castle's Hawk and Owl Centre to catch a display of flying owls where we, yet again, bumped into Dean and Britta. I then watched most of the Sea Power soundtracked [From The Sea to The Land Beyond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Sea_to_the_Land_Beyond) (although it wasn't live soundtracked) before heading out for ice cream and more flying birds of prey!

Back to the festival and caught a little of Kathryn Joseph, and the whole of [La Sécurité](https://www.mothland.com/la-securite) who made a very enjoyable racket:

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/la-securite-krankenhaus-01.jpg" "La Sécurité at Krankenhaus" %}

### _Show 4/6:_ Dean & Britta at Krankenhaus
Sunday’s set saw Dean & Britta performing once again as a duo, this time standing up! 

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/august-2025/dean-and-britta-krankenhaus-02.jpg" "Dean & Britta at Krankenhaus" %}

The setlist was different from the one they had played in Hebden on Thursday… I didn’t make notes so this is from memory, so may not be in the right order and may have ommisions.

 - I’m So Bored With The USA
 - The Cloud Is Coming
 - I’ll Keep It With Mine
 - Snowstorm
 - Drive
 - Ceremony
 - Don’t Let Our Youth Go To Waste
 - 23 Minutes in Brussels

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw4-Ou70iCY

A beautiful short set - Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste was truncated because of time - but perfect despite that (and that would be fixed later in the week).

At this point we decided to end our festival - we'd have loved to have stayed for Throwing Muses but if we had we'd have been getting home at about 3am and we were both already pretty worn out so opted to finish the weekend on a perfect Dean & Britta high! We said goodbye to Britta as she headed to the merch table and headed homeward.

Since we were heading east, the beautiful sunset was all in our mirrors so we decided to stop near Hadrian's Wall for a rest and to take it in although the best of it was after the sun had gone down.

### _Show 5/6:_ Dean & Britta at The Holy GrAle in Durham

Durham was the only show that Hazel decided to skip (she says she's not really a fan but five shows in six days would suggest otherwise), so early on Monday evening I headed to Durham alone. Newcastle United were playing Liverpool in the city that evening and, since everyone in the area only supports one club, the Metro was already packed with supporters heading to the match, early. The train to Durham from Newcastle takes a little over 10 minutes, and the walk from the station to the venue not much more, so I found myself outside the venue 30 minutes before the doors opened.

A look around revealed two pubs close by, The Angel - a metal bar with, according to Google reviews, an excellent jukebox and a more traditional hostelry [Ye Old Elm Tree](https://www.instagram.com/yeoldelmtreedurham/) - the latter seemed a better bet to find some other fans and, sure enough, Joakin and Ulrika were in the room at the back. I grabbed a half and we filled the time until the doors opened.

The Holy GrAle is more a pub than a venue. The stage, which isn't a stage, was at the front corner of the pub - behind which were windows onto the street outside. A few rows of chairs had been laid out and these were mostly unoccupied when we arrived... so, we occupied them.

As with the two previous shows, Dean & Britta opened their set with The Clash's _I'm So Bored With The USA_ and then played a lovely, longer, and more varied set than before. They were very relaxed and seemed to be enjoying the show.

The setlist - again based mostly on my memory... and I'd had a couple of halves so unreliable!

 - I'm So Bored With The USA
 - We're Not Finished Yet
 - Knives from Bavaria
 - The Cloud is Coming 
 - Night Nurse 
 - I'll Keep it With Mine
 - 23 Minutes in Brussels
 - Love is Colder than Death
 - Drive
 - Blue Thunder
 - Yesterday's Hero
 - Friendly Advice
 - Tugboat

They then retired backstage, or the street outside the pub as it's known at The Holy GrAle before returning to the stage to encore with Bonnie and Clyde, which had clearly been worked on since the Hebden Bridge show on Thursday and they finished, once again, with Galaxie 500's Strange after a request from the audience.

Show over, and socialising done I headed back home, first on the train to Newcastle, and then on the Metro to Whitley Bay. The Metro was packed with Newcastle supporters heading home from the match, late.

## Tuesday, 26th August 2025
### Fish, chips, and ice cream
On Tuesday morning I received a message from Dean asking me if I could recommend a fish and chip shop in the area and I pointed him at the best chips in Whitley Bay - I was unable to pass opinion on the fish - I did also give him the option of the [chip shop in Tynemouth where Jimi Hendrix had eaten](https://www.loudersound.com/features/jimi-hendrix-newcastle-fish-chips). 

At 12:30 Hazel and I met Dean and Britta outside Fisherman's Bay and sat on the prom eating our lunch. When the North Shields show was announced I suggested that they shouldn't leave the North East without sampling the finest gelato in the area (or second finest according to Hazel) so after we'd finished our (fish and) chips, we headed to [Di Meos]() for ice cream 

{% ahfowimage "url" "caption" %}

We then walk along the front to the Rendezvous, and then back along the beach where Britta decided to have a [plodge](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/plodge_v?tab=factsheet&tl=true#29665421)

{% ahfowimage "url" "caption" %}

Dean and Britta then headed back to their hotel to rest and prepare for the show, and Hazel and I back to our house to do the same.

Chris got in touch that afternoon asking if there were any plans to meet before the show. There weren't, so I hastily got one together, picking the Low Lights Tavern around the corner from the venue. I took the Metro to Tynemouth and then walked past Knott's Flats and along the Tyne to the meeting - Hazel had decided to pass on this and would meet us at the venue later.

As I arrived at the pub Joakim and Ulrika were getting out of their Uber, and Chris was already in the pub having arrived early to eat. Paul arrived as did (another) Chris and Sara and we jawed for a while and then walked up to the venue.

### _Show 6/6:_ Dean & Britta at The Engine Room, North Shields

The Engine Room is a lovely venue with a small, low stage at one end, a small bar at the other, and an open space between for standing in between. There were a few high stolls around the edge so we acquired a couple of those and waited. Support was from Lucas Renney, as it had been the night before in Durham, who played a short set of love songs. or love-gone-bad songs on an electric guitar.

Dean & Britta, perhaps being aware at the not inconsiderable number of folk who had been at the previous night’s show in Durham, played a very different set. Opening with Mystery Guest and Dear Betty Baby from Dean’s latest album, followed by He Dines Out on Death from Quarantine Tapes, and then more picks from catalogues of Dean solo, Dean & Britta, Luna and Galaxie 500. The set finished with Blue Thunder, and an astounding Don’t Let Our Youth Go to Waste expanding on the truncated version they'd played at Krankenhaus.

Without bothering to leave the stage Dean asked if anyone had any requests and someone called out for The Sun is Still Sunny - thank you who ever did that - and despite not having prepared it the song was worked out on stage and beautifully performed. They then played Ceremony - and that was it! An exquisite end to an evening right up there with the best.

I hung around for a while chatting before walking up to Tynemouth to get the Metro home and to wait for the next time Dean & Britta head our way.

It was a fabulous week - thanks of course to Dean and Britta - but also thanks to the many other fans who came to say hello, I've mentioned a few but there were plenty more and you were all part of a fabulous week. Until next time...
