This post might overlap somewhat with the four posts I've already written about Dean and Britta's northern sojourn but I wanted to try and get it into some sort of order and all in one place - this will be more of a diary and will probably be a bit more... off-topic. If you prefer you can read the other posts first (but hopefully this will be a little more considered!)

While in recent years I've been happy to travel to get in more shows rather than just waiting in London (or Whitley Bay) for bands to come to me, I don't think attending six shows in seven days was something I would have considered on purpose. It happened accidentally and over time. This is how it came about...

Shortly after Dean went home after his tour in April I came across a post informing me that Dean & Britta would be playing in Hebden Bridge. Hazel was always keen for us to spend a few days there anyway so we booked three nights with Dean & Britta's show at the end _(show 1/6)_. A couple of days later another show was announced in Durham, too close to where I lived to ignore _(show 5/6)_.

In the middle of May the bill for the Krankenhaus Festival was announced and Dean & Britta booked to play _(show 3/6)_, and also that Dean would play a set of Galaxie 500 shows backed by Sea Power _(show 2/6)_. As a warm-up/rehearsal for this Dean was then added as support to a Sea Power show in Hebden Bridge, the night before Dean & Britta's show _(show 2/6)_ - I must admit that I didn't think Hazel would be up for Krankenhaus but Indietracks-withdrawl meant she was actually quite keen.

Durham is pretty close to where we live, door to door I could be there - via foot, metro, and train - in about an hour but at the end of May yet another show was announced in North Shields _(show 6/6)_ - this one I could get to in just over 20 minutes!

## Tuesday 19th August 2025 - Whitley Bay to Hebden Bridge
After some shenanigans with the car rental that led to an unscheduled trip to Newcastle airport to collect a car, we finally left Whitley Bay a few hours behind schedule, shortly after lunch. We stopped in Ripon, put an hour on the parking and grabbed a nice lunch at Oliver's Pantry and then zipped round the very impressive cathedral! Made a note that we must return for a more leisurely visit at some point!

We finally arrived in Hebden just after 6, and after we settled into our digs (a lovely, tiny back-to-back terrace) we took a stroll around the town, checked out the location of the venue, and walked briefly along the Rochdale Canal. The North East of England has no canals - I really miss canals!

We ate too much lovely food in Nelson's Wine Bar.

### Hebden Bridge and Heptonstall
Spent the morning wandering around Hebden some more, and then stopped for a sandwich and a coffee in Squeeze - we sat down and were waiting for the food to arrive when in walked a couple of folk we knew, who'd spotted us sitting in the window.

We chatted for a while before Dean and Britta headed off and we did a bit more canal walking and then hiked up the steep, steep hill to Heptonstall, walked around the church and then back down that steep, steep hill.

Exhausted, we relaxed in the house and ate rubbish pasta before the gig.

### _Show 1/6_ - Dean Wareham and Sea Power play Galaxie 500, The Trades Hall
We bumped into a couple of pals on the walk to the venue, the upstairs room of a lovely hall, capacity ~200, and arrived shortly before the doors opened went in and positioned ourselves near the front, and to the left, of the stage.

The stage was crammed with so much kit it was hard to imagine how Dean, and the whole of Sea Power were going to squeeze onto it. Shortly after eight the seven piece band took to the stage, Dean and the six members of Sea Power, and opened with Blue Thunder and settled into a short set of Galaxie 500 classics without any suggestion that they had only had one rehearsal.

The set finished with an absolutely sensational six minute version of Tugboat - with Dean sharing vocals with Sea Powerâ€™s Hamilton.

I was quite overcome by the end of the show and retired to the back to watch Sea Power's set of songs mostly unfamiliar to me. For reasons I'm not entirely sure of I had stopped buying Sea Power records after The Man of Aran in 2009. Show over, we said our goodbyes to a few friends (old and new) and headed back to the house.

### Halifax
We grabbed a bowl of cereal and headed to Hebden Bridge station to get the train to Halifax for some sight-seeing. First stop was the Calderdale Industrial Museum, a fantastic museum crammed with items from Halifax's industrial past - lots of wondrously intricate contraptions for the spinning and weaving of fabrics; a wonderful [cat automaton](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wYVQWLJds-s) used back in the day to sell cat's eyes, a Halifax invention; a machine for wrapping toffees; and so many more industrial wonders!

We walked to Halifax Minster and arrived in time to catch the end of an organ recital on their fantastic instrument rebuilt in the 1920s but with bits dating much earlier.

We wandered through Halifax's famous Piece Hall, which was being prepped for the latest in a series of concerts, and then through the more [Borough Market](https://new.calderdale.gov.uk/communities/calderdale-markets/market-halls/halifax) where we grabbed a lovely kimchi and cheese toastie at the splendid Temperance Movement, and then headed back to the station for the trip home and another rest before that evening's Dean & Britta show.
