_I'm not sure that I have enough content to warrant this post, but since it's 35 years since I last saw them it seemed odd not to commemorate it in some way, so... here goes..._

On the 1st November 1990, 35 years ago this week, Galaxie 500 started their final UK tour, over the next two weeks they played twelve shows around the country finishing up at ULU in London where I saw the band for the last time.

The tour started at the Riverside in Newcastle (in the North East of England) - I moved to the NE in 2021 by which time The Riverside had been long closed - although I did a sort of pilgrimage, there was a plaque -
