_I'm not sure that I have enough content to warrant this post, but since it's 35 years since I last saw Galaxie 50Galaxie 500 it seemed odd not to commemorate it in some way, so... here goes..._

On the 1st November 1990, 35 years ago this week, Galaxie 500 started their final UK tour, over the next two weeks they played twelve shows around the country finishing up at ULU in London where I saw the band for the last time.

### 1st November 1990 - Riverside, Newcastle

The tour started at the Riverside in Newcastle (in the North East of England) - I moved to the NE in 2021 by which time The Riverside had been long closed - although I did a sort of pilgrimage, there was a plaque:

There are a couple of recordings of this show doing the rounds here's their second encore:

### 4th November 1990 - Dance Factory, Dundee

I have nothing for this except that this is, to the best of my knowledge, the only time that Galaxie 500, or anyone who was ever in Galaxie 500, has played in Dundee. I'd like to hope that if it ever came to pass that I was living in or near Dundee that might change.

### 5th November 1990 - Liverpool, Polytechnic

It seems that Rough Trade had shelled out the train fare to send the inkies journos to Liverpool since the show was reviewed in both the NME and the Melody Maker a couple of weeks later:

<blockquote>
They've got one beautiful song, and the fact that they repeat it again and again doesn't make it any less effective. It just makes it easier to lose yourself in the gentle layers of their dreamy whirlpool of sound.

<blockquote>
There's something very real about Galaxie 500, about hearing this incredible sound coming from these fragile, almost timid people... Dean, wistful in blue light; Naomi, swaying gently in crazy earrings, her fluid basslines defining the sound as much as Peter Hook's did Joy Division or Wobble's did PiL. Think of their antecedents - "Atmosphere", "Candy Says", "After The Goldrush" - and think how wonderful it is that in 1990 amid all the chaos in the world a band can still sound so untainted, so human.
</blockquote>

God, I miss being able to read prose like that week in and week out! There's a postcard from Dean to Damon and Naomi from when he was over doing press in August 1989 where he writes "But these weeklies are more than a little ridiculous" - and they were, beautifully so!

### 7th November 1990 - Leicester University

I have nothing for this show either, so... I'll cheat! They did play at the same venue 9 months earlier supporting The Sundays, that show was caught on video.

Kramer joins them for the encore, he was with them for the tour in November but I think mostly kept to his place at the soundboard.

### 9th November 1990 - Waterfront, Norwich

Sorry, I have nothing for this show either... I can't even shoehorn anything in. Dean was scheduled to play a _plays Galaxie 500_ show at the Waterfront in 2020 (and I had plans to go) but COVID killed that show and it was one that never got rescheduled.

### 10th November 1990 - Leadmill, Sheffield

After the Dean Wareham show in Leeds earlier this year Janet came and introduced herself and mentioned that she had some photos from shows that Galaxie 500 played in Sheffield back in 1990, taken by her pal Scragga. A couple of weeks later these beauties turned up.

A while later a fat envelope turned up with prints so... they're now in "the museum"!

### 11th November 1990 - Bierkeller, Bristol

Nothing from this show but here's Dean and Damon playing The Bierkeller in February 1990 supporting The Sundays:

### 13th November 1990 - Goldwyns, Birmingham
