### Angel Corpus Christi - Louie Louie (CD)

Louie Louie is Angel Corpus Christi's album of songs "by, for, and about Lou Reed" and includes her duet with Dean Wareham on _I Want to Boogie With You/Je t'aime_ that was previously released on a couple of 7" singles.

It also has Dean and Britta guesting on a cover of Femme Fatale, a song that Angel seems to visit at regular intervals (I wrote about [Femme Fatale in a recent Substack post](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/the-velvet-undergrounds-femme-fatale)), having been on her excellent I&#9825;NY album in 1985, and a solo accordion version on 2003's Accordion Pop Volume 1. The version on Louie Louie also has Sonic Boom performing and producing and is lovely... as is the whole album and it, like a lot of Angel's catalogue, can be bought for peanuts on her Bandcamp.

After that Substack post I got an email from Angel giving a little insight into the version of Femme Fatale that appears on Louie Louie:

<blockquote>
I dont always love every song I have recorded but I DO love FF… a lot!  Best of all was the surprise of D and B contributing, I had only asked Sonic Boom to mix, I was swept off my feet when this version showed up! 
</blockquote>

It is a very, very beautiful version... prepare to be swept off your feet!

I bought this CD, along with Accordion Pop, via mail order from Glasgow shop Volcanic Tongue in 2005. Volcanic Tongue was run by David Keenan and his wife Heather Leigh and when I bought the CDs Heather wrote "these CDs are so great, we're big Angel fans here". 

I have recently been reading my way through a collection of David Keenan's writings, also called Volcanic Tongue, which is a really good read, I've not read any of his fiction but do also own the soundtrack to the play of his novel Memorial Device which was by Stephen Pastel and Gavin Thompson. I'll get round to reading Memorial Device some time!

This is Angel's fourth entry in this series, and there is (currently) still one to come... although I'm still looking to fill a gap so hopefully two more to come!

### Damon & Naomi + Ghost - Hallowe''en 2000 (MC)

This is a recording of Damon & Naomi with Ghost from Hallowe'en 2000 that someone (possibly Bob) sent me way back when we used to share cassettes rather than CDs! The sleeve is a photocopy of the appropriately seasonal poster from the show.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/damon-and-naomi-ghost-halloween-2000.jpg" "Damon & Naomi with Ghost - Hallowe'en 2000" %}

I was never a particularly good tape trader, and as soon as I could digitised all my cassettes and disposed of a lot of them. This one likely survived because of the sleeve.

It's a nice recording of Damon & Naomi playing with Ghost-ly augmentations - there are some lovely wind additions, most notably during Eye of The Storm.

### Luna Bandbox orders being honoured for a shipping and handling charge

If you placed an order for the Luna live albums that Bandbox put up for sale a couple of years back, you can now, finally, get some resolution. 

Vinylbox are honouring the orders if you're happy to pay a shipping and handling charge.

The fulfillment company are based in the UK and the charge is în GBP and is £11.29 although I believe the US orders will be shipped from the US.

To make a claim you will need to [fill in an online form](https://luna.bandbox.sucks/LRwgkN) and will need your Bandbox order number and the last four digits of the card you used (PayPal orders are also accommodated).

I filled in the form and got an invoice within an hour and it all seemed to go smoothly, although I'll confirm that when I have the records! 

Hopefully this frustrating debacle is finally coming to an end.
