Back in May I wrote about the first months of COVID in 2020 and how important Dean and Britta's live streamed shows had been during that scary and difficult time. I finished that post with their third live-streamed show at the end of June this post will pick up where I left off.

By July we were all slowly becoming experts at living in the COVID age. The governemt had relaxed the rules and people were allowed to travel and make visits... maybe the end was in sight? Perhaps it'd all be over and we could return to normality.

On the 10th July Dean posted a teased the release of a lathe-cut single containing covers of The Bee Gee's Massachusetts and The Incredible String Band's Air:

... that day they also announced that they'd be playing another concert from their living room at the end of the month, and this time at a sensible time for the folk on this side of the pond.

On the 15th July it was my dad's 80th birthday and before COVID he'd been talking about a party (possibly even two parties, my dad is very popular!) but the virus came along and kicked all of that into touch. My sister decided it would be a good idea if all of the family would make their way down to Arundel and we'd have a little surprise get-together. So Hazel, Adam and myself - fully tested and masked up - made our way down from London to West Sussex. my sister and her family made their way down from the NE. and my brother and his partner from Middlesex.

We surprised my dad at a local park, walked around the lake and took lots of family pics and then stood outside his house and had a small COVID-age party.

Possibly the biggest surprise might have been just how ridiculous my COVID-moustache had become!

On the 19th July I shaved!

### Live stream #4 - 24th July 2020 - Veeps

_This is the review I posted the following day to AHFoW._

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/50154779017/in/album-72157715243203528/" title="Britta looks"><img src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/flickr-downloads/50154779017_82fc0028ba_c.jpg" alt="Britta looks"></a>

Last night Dean & Britta played their ~~third~~ fourth live streamed concert since lockdown and the first one at a sensible time for European fans. For this one they also roped in Roger Brogan to help with the sound and to play drums.

<div class="col-md-6 float-right"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/50154553211/in/album-72157715243203528/" title="Dean calls the helpdesk"><img src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/flickr-downloads/50154553211_b1bbab649e_z.jpg" alt="Dean calls the helpdesk"></a></div>

The duo have decided to used the Veeps platform for the concerts which consensus seems to suggest was a wise decision as the sound quality is pretty good although for the first ten minutes of last night's performance you wouldn't have known that as the show started without sound. After a couple of minutes of their opener the message that the only people who could hear the show were the three folk in D&B's living room the event ground to a halt. With some knob twiddling and a call to tech support things were finally resolved and the concert restarted with My Rifle, My Pony and Me from [Dean and Cheval Sombre's album of cowboy songs](/database/dean-and-britta/dean-wareham-releases/dean-wareham-vs-cheval-sombre/) from a couple of years back.

Once the sound was restored it became clear that this show was a step-up from previous ones, the addition of drums and Roger's hand at the engineering wheel was certainly making a difference - next up was Galaxie 500's Leave The Planet followed by Opal's Hear The Wind Blow.

The set continued with a run of Galaxie 500 tracks with Dean & Britta's You Turned My Head Around slotted in the middle (always a joy to hear and see Britta during that one). Dean also gave a couple of poetry readings and threw in some banter and told some stories.

Among the Galaxie 500 tracks was a beautiful rendition of Sorry - written by Damon and a heartbreaking insight into a band crumbling - "Seems it doesn't make a difference,  and were sorry all the time" - it was beautiful to hear and probably hasn't been performed live by any former Galaxie 500 members since their last tour in 1991 - the late [Tom Rapp covered it at a Terrastock show back in 1998](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2018/02/12/tom-rapp-1947-2018/).

The show finished with an _encore_ of a cover of Donovan's Sadness and then a perfect Ceremony.

<div class="col-md-6 float-right"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/50154544056/in/album-72157715243203528/" title="B-a-a-a-a-b-y"><img src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/flickr-downloads/50154544056_abd8eaa781_z.jpg" alt="B-a-a-a-a-b-y"></a></div>

Definitely the best of the three shows so far - and an absolute joy to see them live. The Veeps platform has a _chat_ that was quite active during the show and was nice to have some level of interaction with other fans... lovely to _see_ so many familiar _faces_ in there.

The one thing that was really missed was band/audience and inter-audience feedback.

- the band tried to keep an eye on the chat but it clearly isn't possible in any meaningful way - the delays and the silence of it mean that they aren't really reacting at all - this was most blatantly clear during the silent rendtion of the opening track - the fact that it took two minutes before Dean & Britta realised that nobody could hear was telling.
- audience interaction with each other, while better, was also hard. Chat went past too quickly at times - the Veeps platform didn't allow @ comments or private comments or for the audience to break into smaller groups (not sure if this would work at all).
- the inability to actually hear an audience made things feel a little off, it's almost as if you want a second stream so the audience and the band could see and hear each other - again not sure how/if this would work but I missed that probably more than anything else - I'm not a social person but I do miss being among fans!

At the end of the month I cycled into work for the first time since the shit-show started... although it wasn't really _work_ we just sat in the TNA pocket park eating, and catching up - it was nice to be among my work colleagues again... although, clearly we were all keeping our distance. I assume that things had started to go bad again!
