## [271] Various artists - Mint Humbucker (CD)

Mint Humbucker was a compilation released in 2001 purportedly to celebrate it's 11th (!) anniversary but also to flag its shortlived ressurection. Dean Wareham touches a few of the contributions.

Mint was launched in 1991 and it's first release (on it's _Mint Sauce_ imprint) was Justin Harwood's studio project Mutton Gun's first album Amplexus on which Dean Wareham appeared and has [previously been visited in this series](/2025/01/13/my-record-collection-mutton-gun-amplexus-lp/). Dean doesn't play on the one track from Amplexus on this compilation and the other two Mutton Gun tracks are from their second album _Into The Hogger_ which Dean (probably) didn't play on... but did it did have [DEAN WHERE ARE YOU?](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/mutton-gun-into-the-hogger-runout-groove.jpg) scratched into the run out grooves.

Mint also was the first home of Mercury Rev whose first album was released on its _Mint Films_ imprint, it later released the _Car Wash Hair_ single that featured Dean Wareham and is included on this compilation, and also has [appeared in this series](/2024/05/27/my-record-collection-139-mercury-rev-car-wash-hair/).

And, of course, Dean Wareham's first post-Luna release _Anesthesia_ was released on Mint's _Mint Tea_ imprint, this compilation has Anesthesia, and Tomato Poodle which was only ever released on the Mint version of the Anesthesia single, and on this compilation. I've written about both the [CD version](/2023/07/13/my-record-collection-051-dean-wareham-anesthesia/) and the [12" version](/2023/09/14/my-record-collection-069-dean-wareham-anesthesia/) for this series.

Mint were selling this compilation cheaply for ages through their website, and then through Discogs, and you can still pick up copies for almost nothing and it's worth it for all the above... and the Radial Spangle tracks it also includes.

## [272] Dean Wareham - Indian Summer (split single)

There were two releases credited to _Dean Wareham_ that were released during Galaxie 500's lifetime, both in 1990, I'm not sure which came out first but I think that Dean's solo outings added to the problems that were already tearing the band apart. This is a cover of Beat Happening's Indian Summer that would later be recorded by, and become a live staple of, Luna.

The single is a 33rpm 7" that was released with Mike McGonigal's Chemical Imbalance fanzine (Vol.2 No.2), I don't have a copy of the magazine and I'm not sure there was any actual Dean/Galaxie content apart from the track on the single (or at least <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/chemical-imbalance-2-2.jpg">none is implied on the cover</a>). Dean's Beat Happening cover is followed on the single by Beat Happening playing Foggy Eyes (a different version than the one on their debut album) and the other three tracks on the EP are from Shimmy Disc Alumni Bongwater, Uncle Wiggly, and The Tinklers.

As often happens, listening to a Beat Happening song sends me down a BH rabbit hole - one of my fave clips on YouTube has been of Beat Happening playing _Cry For a Shadow_ on the street outside a record shop in Memphis and this time I discovered that [someone has uploaded the whole of that show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95XbTgEfSRY) - it's digitised from a VHS tape so neither the sound nor the vision is all that great, although that seems to matter less with Beat Happening, and there's something very beautiful about watching Memphis life go on around them.
