I suddenly realised that I seem to have a lot of albums paid for, but not yet arrived and since most of my purchases are by bands that have come onto my radar because of AHFoW I've decided that this is also relevant so... forgive my indulgence but these are the albums I'm looking forward to that I think you might also like to give a listen to...

## Galaxie 500 - CBGB 13th December 1988&dagger;

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/sleeves/g500-cbgb-13th-december-1988.jpg" "Galaxie 500 - CBGB 13th December 1988" %}

Well obviously this is on my list - due for release on Friday, but since my copy was one of the limited editions with the 7" single, it is coming from the US so likely to be delayed and possibly intercepted by the revenue! 

The show has been doing the rounds as a bootleg for many years but is now getting a well deserved _proper_ release via [Silver Current](https://silvercurrent.bandcamp.com/) who released last years expanded [Uncollected](https://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/album/uncollected-noise-new-york-88-90).

Recorded at legendary NYC venue at a benefit show for the fanzine shop [See Hear](https://animalnewyork.com/2024/11/18/the-oral-history-of-see-hear-nycs-underground-zine-mecca/) and was recorded and mixed by Kramer. A [review of the gig in Conflict](https://i0.wp.com/animalnewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Benefit-show-review-by-Gerard-Cosloy-from-Conflict-Fanzine_animal.jpg?resize=768%2C889&ssl=1) had this to say about Galaxie 500's appearance:

<blockquote>
Galaxie 500 were slow, meditative, tense but no[t] angry, and awfully good, thought they might as well be on auto-pilot for all the emotion they show.

## Tacoma Radar - No One Waved Goodbye

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/tacoma-radar-collection.jpg" "My (current) Tacoma Radar collection" %}

I mentioned this briefly a couple of weeks back but I am particularly excited that this lovely 2004 album is getting a deluxe 2xLP vinyl release - I think it was only released on CD before. Tacoma Radar were a short-lived band but Rich from the band was on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List at the time so, they were unable to pass us by unnoticed. I saw them once (although I actually only caught the end of their set) supporting Camera Obscura at The Spitz in London around the time of release.

Released on 26th September and available to buy from
 - [Numero Group](https://numerogroup.com/products/no-one-waved-goodbye)
 - Monorail has a lovely limited [Glasgow School edition](https://monorailmusic.com/product/no-one-waved-goodbye/?mc_cid=c4d74a018b) which remarkably hasn't sold out yet!?

## Gulp - Beneath Strawberry Moons

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/gulp-beneath-strawberry-moons.jpg" "Gulp - Beneath Strawberry Moons" %}

I first encountered Gulp as they released their first album on Dean's (then) UK label Sonic Cathedral in 2014. Beneath Strawberry Moons is their third album and the three pre-release tracks so far are as beautiful as their previous work. The band are Guto Pryce of Super Furry Animals and Lindsey Leven. I saw them play a lovely show on release of their first album at St Pancras Old Church, and another at Wales Goes Pop in 2017.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/gulp-wgp-2017.jpg" "Gulp (Wales Goes Pop, 2017)" %}

Released on 29th August and [available from Gulp's Bandcamp](https://gulp1.bandcamp.com/album/beneath-strawberry-moons) and all good record shops!

## Lorelle Meets The Obsolete - Corporal

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/lmto-corporal.jpg" "Lorelle Meets The Obsolete - Corporal" %}

Another band I discovered thanks to Sonic Cathedral, Lorelle Meets The Obsolete are a noisy/psych/rock band who have released a stack of records and this is I think going to be more of the same - and that's fine. I first saw them live at Corsica Studios in London in 2017, and most recently at The Cluny in Newcastle in 2023.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/lmto-cluny-2023.jpg" "Lorelle Meets The Obsolete (Newcastle, 2023)" %}

Released on 10th October and [available from Lorelle Meets The Obsolete's Bandcamp](https://obsoletelorelle.bandcamp.com/album/corporal) and all good record shops!

## Sister Ray Davies - Holy Island

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/sisterraydavies-holyisland.jpg" "Sister Ray Davies - Holy Island" %}

And, another Sonic Cathedral release. I wasn't sure about this one but got suckered in by the oddness of a band from "Muscle Shoals, Alabama" (which I'd only ever heard of because of the famous recording studio there) recording an album about something so very English (and quite local to me) as Holy Island. Adam from the band explained it in a Sonic Cathedral newsletter:

<blockquote>
We played in Newcastle and decided to drive along the coast to get into Scotland. I suddenly saw a castle or fort looking thing across the water and dove into Wikipedia and discovered I was looking at Lindisfarne [...] The story of Lindisfarne gave us a framework for what were otherwise very abstract ideas and emotions. It became a way to make sense of our own moment in history.
</blockquote>
