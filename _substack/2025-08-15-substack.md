## Galaxie 500 live compilation (VHS)

Back in January 2024 Andrew mentioned that a friend of his was looking to off-load some Galaxie 500 memorabilia and asked if I'd be interested... which of course I was, as well as a couple of posters there was this VHS that contained the three videos of full concerts from UK shows.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-video-compilation-vhs.jpg" "Galaxie 500 video compilation VHS" %}

I have to admit that I sometimes get these posts ready ahead of time... and  had started to write this one before I'd bought that [charity shop VHS player](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/07/03/video-galaxie-500-at-subterania-27th-june-1990/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250815) and so am now having to re-write it... while sitting and actually watching it - so I can now accurately report what is on the tape.

As listed on the photocopied sleeve the three shows are:

### Live at the University of london (U. L. U.) 13.6.90. Superb Quality - Full concert 70m.

This was such _superb quality_ that it got officially released on the [Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste DVD](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/11/11/my-record-collection-187-don-t-let-our-youth-go-to-waste-dvd/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250815) a few years back. It also might have [put in an appearance in this series on a VHS](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/01/30/my-record-collection-galaxie-500-university-of-london-6-3-90/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250815) before, but no VHS player when I wrote that meant I couldn't be sure. I was at this gig.

### Live at Leicester University 6.2.90 (As support to Birdland). Full concert 30 minutes.

This was actually supporting The Sundays, it seems Birdland played the same venue the following night so that may be where the confusion lies. This was shared again a couple of years ago described as _unknown date and unknown venue_ which was briefly quite exciting until it was identified as a boot that had been doing the rounds for many years!

### Live at Subteranea, London 27.6.90, Full concert 70 minutes.

This is actually the Manchester show that has been shared incorrectly as the London one before - I posted what is probably/hopefully the [actual Subterania show](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/07/03/video-galaxie-500-at-subterania-27th-june-1990/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250815) a couple of months back.

## The Shimmy Disc Compilation Volume 1 (VHS)

The second VHS in a row, and now that I [actually have a VHS player](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/07/03/video-galaxie-500-at-subterania-27th-june-1990/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250815) I can sit down and watch... although, of course because someone has been kind enough to digitise the whole thing and [pop it onto YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aULilR7TS6c) - it's easier to do that.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/shimmy-disc-video-compilation-vol-1-vhs.jpg" "The Shimmy Disc Compilation Volume 1 (VHS)" %}

The compilation is packed with the usual Shimmy Disc faces, and compiled with the expected Shimmy Disc idiosyncracies. Each track is introduced with 1980s wedding video style text intros.

Galaxie 500's contribution is Sergio Huidor's video for {% ahfowtrack "Tugboat" %}.

There were two more Shimmy Disc video comps - Volume 2, which I don't have (but am on the lookout for), had the video for {% ahfowtrack "When Will You Come Home" %}, and Volume 3 had no contribution from Galaxie 500 at all. 

I bought this on eBay in 2014 although not sure for how much.

## This week in history

On the 11th August 1987 Galaxie 500 entered 6/8 Studios in New York to make their first recordings. Two sessions produced seven songs, three of which appeared on the bands first demo tape. Some copies of the tape also included the four other tracks.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-extended-demo-tape.jpg" "Galaxie 500 (demo tape)" "https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/01/11/my-record-collection-100-galaxie-500-the-extended-demo-tape/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250815" %}

The four extra tracks have never been officially released but you can hear them here:

## This week's discoveries and rediscoveries

 - Dean's newletter highlighted all the [Galaxie 500 and Dean Wareham vinyl currently available on the site](https://deanwareham.com/shop). He also listed all the upcoming solo and Luna shows - you can [see them all listed, with ticket links, on AHFoW](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/shows/upcoming.xml?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250815).
 - Damon's next book [Why Sound Matters](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300272246/why-sound-matters/) is available to pre-order now (from wherever you pre-order your books) - publication date is 21st October (a couple of UK sites list it as being published in early January, so I guess this side of the pond will have to wait an extra couple of months).
