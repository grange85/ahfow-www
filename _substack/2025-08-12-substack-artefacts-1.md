A few years ago I posted a series looking at some of the memorabilia I had accumulated over the years... this is the first post where I'll rehash a few of those posts. Consider it a wander around the AHFoW museum!

## Letter from Naomi, July 1997

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/flickr-downloads/48140164382_c699fcf600_b.jpg" "Letter from Naomi Yang - July 1997" %}

Back in 1997, in the wake of [the heartbreaking Ptolemaic Terrascope interview](http://www.terrascope.co.uk/MyBackPages/Damon_and_Naomi.htm), I wrote a fan letter to Damon & Naomi. To be honest I can't remember if this was a real letter or an email. In my head it was a real letter with a stamp and everything. But that maybe the romantic in me trying to convince myself that I'd written a proper, old fashioned fan letter.

For the sake of argument let's assume that it was real.

This was, I'm fairly certain, the first fan letter I'd written to anyone. I had previously joined the Motorheadbangers fan club but don't remember ever sending Lemmy a gushing letter.

The response I got was this lovely, and very real, letter from Naomi where she touches on the PT interview, and the first Terrastock festival.

There's more beneath the envelope but... I need some secrets. 

The last line read:

> Congratulations on your new baby

That new baby graduated from university in 2019.

## Aftershow pass for Luna show in London 1999

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/flickr-downloads/48457628806_2434bd6e9b_c.jpg" "Luna aftershow pass - London 1999" %}

The first time I was added to the guest-list for a Luna show was at The Embassy Rooms in London in 1999. I couldn't find anyone to come along to the show with me so my plus-one went begging. The guy on the door called me "Billy no-mates".

Dean wrote about the show in his tour diary on fuzzywuzzy...

<blockquote>
In London I bought a new toiletry bag at Boots, along with some nail clippers, and woollen cap at Paul Smith’s in Covent Garden. But it wasn’t hat weather. It was stinking hot at the Embassy Rooms where we performed -- a sold out club and no air conditioning.

The show was sweltering and I was dripping with sweat by the end of it and not really in a fit state to hang out with the band! But I had a backstage pass and felt obliged to use it. I chatted with Dean, he showed me a pic of (very young) Jack, and gave me chocolates, and introduced me to Justin (the only time (so far) I've had a chance to speak to to him and it was nothing more than a polite "hello").

I made my excuses as soon as I felt it was polite, and left.

## Kitten Frenzy no.2"

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/kitten-frenzy-fanzine.jpg" "Kitten Frenzy no.2 cover" %}

The fantastic fanzine **Kitten Frenzy** was the work of fab Glasgow band Urusei Yatsura's Graham Kemp. Issue no. 2 was released in Winter 1993 and had a lovely _obituary_ of Galaxie 500 

<blockquote>
Farewell then old friend. Though you will be sorely missed, yet there is still time to place vinyl under the needle and drink a cup of Ovaltine to the comforting, comfortless sound of Galaxie 500. I love you.
</blockquote>

It also had a sweet Galaxie 500 painting by numbers where Damon's hair was the colour _mousy_ and Naomi's shorts were the colour _dinosaur_

I'm not sure how this came into my collection (I certainly didn't buy it at the time) so suspect some kind soul sent me this ~ if it was you thanks, and sorry for not remembering!

I took the opportunity of reprinting (with permission) these in the Everything's Swirling 'zine in 2017.
