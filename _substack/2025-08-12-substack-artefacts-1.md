A few years ago I posted a series looking at some of the memorabilia I had accumulated over the years... this is the first post where I'll rehash a few of those posts. Consider it a wander around the AHFoW museum!

## Damon & Naomi tenugui

These very limited Damon & Naomi tenugui were sold on their _Lost Gaijin tour_ of Japan at the tail of 2009 - I was lucky enough to have been sent one by Naomi that for a while looked like it had gone astray in the postal system. It arrived in February 2010 - I tried it out but I looked a bit <a href="https://flic.kr/p/7Ah21G">too much like a biker</a> for it to get regular use!

The tenugui did briefly get called into use as a face mask during COVID.

I'm rather puzzled how faded it has become since it has spent most of its life in its paper wrapper in a folder... I guess I must have left it out for a while?

## Aftershow pass for Luna show in London 1999

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/flickr-downloads/48457628806_2434bd6e9b_c.jpg" "Luna aftershow pass - London 1999" %}

The first time I was added to the guest-list for a Luna show was at The Embassy Rooms in London in 1999. I couldn't find anyone to come along to the show with me so my plus-one went begging. The guy on the door called me "Billy no-mates".

Dean wrote about the show in his tour diary on fuzzywuzzy...

<blockquote>
In London I bought a new toiletry bag at Boots, along with some nail clippers, and woollen cap at Paul Smith’s in Covent Garden. But it wasn’t hat weather. It was stinking hot at the Embassy Rooms where we performed -- a sold out club and no air conditioning.

The show was sweltering and I was dripping with sweat by the end of it and not really in a fit state to hang out with the band! But I had a backstage pass and felt obliged to use it. I chatted with Dean, he showed me a pic of (very young) Jack, and gave me chocolates, and introduced me to Justin (the only time (so far) I've had a chance to speak to to him and it was nothing more than a polite "hello").

I made my excuses as soon as I felt it was polite, and left.

## Kitten Frenzy no.2

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/kitten-frenzy-fanzine.jpg" "Kitten Frenzy no.2 cover" %}

The fantastic fanzine **Kitten Frenzy** was the work of fab Glasgow band Urusei Yatsura's Graham Kemp. Issue no. 2 was released in Winter 1993 and had a lovely _obituary_ of Galaxie 500 

<blockquote>
Farewell then old friend. Though you will be sorely missed, yet there is still time to place vinyl under the needle and drink a cup of Ovaltine to the comforting, comfortless sound of Galaxie 500. I love you.
</blockquote>

It also had a sweet Galaxie 500 painting by numbers where Damon's hair was the colour _mousy_ and Naomi's shorts were the colour _dinosaur_

I'm not sure how this came into my collection (I certainly didn't buy it at the time) so suspect some kind soul sent me this ~ if it was you thanks, and sorry for not remembering!

I took the opportunity of reprinting (with permission) these in the Everything's Swirling 'zine in 2017.
