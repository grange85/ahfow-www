I just found this half written article from July 2016, I think it may have been intended to be the third "podcast" but I decided after the second one that nobody really wanted to hear my idle ramblings so it got ditched half-finished.

Today... it seems that you're going to get the chance to at least _read_ my idle ramblings.

## Part 1: Being a social fan

There was a time in between Galaxie 500 splitting up (in 1991) and us getting the Internet (late 1993 or early 94 I’d guess) when I thought I was the only Galaxie 500 fan in the world. Occasionally a journalist (normally Everett True) might drop their name into an article but otherwise it was just me.

The friends I’d seen Galaxie 500 with didn’t seem all that bothered by the fact that they weren’t around any more. Of course there was Luna, but I never really knew any Luna fans either and was always surprised that there was anyone else at the Luna shows I went to.

So the Internet was a glorious revelation not only did the people on there know of Galaxie 500 but some of them loved them as much as I did.

I’m not a social person so when after six or so months of the website someone emailed me and suggested that a mailing list for fans would be good it seemed unlikely that it will come to much, Particularly as, until I started the website I was pretty much the only fan I knew so it seemed unlikely that there were that many out there.

Despite this in the summer of 1995 I launched the Galaxie 500 Mailing List with an email that began…
“OK, it’s just the four of us”

Over the coming weeks and months things started to kick off and by the end of 1995, when the first survey was held, there were 124 subscribers.

In December of 1995 Luna played a cracking show at the Garage in Highbury & Islington support was Mojave 3. At this show I met fans for the first time; 

Lauren, who was in a band called Dart who released a couple of fine singles and an album on Ché and tried to talk me into introducing myself to Dean - I decided not to.

Trenton was young and enthusiastic.

I lost touch with both over the years.

I think I also met Paul at this gig (although I found something I wrote recently that suggests I first met him a bit later at a Damon & Naomi show).

So it turns out that, despite my finest efforts to be the bedroom fan, a part of being a website and mailing list co-ordinator was that it came with unwritten social responsibilities.

Get-togethers were happening, not just in London but elsewhere in the world - organised on the mailing list! People were becoming friends, and in at least one case more than friends, because of my mailing list.

Tim emailed me one day and we ended up going to a gig … that had nothing to do with Galaxie 500 at all! This was weird for me, I’m not comfortable with people, but I seemed to be comfortable with *these* people.

All through this the website, and particularly the mailing list were the hub of this fandom - the mailing list had ups and downs, the membership hovered around three or four hundred with probably only thirty or forty regularly active members - busy days could see twenty or thirty posts a day.

As the web began to rise the mailing list started to struggle.

Back in twenty oh seven I wrote about the demise of the fan web site - this is what I had to say back then:

<blockquote>
<p>Being the loving parent of a fan site it saddens me to see the demise of this venerable Internet institution. The corporate/official/record company sites never really cared about the band – they mostly just cared about the latest release they had to promote. Damon and Naomi for a while had three such web sites on the go, one for each of their (then) three most recent albums (thankfully their latest web site has a little bit more of the “fan site” feel about it).</p>

<p>The fan site was the baby of the dedicated individual who lovingly hand-crafted huge lists of tour date archives and setlists, photos and audio, reviews and interviews painstakingly transcribed by hand from magazines and newspapers, and a discography that included the most obscure and pointless of releases just for the sake of being complete – only a real fan could possibly care that the album version of Superfreaky Memories was given away on a Mojo coverdisc…</p>

<p>I recently headed over to Chairkickers – the official Low site. The site had started as a fan site but the band made it the official site, that must have been such a buzz – to be recognised by the artists it so lovingly represents. For a while after the move from fan to official not a lot changed – it still had the feel of a site that was run by people who loved it and loved what it was about. Sadly that isn’t the case any more, Chairkickers today looks like a corporate site and like so many corporate sites with the change things went astray. The list of past shows, the setlists, the pictures, the band’s past, it’s history…just slipped away with it (the discography doesn’t even seem to have links for the band’s first three albums!).</p>

<p>Maybe it’s because the vile MySpace has become the home to the fan page (and, laughably, the corporate page as well) or maybe because Wikipedia is now host to all the facts and release information that anyone could want, or just maybe the potential fan site builders are too busy blogging. Whatever the reason it seems the days of the fan site is over and all that’s left are the few excellent sites run by the few dedicated individuals (saddoes??) that will remind the world what things were like in the days before MySpace and Wikipedia and blogs…or we can always go have a look on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine!</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="caption"><a href="">The end of the fan site? (Everything's Swirling - 9th May 2007)</a></p>

Obviously since then MySpace has become meaningless and Facebook has become the strange mix of fan and corporate presence, and as well as Wikipedia sites like setlists.fm and Discogs have eaten into the fan site's responsibilities,

Meanwhile...

On the mailing list things would go quiet, sometimes for days. When bands were touring things perked up - and around Christmas things would get festive and fun. But clearly things were changing. Community, and socialising was happening elsewhere - and “single subject” mailing lists seemed to struggle.

Not just the Galaxie 500 Mailing List - but many lists I belonged to started to get quiet.

Online discussion forums and bulletin boards seemed to be working better now that people were spending more time in their browser than in their email programs (and then their email programs were in their browsers), but then they too began to struggle..

Only the bulletin boards with a borader remit like [I Love Music](https://www.ilxor.com/ILX/NewAnswersControllerServlet?boardid=41) survived.

I tried to hook into this - setting up online forums, and “social networks” but it was difficult to get the buy in, and all such efforts almost inevitably failed - not helped by the constant vigilance to deal with the spam that was less easy to control in these mediums.

I think to make these things succeed you needed a lively and social leader, and that was never going to be me!

As the web went social I tried to establish a foothold in this new world, setting up groups in Flickr and LastFM but again these never really took.

Eventually it became clear that Twitter and particularly Facebook were where fans were interacting. I set up a Facebook page that thrived - it soon had more than double the number of followers than the mailing list ever had, but it was mostly one way traffic - it wasn’t a community - it was a marketing channel.

Fans weren’t chatting.

That said, Facebook became a catalyst for the in real life community - when Dean Wareham toured the UK in 2013 a Facebook organised event before the London show was well attended and fun.

But still the online interaction of the height of the Mailing List was missing.

## Part 2: On the fan/band relationship

So, creating A Head Full of Wishes had brought with it unexpected - and what I thought were frankly unwanted social responsibilities. Somehow the web site and mailing list became the hub of a community that extended beyond the Internet.

The other side of that was that at some point the site became noticed by the band.

Dean mentioned in an interview in the mailing lists early days about having signed up to the list but being troubled by the factual errors that he didn’t feel able to correct.

So what I was doing was on the band’s radar - but what I was doing was never *for* the band - it was always for the fans, and the reverse of Dean’s issues were that once the band were aware of the fans did that change how the fans communicate amongst themselves?

Shortly after joining the band in 2000 Britta signed up to the mailing list and became a moderately active member of the list - giving us insights and insider knowledge. She often also felt a bit like a fan - she was sort of one of us.

But as a member of one of the bands we discussed did that change the dynamic? Did we tone down for fear of offence? Did we hold back.

When Lee joined the band in 1997 there was a bit of negativity - based, in retrospect, not because of any deficiency on Lee’s part, but purely because he wasn’t Stan. But some fans vented. But as fans, that’s what the community was for - would it have happened if a band member had been on the list (or I guess rather, if we KNEW that a band member was on the list?)

I remember - and am slightly embarrassed at this - taking a particularly hard-line in a discussion not because I believed what I was saying but because I didn’t like the idea that these things shouldn’t be said for fear of offending the band. In my head I offended the band - in reality I imagine no one noticed. I still wince at the thought.

By the time Luna split in 2005, Britta’s place on the mailing list was accepted - the list dynamic may have changed, but it had settled into what it was - it had become a prototype of fan-artist relationship in the age of social media.

With the advent of Twitter and Facebook, and with bands now required to engage with their fans I think it helped, as LUNA fans, feeling that Britta was someone who did this not through any obligation, or for marketing or PR reasons, but because she clearly seemed to be enjoying it.

Of course it has marketing and PR benefits - I have no idea, and no way of measuring, if A Head Full of Wishes has benefitted the bands that it champions but I think it might be hard to put a value on that - maybe it has helped sell a record or two, or a few tickets - but remember, as I said, that’s not what it was ever for.

A while back I got into a discussion with Justin Harwood (LUNA’s first bassist) about how the industry has changed and he said that what has changed is that music became easy to get - that in the past fans had to “pan for gold” and the artist could see and appreciate the effort that a fan makes:

<blockquote>
<p>In “the old days” intrinsic value was added to music because it was like panning for gold. You would stay up and listen to Peel, or you would go to the store every tuesday morning and read what Everett True thought was worthy of his ears, or you had to wait until your brother was out to play his vinyl. Or you would go to Other Music, or Reckless Records with $50 in your pocket and have to make a decision.</p>

<p>That effort, that decision, that ownership, made the music a valuable commodity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Justin Harwood (200?)</p>
My response was that fans still did that, in different ways, and that the “gold” might be different - but fans are still there and still making the effort.

I'm not smart enough to go into any great detailed analysis of the fan/artist relationship but fortunately that has been well done by Nancy Baym in here book [Playing to The Crowd](https://nyupress.org/9781479821587/playing-to-the-crowd/) although the book is very much discussing the artists perspective on that relationship (which of course is something I have no insight into).

Across the course of two chapters of the book Nancy discusses the _participatory_ and _relational_ boundaries and how artist can choose to manage those boundaries, certainly the section that most closely matches the experience of AHFoW is subtitled _Accept Autonomy_

<blockquote>
The controlling strategies of territorializing and invoking intellectual property rights seek to manage where audiences practice their fandom and which practices they are allowed to do there. When artists accept audience autonomy, they leave fans to their own devices to do their own things, either providing a home for, ignoring, or explicitly supporting them as they do. 
</blockquote>

When AHFoW launched there was no _official_ resource on the web for Galaxie 500 or for Luna or Damon & Naomi so for a while it became the _only_ resource to find this information so it made sense that once I was on their radar that Dean, Damon, and Naomi would make use of it. Damon acknowledged this when I (email-)interviewed him for [Terrascopaedia](https://www.ptolemaic.org/) in 2019:

<blockquote>
<p>Here’s where the web – and specifically your site – enters the story. Cause Jeff Rougvie got Don Rose interested, and we managed to get everyone on our end together, and we made a contract. And then nothing happened. Cause here’s another problem with having a defunct band: there’s no urgency. No upcoming tour or recording or promo opportunity to pin it to. It’s just a project in a folder in a pile on a desk – it could happen anytime. Or never.</p>
<p>But then Jeff hired a young assistant – maybe she was even an intern at first? – named Andrea Troolin, and Andrea found the project in that pile and made it hers. How to rally the company behind finally doing something with it, however? Your web site! Andrea pointed to the Galaxie 500 mailing list, and the activity on it, as evidence that there was interest out there in the band and its out-of-print catalogue. Next thing you know… box set! </p>
</blockquote>

Obviously once the artists started having _official_ websites the relationship changed, but barely.

**Galaxie 500**'s first _official_ website was the [one created by Jen Matson for the Box Set release in 1996](https://static.fullofwishes.co.uk/galaxie500box/).

**Luna** first launched an _official_ website in February 1997 although it never really got going - the web developers literally lifted the code from my site and plopped it into theirs, without asking and without any credit. When I pointed this out to them I was assured that they "intend to give you full credit when the site is officially launched and no longer under construction" - the site never got beyond "under construction" and quietly disappeared. To be replaced by the wonderful, and much missed FuzzyWuzzy which launched in 1998.

FuzzyWuzzy was Justin Harwood's baby and was gloriously irreverant, and beautifully amateurish. 

For the first time the band was using the web to try and build a relationship with the fans - they invited fans to engage with them ("ask Lee, he knows") and kept the fans up-to-date with tour dates and release news. More crucially though this was the band doing it so it felt more like a genuine attempt at engagement with the fans as people rather than as a revenue stream.

They also provided a link from their site to mine!

**Damon & Naomi**'s first web sites were launched, via SubPop, to promote releases - a new one for each release starting with _Wondrous World..._ in 1997.

Of course this was an overlap with what I was doing, although my remit was wider. In his book [Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll](https://www.netblogsrocknroll.com/about.html) David Jennings touched on this:

<blockquote>
In future, if they’re not already, fan communities will quickly become the most authoritative archivists for the artists they follow. They collect memorabilia and ephemera — from ticket stubs to magazine interviews and amateur bootleg recordings — that most people would dismiss as tat… As well as memorabilia, these items will include what are currently rare and hard-to-find audio and video recordings, which will be collected by both human foraging and automated 'sweeping' of the Net. Expert fans will catalogue them and record their digital fingerprints, to help identify whether further discoveries are duplicates or new additions to the archive.
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">David Jennings - Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll (2007)</p>

The artist/fan relationship changed once again with the rise of social media. Suddenly it was practically _expected_ that an artist would be on these platforms and engaging with their fans, some found this easier than others. This did however add another "job" to an artist's already busy schedule and one that was probably quite difficult to measure the value of.
