Luna over the years have curated quite an art gallery on the sleeves of their LPs in this post I'll do a little run through. I don't really know a great deal about the artists, or how or why any particular art or artist was chosen so this is mostly what I think I know, and what the Internet thinks it knows.

### Lunapark (1992)

The sleeve of Lunapark has a picture of a pencil sharpener, I know that now, and it doesn’t look like anything else… *now*. A space age pencil sharpener for sure, but so obviously a pencil sharpener, and so obviously with a pencil sticking out of it. When I discovered what it was I felt a bit stupid for all the years it had been a spaceship or a ray gun. I posted it on Facebook a couple of years ago and it was quite a relief that a good few comments revealed that I wasn’t alone in my stupidity...

 - "All these years I thought it was a toy ray gun"
 - "I always thought it was a spaceship. Lol."
 - "SON OF A BITCH. It all makes sense now."
 - "Enlightened"

The pencil sharpener was designed by reknowned industrial designer Raymond Loewy who's designs ranged from a pencil sharpener to ["the largest passenger locomotive ever constructed"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad_class_S1).

Also to be found on the Lunapark sleeves are little bits of Kim Novak's face who can be seen in full on the cover of the Smile EP.

The album credits [Laurie Henzel](https://www.lauriehenzel.com/about) with the art direction.

### Bewitched (1994)

Bewitched actually has two quite distinct sleeves. The original that appeared on the CD and cassette releases in 1994 and then a radicaly different sleeve when the album was released on vinyl for the first time in 2012. The version released in 2012 was actually intended for the original release but was replaced at the last minute for the more abstract version. The back of the CD sleeve, and the booklet, included photos from the same session as the photo that finally arrived on the front of the LP versions.

To be honest I could never quite figure out exactly what was on the front of my CD.

The picture of the young woman sitting in a chair is a bit clearer to ID. The young woman is actress [Chloë Sevigny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlo%C3%AB_Sevigny) and she's sitting in a [Ball Chair designed by Finnish designer Eero Aarnio in 1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Chair) and watching (I think) a [JVC videosphere telly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videosphere).

Dean turned up in a Ball Chair in the video for his cover of Scott Walker's Duchess (obviously this wasn't a coincidence!).

The photography was by [Michael Levine](https://michaellavine.com/LINKS/CONTACT/1) and once again the art direction was by [Laurie Henzel](https://www.lauriehenzel.com/about).

### Penthouse (1995)

For Penthouse the band moved away from industrial design and the front cover of Penthouse is a beautiful photo taken from a series by photographer Ted Croner in 1947/8.

Dean Wareham explained how he came across the photos for the sleeve in an interview in Salon in 2016:

<blockquote>
Frank Olinsky and I went to see a show of photographs by Ted Croner, who was part of the New York School of photographers from the 50s. He had taken some beautiful photographs of New York City buildings […] and we picked out these great photos of New York buildings at night—shimmering photos—the light seemed to pour out of them. I met Croner, and he explained that these signature shots of his were partially caused by the cold weather; that as he stood in Central Park taking those photos, it was so cold that his hands were shaking, which caused these blurred streaks of light.

Frank Olinsky also discussed the design of Penthouse in Rock That Font in 2011:

<blockquote>
Dean had discovered Ted Croner’s magical photos of New York City and knew they were just right for the package. Three pictures were used: the cover photo of the lit-up skyscraper, a group of light-streaked high-rise buildings, and a blurry speeding taxi [...] Everything came together just right. That was the first time I used Interstate, but certainly not the last time I used this font!

The photo of the blurry speeding taxi that was used in the inside of the sleeve (and on the cover of the Hedgehog / 23 Minutes in Brussels single) was later used by Bob Dylan for the front of his 2006 LP [Modern Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Times_(Bob_Dylan_album)). This [post on PopSpots](https://popspotsnyc.com/modern_times/) does some fine research tracking down the locations of the photos.

In a post on Entertainment Weekly in 2006 the similarity was discussed:

<blockquote>
Dylan declined to comment, but his album’s designer, Geoff Gans, told EW in an e-mail: ”I’m really surprised! I really liked Luna…but never saw that release. I’m fairly sure Bob never saw that release either…. Strange things happen every day.” Luna’s Dean Wareham, meanwhile, isn’t upset. ”I’d like to think that Dylan saw [our EP]. It would be flattering,” he says. ”But I doubt it.”
