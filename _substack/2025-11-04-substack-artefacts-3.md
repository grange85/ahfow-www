Another dip into my collection of _things that aren't records or CDs_ and this time I thought I'd pull a few things from the bookshelf:

### Angry Women in Rock Volume One with Naomi Yang"

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/flickr-downloads/48506259441_d6148dfd71_c.jpg" "Naomi Yang in Angry Women in Rock Volume 1" %}

In 1996 Naomi was interviewed by Andrea Juno for this book Angry Women in Rock Volume One. The book was published in New York and I never managed to track down a copy and admit that I stopped looking when another fan sent me a photocopy of Naomi's interview.

I struggled to come to terms with the idea that Naomi was an _Angry Woman_ of rock - I think she did too

> Do I have anything to say? Is this even an issue for me?

But, re-reading the interview she manages to be angry about...

- Music stores:

> The sales help tend to treat you like a jerk unless they recognize you from your Grammy award ceremony.

- Her music teacher

> He was making fun of simplicty.

- Madonna

> I think it's all self-promotion. That's pop culture and I feel very alienated from that.

- Major record labels

> Dens of evil. They're about mediocrity not music

- The industry of music

> So much that is venerated is really bad. It makes me distrust popularity.

The interview concludes with Naomi's _equipment list_ becuase...

> it always seemed to me that the equipment list was the best thing about \[_Guitar Player_\]

so...

Naomi's equipment list (1996)

> Cherry red 1968 Gibson EB-2DC bass (semi-hollow-bodied bass, shaped like a 335 Gibson guitar), Trace Eliot AH200 amp head and a single 15" EV speaker for playing live, old Ampeg B-18 Portaflex amp for recording, Boss Super Overdrive pedal (used rarely)

I finally saw a copy for real when a pal brought a copy over for me to look at, and I realised that I really ought to own a copy - and eBay made that easy. So now I have this gorgeous picture of Naomi with her dad's Rolleiflex TLR which in my photocopy was just a black mess!

The book has interviews with other musicians, possibly more angry than Naomi, such as Joan Jett, Chrissie Hynde, and Kathleen Hanna. I'm not sure if there ever was a _Volume 2_.

### Dean Wareham - Postales Negras / Damon Krukowski - The New Analog

A few months ago I posted about the copy of Black Postcards that Dean sent to me on publication, and the sorry state it was in:

https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/my-copy-of-dean-warehams-black-postcards

But I do have a copy that is in absolutely mint condition, it even still has a little promo belt around the cover. It looks like it's barely been touched and the reason for that is that it's barely been touched! I don't speak, or read, Spanish so it would be fairly pointless for me to open it, I just loved the idea of having Dean's book in another language. When it arrived I checked two things:

 1. That I still got a name check in the back (I know, how vain is that)... and I do _"Gracias a: Andy Aldridge,..."_.
 2. And, with the help of Google Translate, that it had the updated last chapter with Indian Summer and 23 Minutes... played in the right order at Luna's last show... it does.

I didn't notice when I checked those things that this edition also has an epilogue written in 2012 that isn't in my English paperback edition - I wonder if there was an English edition with the epilogue? It also has a prologue written by Spanish journalist, and friend of the band Ignacio Juliá. I'm going to get Google Translate to work on those bits!

I bought this from Amazon in Spain and at the same time, bought the Spanish edition of Damon's _The New Analog_ which, slightly disappointingly is called "The New Analog" in Spanish - although the subtitle is translated "CÓMO ESCUCHAR Y RECONECTARNOS EN EL MUNDO DIGITAL".

### I Hope This Finds You Well - edited by Dan Stafford

Way back in 2007 Dan, a friend of AHFoW and long-standing Galaxie 500 Mailing List member, carried out a series of interviews with various artists using the old fashioned method of writing on bits of paper and posting them off, and getting the replies, on bits of paper, posted back to him. He interviewed Dean and Britta in this way and published it on his web site, along with a lot more interviews.

It is a fantastic book because it was such a good idea, you can glean so much about people not just from what they write, but the way they write it, and so makes a fascinating and insightful read... and, since Dan's in the business of comics, it's also often more than just words!



In 2014 these interviews were compiled into a lovely little book that Dean sent me a copy of.
