Tugboat was Galaxie 500's first single, recorded in February 1988 at Noise New York by Kramer and released as a 7” single on Aurora Records. 

A good few years ago I started noticing that if some other band or artist decided to cover a Galaxie 500 song Tugboat is the one they would invariably reach for. More recently Stange is getting its fair share of covers, but still Tugboat covers regularly turn up.

For a while I kept [a post collecting these covers](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/articles/a-fleet-of-tugboats/) up to date but it's been neglected for a few years, but there are still lots of gems to be found there. 

Now, I love _all Galaxie 500 covers_! Mostly because just the simple fact of choosing to cover Galaxie 500 is likely to endear me to you as an artist... but obviously I have favourites, and this post will collect some of those together... but, before that, I guess we should start with the original... and best!

Tugboat was recorded at Kramer's Noise New York studio at the band's first session.

<blockquote>
<p>I don't think our first "session" was more than a few hours. [Kramer] barely said a word but put a remarkable amount of reverb on the vocals to Tugboat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Damon Krukowski - essay in the box set booklet (1996)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We didn't have the foggiest idea how to record a song.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>"Tugboat" was comprised of a single repeating chord change (one that Damon came up with) to which I added a very simple guitar line. Kramer drenched my voice in reverb and echo, and sent me out to play some kind of guitar solo. I was given one take. The song explodes in ecstasy a little over halfway through, riding out with cymbal splashes and a guitar phrase that repeats over and over before the song breaks down and it feels like the clouds have lifted.</p>

The rest are in no particular order - or at least in an order that is in constant flux!

### Sea Power

Sea Power's cover of Galaxie 500's Tugboat (back when they were British Sea Power) was first released on the Rough Trade compilation LP [Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Me_If_You_Think_You%27ve_Heard_This_One_Before...) released in 2003 to celebrate the label's 25th birthday. The song then put in fairly regular appearances at their live shows.

Earlier this year Dean Wareham performed two Galaxie 500 sets with Sea Power and both finished with an absolutely storming version of Tugboat, with Dean sharing vocals with Hamilton from the band. This is them playing it at Hebden Bridge:

Now, I know that I do keep going on about that week back in August but... wouldn't you? If you need to know why I guess you should read my earlier post on that week.

### BMX Bandits featuring Angel Corpus Christi

BMX Bandits lovely cover was released on the fantastic [Elefant Records comp Snowstorm](https://elefantrecords.bandcamp.com/album/snowstorm-a-tribute-to-galaxie-500) back in 2001 and features some lovely phoned-in(?) vocal augmentations from Angel Corpus Christi. It's an album loaded with lovely Galaxie 500 covers (it also had another Tugboat cover by Portastatic). Tugboat was later also released on a [BMX Bandits retrospective](https://bmxbanditsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/the-rise-fall-of-bmx-bandits).

### Joanna Gruesome

Joanna Gruesome's cover is so gloriously punchy. It was released on a single by Fortuna Pop! in 2013. Damon commented on Twitter when it was posted by Pitchfork:

<blockquote>
I think they got our primitivism - thank you @JOANNAGRUESOME
</blockquote>
<p class="caption"><a href="https://x.com/dada_drummer/status/400720336989483008">@dada_drummer on Twitter</a> (13th November 2013)</p>

https://indietracks.bandcamp.com/track/tugboat

It became a regular, and invariably awesome part of their live set. There are [plenty of clips on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=joanna+gruesome+tugboat+live) and all a pretty breathtaking... here's one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvQG_gmbGAA

The summer after it was released Joanna Gruesome and Dean Wareham were both scehduled on the same day at Indietracks and Dean joined them on-stage to perform it. It's perhaps not as breathtaking as the performances above partly, I think, because Joanna Gruesome's set up until this point had been plagued by sound problems and they had perhaps lost some of the Indietracks spirit. Add to the unrehearsed appearance of Dean was perhaps a little... distracting. Still... pretty special anyway.

### Submarine

I don't really know a great deal about Submarine, although I have vague memories of seeing them in the early 90s... maybe supporting someone... and maybe in Brighton? Although that being 30+ years ago there's a fair chance that I'm thinking of someone else! 

They released their cover of Tugboat on the b-side of a mail-order only singles club release. They also recorded it for a Peel Session on 23rd March 1993 which was broadcast a month later. Both the single version, and the Peel Session featured contribution from Claire Lemmon of Sidi Bou Said whos album from around that time, [Brooch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a25wBVpytBI) is worth spending some time with.

Here's the single version of Tugboat:

And here's the Peel Session complete with John's intro and outro:

### "Mittenfingers" and "Jecks"

Know nothing about this but... look these sweet young (so young!) kids sitting on their couch doing a lovely Tugboat cover

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8hJboQCEaY

... it's from eight years ago so they'll be grown ups now. There's more, and more recent. music on [the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mittenfingers3321).

### The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy

This was one of the earliest Galaxie 500 covers, I was sent this on a cassette back in the early 90s. According to the very excellent [Jazz Butcher website](https://v1.jazzbutcher.com/) the band played Tugboat live a few times during 1992 and this version was released on a live album, as "Tugboat Captain", in 1992. I think I mostly love this because Jazz Buthcer were covering this so soon after Galaxie 500's break-up. While researching this I came across this [Western Family DAT pre-master](https://jazzbutcher.com/western_dat)...

<blockquote>
<p>This release was made entirely from live to-DAT recordings I made as I followed the merry Conspiracy through the USA and Canada. During the tour, it had not yet been decided ifa live recording was actually being made - I was simply doing what I love to do; preserving the moment for my own amusement.</p>

<p>As it happened, Pat decided to go ahead and construct a live release from my master tapes. After the tour, Pat and Martin Stebbing (Rev. Botus Whiteblood Fleming) went into Battery Studio in Chicago and worked my tapes over.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the process, my master tapes were lost and what was sent to Creation Records for the pressing was worked over further by minions unknown, and the final release sounds, basically, rather poor.</p>

<p>I had resigned myself to this let-down until a sort-of miracle occurred:a pre-master for Western Family has surfaced - tunes from beyond the grave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption"><a href="https://jazzbutcher.com/western_dat">David Whittemore - jazzbutcher.com</a></p>

... so I guess you should go listen to it there.

Pat Fish (who was The Jazz Butcher) revisited Tugboat at [this live show in 2006](https://v1.jazzbutcher.com/gigs/2006/Oct1.html).

He also covered Dean & Britta's The Sun is Still Sunny for a Covid-era live stream. [Go to Fishy Mansions #8](https://jazzbutcher.com/fishy_mansions) and skip to 1:07:55 to hear this lovely version.

Sadly Pat passed away a couple of years ago, he was such a legend and is still much missed.
