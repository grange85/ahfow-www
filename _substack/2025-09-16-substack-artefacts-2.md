This is the second post where I revisit some of the memorabilia I've accumulated over the 35 years of fandom.

### Luna - Lunafied (CDR)

This is a CDR of Lunafied that Dean sent me back in 2006 after some rather unsubtle scrounging on my part!

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/luna-lunafied-cdr.jpg" "Lunafied CDR and postcard" %}

Lunafied was originally released as a digital only release by Rhino and wasn't available outside of the US and despite the fact that I already had all the songs on it in some form I wanted a copy so... I wrote to Dean. I hope he doesn't mind me publishing the email exchange that led me to having this CDR:

Hi Dean,  

I love the "sleeve" of the Lunafied album - particularly as I've been sucked into the pinhole-camera thing of late* so camera-obscura's are very exciting - I keep wanting to turn our bedroom into a camera obscura but Hazel rightly points out that the row of Victorian terraced houses on the opposite side of the road isn't quite the Empire State Building!

Does Lunafied exist as a "real" CD (maybe as a promo???) I'd love to own a proper CD with that sleeve! (sorry for the unsubtle attempted scrounge there!).

Any news on the Beggars covers album?

Have a nice summer,

Hi Andy,

the lunafied image is by Abelardo Morell, but perhaps you knew that already. His photos are great.

http://www.abelardomorell.net/

But there is no CD with that image, not even a promo. Rhino wanted it to be exclusive to the iTunes store. They have said that they might get around to releasing it on CD one day, but frankly I don't think it's going to happen. I can burn you a disc of Lunafied (from the master that was prepared).

Beggar's still haven't given me a date, though they suggested it would be September.

Did you get a copy of the Best Of? I can send you one of those too. No new songs, but the package is nice.

happy 4th of July!

Dean

I was looking at his other photos on his web site yesterday - they are great

I would love that if it's not too much bother.

I'm looking forward to that - it's all the more frustrating because Europeans can't buy from the US iTunes (or from the Rhino site) I've had half a dozen email from folk trying to get hold of it...

Thanks but I've ordered a copy (although it hasn't arrived yet).

Thanks a lot - enjoy the fireworks!

You tell them that good things come to those who wait... the Beggar's version will have 17 covers (including "Sweet Child O' Mine" and  "Only Women Bleed" and "Jealous Guy", which are not on the iTunes album).
I'll put it in the mail asap.

The CDR arrived a week or so later - with a postcard dated 4th of July - so... all in one day. It contained the 17 track Beggars Banquet version of Lunafied so the extra tracks Dean mentions, plus Neon Lights, but is missing Fly Into The Mystery and Happy New Year from the Rhino/iTunes version.

Lunafied eventually got a proper, physical release on vinyl so that beautiful [Abelardo Morell camera obscura](https://www.abelardomorell.net/selectedworks/camera-obscura) photo got put on the front of a lovely 12” package (and more on the back and inside the gatefold) and pretty much all of Luna’s Lunafied covers are on there!

_You can see a load of [my pinhole camera photographs on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/albums/260543) - including quite a few of the Victorian terrace I mentioned (and far too many unflattering self-portraits)._

### Galaxie 500 T-shirts

#### Original T-shirt bought at a gig in 1990

Before I write this up, a message to the chap who always asks to buy any T-shirts whenever I post about them - No! They're not for sale and won't be in my lifetime.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/galaxie-500-t-shirt-worn.jpg" "Galaxie 500 - T shirt (1990)" %}

My mum laundered hard. Washing Machine was one of the gods she worshipped, it had its shrine in the cupboard under the stairs and she fed it on a diet of powerful detergents and insanely hot water, and regularly made sacrificial offerings of our clothes. Washing Machine took these offerings and returned them shrunken and misshapen.

Our school rugby kit was gold with a blue trim and from my second match I played in a murky greeny-yellow coloured kit. I had grey-pink shirts that should have been white and grey-pink towels that once were red.

Back in the day I just went to gigs. No camera, no tape recorder, no phone (because I didn’t live in the future). Just me, a couple of mates and enough cash to buy a beer or two. Mostly the memorabilia from these shows is in my head, and old-age and the aforementioned “beer or two” mean that my head isn’t always a reliable store for memorabilia.

Sadly I allowed my mum to wash hard my first and last Galaxie 500 T-shirt, bought at the show at the Subterania that still tops my best show of all time list. I’m pretty sure the print on the front lasted no more than one or two washes but it’s my only bit of authentic physical memorabilia from a Galaxie 500 show so, of course, I have kept and loved it.

#### Original T-shirt sent to me by Naomi

Back in April 2018 some new Galaxie 500 T-shirts were produced in multiple colours and I mentioned to Naomi that Hazel had commented on there being five different coloured T-shirts on the washing line at once. Naomi replied apologising to Hazel and mentioned that she'd put "something extra" in a package for me.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/galaxie-500-t-shirt-new.jpg" "Galaxie 500 - T-shirt (1989/90)" %}

That something extra was this! Accompanied by a note 'Spring Cleaning means you ask "why am I keeping 28-year-old t-shirts?"'

An original 1989/1990 shirt, designed by Tess Kramer with a photo by Macioce on the front. I put it on once, and took a photo and then packed it carefully away. Naomi said that I should wear it "even if it self-destructs" but I'm saving it for a special occasion! Heaven knows when or what that will be.

### Damon & Naomi posters

A snap of the Damon & Naomi wall in the museum (or my bedroom), containing five beautiful posters - two signed, but only one for a show I was actually at.
