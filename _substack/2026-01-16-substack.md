### My record collection [317] The Portable Galaxie 500

Oddly there are two CDs that I swear I had in my collection but can't actually find one was the original Uncollected released by Ryko from 2004, and the other was the CD compilation The Portable Galaxie 500 released by Ryko in 1998. When I realised this, I bought myself a copy of _The Portable..._ in 2024 from Damon & Naomi along with some other stuff. I still don't have a copy of Uncollected but hope to have one before this series ends!

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-portable-cd.jpg" "The Portable Galaxie 500" %}

If someone asked me to pick twelve Galaxie 500 tracks for a comp it could easily have been the twelve on this one. Actually [someone did ask me once to pick ten](https://poeticjusticemagazine.com/2022/10/04/a-head-full-of-wishes-top-10-galaxie-500-songs/) and six tracks from The Portable were in my list - plus the studio version of Summertime ... so pretty much 7/10 which means I was fairly close to this. Although I was asked to pick my "Top 10" which is very different from picking for a compilation.

One of the tracks that I didn't pick for my list that did make it onto this comp was Strange which seems to have overtaken {% ahfowtrack "Tugboat" %} as the Galaxie 500 song of choice - Damon collened on this in a post:

<blockquote>
<p>“Strange,” a track off our album On Fire, is streaming far more than any of our other songs - roughly ten times as often as the songs that surround it in its original sequence on the album (”Snowstorm” and “When Will You Come Home”).</p> 

<p>What’s especially surprising about this is that “Strange” was not a single for Galaxie 500, and hasn’t historically been among our most popular tracks.
</p></blockquote>

Dean disagrees...

<blockquote>
I mention that the most popular Galaxie 500 song on Spotify is “Strange” and there has been some speculation from my former bandmate Damon that this success was driven by the Spotify algorithm: “Strange” was not a single back in the day and no video was made, so why would it get to the top of the our chart now?  I would counter that it should have been a single, and its popularity today is the proof. The song found its audience.

I'm inclined to agree with Damon however, possibly because Strange isn't one of my favourite Galaxie 500 tracks and it doesn't make a jot of sense to me that it would get streamed "roughly ten times as often" as {% ahfowtrack "Snowstorm" %} or {% ahfowtrack "When Will You Come Home" %} which are to my mind the most _Galaxie 500_ of all songs! Taking the accumulated votes of the last five years of the [Galaxie 500 Mailing list survey](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/a-history-of-the-annual-ahfow-survey) (from 2016 to 2020) Strange came in only fifth and actually had tailed off a bit in the last couple of years.

I'm inclined to think that Spotify _listeners_ listen to only Strange but _Galaxie 500 fans_ are just as likely to listen to something else!

The photo on the front of the album is of the weather vane on the top of the restaurant on Brighton's Palace Pier taken by Naomi in 1989. I took a the same photo a few years ago but sadly haven't managed to track it down!

### My record collection [318] Dean Wareham - Love is Colder Than Death (promo CD)

A couple of years ago I picked this promo CD of Dean's 2013 single along with some other stuff from a seller on eBay - given that I already had three vinyl copies of the single it might seem like an unnecessary addition to the collection.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/dean-wareham-love-is-colder-promo-cd.jpg" "Dean Wareham - Love is Colder... (promo CD)" %}

Of course nothing is really unnecessary in my eyes and my justification is that I now have Dean's cover of Cheval Sombre's She Went Walking in The Rain on CD and this is possibly the only place I could have got that.

The promo was released by Sonic Cathedral I assume to try and get some radio play - according to last.fm, BBC 6Music (the UK's most likely station) played the a-side [at least five times](https://www.last.fm/user/bbc6music/library/music/Dean+Wareham) and the b-side at least once.

The CD came in a PVC envelope with a white insert and a sticker on the front with information and credits and the news that Dean will have some "UK live shows in December 2013". The disc has the traditional warning that it is "for promotional use only, not for sale" which is of course a warning that has long and often been ignored by the recipients of promo releases!
