Many years ago when I put together [an FAQ](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2019/08/23/artefacts-014-the-galaxie-500-mailing-list-minifaq-1996/) for A Head Full of Wishes and in it I included the question "What is a Galaxie 500?" 

 - I remember Hazel being disappointed that 'Galaxie 500' were named after something so worldly as a car, rather than something other-worldly.
 - I had a work colleague who was the only person I'd ever met who had heard of the car but not the band.

For a while I actually had trouble finding a picture of the car to include as evidence of where the band pinched their name. Eventually someone sent me a picture which lived as an answer to that question. I didn't ever feel the need to go into any more detail than _it's a car_. Later I started linking to the Yahoo! category (remember, from the days when Yahoo! was a directory) I never, knowingly, saw one in real life until I went to the Goodwood Revival in 2002. The revival is a vintage car rally held at the Goodwood motor-racing circuit which was not far from where my dad lives.

Nowadays the car is better represented on the web than the band - most (new) "Galaxie 500" pictures on Flickr or Instagram, and videos on YouTube are of the car. 

It doesn't bother me, maybe because, despite not being the sort of person who cares about cars (don&#39;t own one, don&#39;t want to) I quite like looking at these gas-guzzling monstrosities from an era when a car could look individual and no one cared what damage it might do to the environment.
<p /> Anyway I do like looking and I mostly like looking at the logos - so i put together a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/galleries/72157623767017895/">gallery on flickr of some of my favourite pictures of the varied Galaxie 500 logos</a>...
<p /> Here&#39;s a picture of my son Adam patiently appeasing his boring old man by posing next to a Galaxie 500 in 2003...<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/4535593823/"><img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2804/4535593823_2e6c35e8da.jpg" border="0" /></a>
