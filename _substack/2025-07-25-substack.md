## Damon & Naomi - The Earth is Blue (LP)

This is the LP of The Earth is Blue that [last time out](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/05/15/my-record-collection-damon-naomi-the-earth-is-blue-promo-cd/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250725) I declared it as "certainly their most beautiful album" and nothing in the two months since that post has changed my mind!

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/damon-and-naomi-the-earth-is-blue-lp.jpg" "Damon & Naomi - The Earth is Blue (LP)" %}

Of course, it is even more beautiful on LP, not because of any of that nonsense about "analog warmth" or "dynamic range" - no, it's more beautiful on LP because it comes in a 12" square package and therefore has a lovely big version of Naomi's lovely picture on the front... although I do have to say that this meant I noticed two things I hadn't really noticed before:

1. The picture is horizontally flipped and repeated across its two sides... this was the same as on the CD but I never really clicked that this wasn't a lovely wide panorama - nope it's the same picture twice (on the digipack CD it's the same picture two and a bit times).
2. The picture suffered somewhat being blown up to 12" square (twice) and is a little less sharp becuase of that - I guess because it maybe wasn't shot in high enough resolution in the first place? Or maybe the printing let it down slightly.

That said, it's _still_ more beautiful than the CD. The record is in a printed inner sleeve, that is blue monotone but has a selection of photos that were in colour in the CD booklet, but... bigger and differently cropped and the blue tone suits them perfectly - so, despite there being fewer pictures and them having less colour, they are so much better on the LP... look at this lovely picture of Naomi from the LP inner sleeve:

I bought the LP direct from Damon & Naomi in 2013 at the same time as I pre-ordered the [Wondrous World bootleg edition](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/06/23/my-record-collection-the-wondrous-world-of-damon-naomi-bootleg-edition/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=newsletter+20250725). I paid $12 which was a bargain then... and can still be bought from [Damon & Naomi's online store for just $15](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/p/damon-naomi-the-earth-is-blue) which is even more of a bargain if you take inflation into account, expecially for something *this beautiful*.

## Füxa - Covered in Stars (LP)

So Füxa put in their final appearance in this series with their most recent record from 2022... although I believe Randall is working on another Füxa album so I wouldn't be surprised if he/they squeezed in again before this series wraps up.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/fuxa-covered-in-stars-lp.jpg" "Füxa - Covered in Stars (LP)" %}

Covered in Stars is an album of the electronic spacey goodness you would expect and has sleeve credits for Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips, although no clues as to where they turn up, although that's Britta singing on the opening track and I suspect that'll be Dean playing guitar on it? 

The album is a picture disc, although still comes in a printed sleeve - the record itself gives no clear declaration of which is the A and which is the B side, and even resorting to tilting the LP at the right angle and reading the matrix numbers doesn't help since the number on side A ends with a B, and the number on side B ends with an A!

Actually I've just noticed that the album has an A side and an AA side - so it's a double a-side album! Of course it's not it may think it is but it has an A side (called A) and a B side (called AA)!

My pressing is very crackly - I hadn't noticed before... maybe I didn't listen to it when I bought it and just went straight to the download?

Füxa release their records on fab London indie Rocket Girl who shortly before this release had celebrated the 20th anniversary of it's "first release proper" with a lovely (if mostly impossible to read) [book, with a compilation CD, a Mogwai flexidisc, and a Bardo Pond / Azusa Plane 7"](https://variousartists19.bandcamp.com/album/rocket-girl-20) - a lovely muddle of formats!

 - *Catalogue Number:* AHFOW 12/093
 - *Artist:* Füxa
 - *Title:* Covered in Stars
 - *Packaging:* Picture disc in printed sleeve
 - *Format:* LP
 - Bought direct from Rocket Girl for £20
 - [Buy 'Covered in Stars' on Bandcamp](https://fuxaband.bandcamp.com/album/covered-in-stars)
