Liner Notes (from Schemer release)
Is it a band or a new astronomical configuration? Music is the backbeat of
the spheres; and for once American Space travel pays off. From the furthest
reaches of space, that is, Kramer's Noise New York Studio, float a few
celestial riffs and spooky knocks. The lyrics were picked up by antenna. And
only Kramer knows what else snuck in while the channels were open. On Saturn
they're only just pickin' up the signal. And the bartender says: these guys
have a sound. The sound is Today. A few light years away, but it's still now.
Flying out of the mystery and back in your life. By laser beam.
-Mickey Zebulon.

   o When Will You Come Home

These mysterious and spellbinding Bostonians are experts non pareil at
weaving together dreamy, soft and inviting instrumental strands that are
intoxicating in their subtle gorgeousness, with a layer of electric gristle
beneath the Velvety surface. The follow-up to last year's debut brow-raiser
TODAY, "When Will You Come Home" sports in spades the spacious, hypnotizing
flow that's been sprouting them many rabid fans, and will be included in
their upcoming full-length broodpiece, ON FIRE.

   o Flowers (recorded live in Amsterdam)

"Nineteen for the Nineties" compilation with Lush, Pale Saints, Mazzy Star...
Their sound dwells on the silences left lingering after the Velvets' third
album...the hum of ageless youth daydreaming.
