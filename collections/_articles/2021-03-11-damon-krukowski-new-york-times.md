When all our calendars went blank last March, I think many musicians dove into Zoom out of pure reflex; it was like looking for a place to hang out after soundcheck. We are used to killing time, and we’re accustomed to doing that together.

Zoom turns out to be a lousy place for music, though. Its designers boast that it has the lowest latency — the delay between your actions and when they register for others — in the industry; they aim to keep it below 150 milliseconds. This sounds good until you learn that for music, the maximum workable latency is considered to be about 10 milliseconds, beyond which the cues between musicians break down. (As a drummer, I find even 10 too much.) This isn’t just being fussy — try clapping along with your own image on Zoom, and I guarantee you won’t even be able to keep time with yourself.

So this year I have been hanging out on Zoom with musicians and not playing music. Instead, we’ve been doing what Zoom was designed for: conferencing. This is a new activity for most of us. Musicians generally don’t have business meetings, at least not with one another. What happens when you put us in a virtual conference room together? The same thing that happens whenever you gather a group of workers: We organize.

The Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (U.M.A.W.) could probably have come about only in a year without touring. Normally, musicians who don’t regularly play together cross paths only briefly, when we share a stage or pass through one another’s hometowns. We’re too itinerant for regular get-togethers; there are roadies who don’t even bother having permanent addresses. But with all of us at home, scheduling Zoom meetings proved easy. Musicians contacted other musicians. We talked about the situation we’d found ourselves in and what we might do about it.

At the first meeting, in April, I knew only a few people in the virtual room — mostly the members of the political punk band Downtown Boys. There were others I knew from their music, though we’d never met: Sadie Dupuis from the band Speedy Ortiz; Ryan Mahan from Algiers; Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo, or SAMMUS; Cole Smith from DIIV. Then there were many whose music I would learn about only as I got to know them. Musicians are fast at forming bonds. I think the intensity of our relationships mirrors the intensity of our work: You get to know someone very well and very quickly in the close confines of a stage or a van.

Soon we were comparing notes on our industry. Ever since streaming took hold a decade ago, the only real income many of us can earn is through performance. When the pandemic shuttered venues, it threw us all out of work. Musicians still made music, of course; many have managed to record and release new material during lockdown. But few have any hope of earning much money from that labor. Streaming now represents some 80 percent of all revenue for recorded music, and it’s not a great proposition for artists. Spotify, for instance, doesn’t pay on a per-stream basis, but the U.M.A.W. calculated that each stream is worth, on average, about $0.0038. In order to earn the equivalent of a $15-per-hour job, you’d need 657,895 streams of your music per month — for each person in your band.

The first band my partner Naomi Yang and I were in, Galaxie 500, sees about three-quarters of a million monthly streams on Spotify, which earns the three members about $1,000 each. That’s for material we own outright. Typically, the money a band brings in will be shared not just with a label, but with producers, with managers — all the labor it takes to get a recording heard. You might need tens, even hundreds of millions of streams per month to make a living wage, something only the very top of the industry’s pyramid can expect.

This state of affairs will be painfully familiar to workers in many industries. Musicians are just the original “gig” workers: Like Uber drivers, we’re independent contractors who bear the cost of our own tools, health care and self-employment taxes, while the corporations that control access to our work take in billions in revenue. Spotify saw its stock more than double in value during the pandemic; it is currently capitalized to the tune of $54 billion.

All year, locked out from touring, we did what workers before us have done. We researched and talked about our industry’s structure and made plans — things we would never have been able to do from the back of a van. Our first action was to join many other organizations in successfully lobbying Congress to include gig workers in pandemic unemployment assistance. The second, started in October, is called Justice at Spotify: a set of demands asking the company to include musicians’ material interests in its goals and practices.

Working with other musicians to help build the U.M.A.W. has, for me, been an uplifting experience in depressing times. Many of the other members are close to half my age, and I’ve been continually inspired by their energy, their care for one another, their fury at injustice. Passions sometimes spill over, as they do in bands, but the way these younger musicians model both giving and demanding respect is something I don’t remember learning so well anywhere else — definitely not in my era’s indie-rock scene, anyway.

It’s been a relief simply to have space for hanging out with other musicians at all — a theme many of our recent meetings have turned to. Musicians are, almost to a one, very social beings. That’s why we form bands. We can’t play music now in the ways we are used to. But we can, my comrades and I have discovered, still work together.
