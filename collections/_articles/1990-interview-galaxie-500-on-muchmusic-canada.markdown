  * MuchMusic (Canada) TV interview transcript

This was broadcast on Canada's answer to MTV, MuchMusic, and interspersed with
short live clips of a Toronto gig. I'm going by a cassette dub and it's hard
to hear what's said sometimes due to traffic passing outside the window (on
the tape, not in my house) & tape hiss. Hopefully I've identified all the
speakers correctly.

(starts with live bit of "Fourth of July")

**Dean**: My voice... Kinda whiney, I would say. Untrained. Ummm...

(laughter from Naomi)

**Interviewer**: It's a wild voice.

**Dean**: Well, thank you... I'm pleased you like it.

**Interviewer**: You've got a lot of guts.

(much laugher from everyone)

**Dean**: Got a lot of guts... Was that yet another veiled insult?

**Damon**: I think it was a compiliment.

**Interviewer**: Definitely a compliment

**Dean**: There's reviews that say I have a Neil Young fixation, which is
rediculous. I have one of his records, but none of us are like big Neil Young
fans.

**Interviewer**: Who are you fans of?

**Damon**: The old Manchester scene: Joy Division... (silent) That was the whole
scene...

**Dean**: No it wasn't. Magazine.

**Dean/Damon**: Buzzcocks.

**Naomi**: Not really all that New Wave stuff.

**Damon**: Some of it.

**Naomi**: We like the Clash.

(bit of live "Decomposing Trees")

**Interviewer**: Is there a lot of pressure then when you go onstage toperform
live to...

**Dean**: To not be mellow?

**Interviewer**: Yeah.

**Naomi**: It kind of feels like that just because of "performing" - I mean,it's
not as... I mean, it's not as.... sort of... as laid back as therecords in the
same way. It's just rawer or something, anyway....

**Damon**: I think there's pressure in the sense that it's usuallyinappropriate in
a club. You don't really feel like being as delicate asyou might on a
recording. And maybe you feel more like being a little bitmore outgoing and
pushing it a little louder, cause it's nighttime and everybody's out to have a
good time.

**Interviewer**: So how do you want people to react to your music.

**Dean**: Ummm... Ecstatically.

(clip of audience applauding)

**Naomi**: When we play really quietly, the chatting can be very loud, and it's
distracting.

**Damon**: It's better when people listen.

**Naomi**: Yeah.

**Damon**: They usually do. They usually seem to get drawn in.

**Dean**: It's weird, sometimes between songs it's just like silent...

**Damon**: Yeah.

**Dean**: ...which is a really strange sensation to be in a crowded club andall of
a sudden have it be, like, silent. It's unnerving.
