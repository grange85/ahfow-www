TAKING time off from their day jobs in Luna, Britta Phillips and Dean Wareham create a laid-back version of that band's sound, with slightly less shimmer and a little more smoochiness, augmented by strings, vibes and extra fairy dust from the producer Tony Visconti (who seems to be working as hard these days as he did back in his 1970s Bowie'n'Bolan heyday). Original songs are mixed in with an eclectic bunch of covers that range from the Doors to the Silver Jews via Buffy Sainte-Marie. The best nonoriginal is a version of Madonna's I Deserve It, which rescues the song from its original Mirwais production. Slight and perhaps even a little twee at first, L'Avventura will gradually work its way under your skin.
