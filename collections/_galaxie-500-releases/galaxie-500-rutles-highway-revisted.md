Produced and Engineered by Kramer at Noise New York 1990
20 track compilation with Unrest, Bongwater, Shonen Knife, Daniel Johnston, etc.
From liner notes (a supposed interview with ex-Rutle Ron Nasty (Neil Innes))...
Debbie: - O.K., here's the first track. It's by GALAXIE 500.
Ron: - Another bloody sequel! Which one have they done?
Debbie: - Cheese and Onions
Ron: - I like the start, I think this lot have got something, probably constipation, they're obviously high on laxatives...yep, they're speeding up...heading for the lavatory...aaaahh...nope! Ah well, back to the laxatives.
