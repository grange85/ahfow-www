Session recorded for KXLU show Part Time Punks.

The date is transmission date. 

Recorded at Jason Quever's Palmetto Recording Studio in autumn 2019.

> Back in the fall of 2019 Britta, Roger and I recorded some Galaxie 500 songs for the Part Time Punks radio show that airs weekly at KXLU here in Los Angeles. Jason Quever engineered the session at his Palmetto Recording Studio (Jason also plays some electric guitar, including a nifty solo on "When Will You Come Home"). For April we are posting three songs from that session: "Flowers," "Victory Garden" and "When Will You Come Home."
