<p>Damon & Naomi are releasing another limited edition DVD of their live show. Recorded over two nights in Tokyo Japan the DVD is available to pre-order on their website and all orders will be shipped on 5 December and should arrive in time for the holidays.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Hiroo] Ishihara has now cut together tracks from those two January nights in Tokyo, to make a document of our 2007/8 live show. There is no overlap in material from our previous DVD of 2005. This new set features a number of songs from Within These Walls; but also several older songs we don't usually play, which our Japanese hosts had requested (reaching all the way back to This Car Climbed Mt. Washington, from More Sad Hits).</p></blockquote>
