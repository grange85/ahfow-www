<p>Britta has just posted <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=178">her summer blog post</a> over at deanandbritta.com</p>
<blockquote><p>Just spent two days in Bryce Gogginsâ€™ Trout Studio in Brooklyn recording a bunch of tracks for the Warhol Screen Tests. Tomorrow, we will rehearse Galaxie 500 songs for our show on Thursday. It has been a busy summer. Not enough time for reading or movies, although I have been enjoying the Olympics this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Calling it a "summer blog" of course implies we'll only get four a year so enjoy it :)</p>
