I dug out my copy of Luna's cover of Everybody's Talkin' that was out out on Sub Pop's singles club back in the day. It's a gem, of course, but you knew that.

What you mightn't have known is that the demo version Of Fuzzy Wuzzy that was on the flip is also rather special. A six minute meandering drawl of a version, that still seems to end too soon.

This was recorded from my vinyl using my very rudimentary set-up so you have the joy of listening to it the way I do!
