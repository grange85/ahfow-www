<p class="lead"> If you're not <a href="/database/luna/shows/">down-under where Luna are currently touring</a>, you're probably kicking your heels waiting (or crossing your fingers hoping) for Luna to come by (or come back) on their reunion tour. Here's a treat to fill the waiting and/or hoping...</p>

Youtube user [3.Cameras.and.a.Microphone](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8tAnV9M2FKiJF2pDbXU0hw) has recently been uploading some video masters to YouTube, as well as the previously available show from the show from [92 at the Whisky a Go Go in LA](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/shows/1992/1992-11-05-luna-whiskey-a-go-go-los-angeles-ca-usa/) (which is now available in much better quality than previous uploads - in five parts [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOzrVW5HUVI) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEyJV3z2_k) [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urYEA-3jTe8) [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ldujrgwvlo) [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV65bUtHuFU)) there are two shows from consecutive nights from 1994.

First up from the [Casbah in San Diego on 12 July 1994](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/shows/1994/1994-07-12-casbah-san-diego-ca-usa/)

... and the next night at the [Coach House, San Juan Capistrano](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/shows/1994/1994-07-13-luna-coach-house-los-angeles-ca-usa/)

<p class="lead" id="2015-09-16-more">OK - another one has just turned up, this one from Luna's first US tour in 1992, and this is a treat (of sorts)&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Long Beach, California we played a horrid little club called Bogart's on a triple bill with Screaming Trees and Celibate Rifles[...]</p>
<p>When we finally tool the stage, a long-haired guy with a mustache stood directly in front of me.</p>
<p>"Kick out the jams!" he yelled, before we had played a note.</p>
<p>And again after our first, "Come on, motherfuckers! Kick out the jams!"</p>
<p>He was annoyed. Luna didn't rock hard enough for him. He kept his chatter up all set long. After the last song I told him to go fuck himself, and he challenged me to a fight right then and there. Luckily for him, Stanley pulled me away.</p>

You can see this all play out, and Justin, not Stanley, pulling Dean away at the end.
