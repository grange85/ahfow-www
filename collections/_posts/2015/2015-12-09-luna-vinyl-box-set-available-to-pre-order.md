<p class="lead">The long awaited vinyl box-set containing Luna's first five LPs plus a bonus LP of rarities, is now available to pre-order.</p>
<p>Brooklyn label Captured Tracks have announced that because of "overwhelming demand" they are opening up pre-orders for the box set now ahead of its release in February or March.</p>
<p><a class="btn btn-primary" href="http://www.omnianmusicgroup.com/products/long-players-92-99-6xlp-box-set">Pre-order the box set from Captured Tracks</a></p>
<p>The LPs will be pressed in 150g white vinyl and is limited to 2000 copies worldwide - <a href="/database/luna/releases/luna-long-players-92-99/">the full track listing for the box can be found here</a>. The five studio albums will be released on black vinyl spearately later.</p>

<blockquote><p>Due to overwhelming demand, we have decided to open up EARLY pre-orders for the Luna Long Players Box Set. Typically, we wait until we have more concrete arrival dates for a collection such as this, but some of you seem to be a bit worried that you won't have an opportunity to own this, which we understand.</p>
<p>With that being said, this Box Set's target date to arrive is Feb/March. It will ship as soon as it arrives in our warehouse. This is an early pre-order and, if you have reservations, we ask you to hold off. We will be updating all pre-order customers bi-weekly (or every two weeks) on progress. People who pre-order will be sent messages with photos and more. International customers, this Box Set is HEAVY. We recommend finding an international courier service for reduced shipping rates.</p></blockquote>
