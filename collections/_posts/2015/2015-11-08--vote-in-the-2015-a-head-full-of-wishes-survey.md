<p class="text-success">Update: Just to confirm that I will be pulling a couple of names out of the hat to win prizes, so if you want the chance to win a poster, or a single, or some other goodies as yet undetermined then you need to vote (and include your email address when asked).</p>

<p class="text-center lead"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DkGhsGsl3FvRbq5DWTg-pU820TDD-ZcQYDjjAN_eGvc/viewform" class="btn btn-primary">Vote in the 2015 survey</a></p>

<p class="lead">This year is the 20th anniversary of the A Head Full of Wishes survey<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>, so head on over to this form and pic your favourite albums snf tracks by Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon & Naomi, Dean & Britta and Dean Wareham.</p>
<p>This years form is a little simpler but does reuire a bit more typing as you'll be writing down your favourite tracks rather than picking them out from a list.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I have much to offer as a prize this year - so you'll have to do it for the love of A Head Full of Wishes, or the love of numbers (that's why I do surveys!)</p>

<p class="text-muted" id="footnote-1">[1] The eagle-eyed among you may have noted that last year's survey was billed as "the 20th" - this year's however is the 20th <em>anniversary</em> of the first survey - I can find something to celebrate every year!</p>
