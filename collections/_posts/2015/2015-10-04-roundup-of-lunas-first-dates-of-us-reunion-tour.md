<p class="lead">On Friday and Saturday Luna played the first dates of the US leg of their reunion tour. The first shows were in Atlanta and Friday night's show started with them playing their classic 1995 album Penthouse from start to finish (including the hidden bonus track). Here's a quick round-up on what you can see and read about the first dates.</p>

<p><a href="http://shokai2.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/luna-at-terminal-west-atlanta-october-2.html">Music Disolves Water</a> has posted a review and a bunch of pictures, and a rumination on the "bros" in the audience</p>
<blockquote>"Luna's back, man!" one bro shouted repeatedly to no one in particular while waiting for an open stall in the men's room before the encore. No one gave a high five to his upheld hand because we were in the men's room and, you know, germs.

<blockquote>Great vibe from the stage, bouncing right back from the audience to the band, beginning with the first note of the show all the way to the last.</blockquote>
