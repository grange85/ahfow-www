After more than ten years as a Wordpress blog, A Head Full of Wishes now isn't.

It will hopefully be better (but I have the WP site backed up... just in case it's a flipping disaster) - but things will almost certainly have gone astray in the move - things will be broken, missing, not working. But mostly it'll be as it was before - but hopefully quicker.

One thing that has gone are the comments - I do still have them all (and I may reintroduce them, but not yet). I've replaced this with Faecbook comments. It's not perfect but it works quite well and Facebook is certainly the place where most of AHFoW's discussion already happens so it seemed a sensible option. If you're not a Facebook-er - I'm sorry - I really am. You can still [contact me using other channels](/about/), email, twitter, and even by post!

Feedback is welcomed - both good and bad - and I'll try and fix things!

Thanks for bearing with me.
