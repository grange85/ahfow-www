<p class="lead">Today is Damon's birthday - he'll be spending it in <a href="/database/damon-and-naomi/shows/2015/2015-09-07-damon-and-naomi-veloso-seoul-south-korea/">Seoul, South Korea ahead of Damon & Naomi's show there tomorrow evening</a>.</p>

Here's a lovely video of Damon & Naomi playing Turn of the Century in front of an enormous screen in Seattle a few months back.

Damon is currently working on a book about music and technology and it's worth following him on <a href="http://twitter.com/dada_drummer">Twitter (@dada_drummer)</a> and <a href="http://internationalsadhits.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> for his ruminations and insights into the subject.

You can also catch up on his work beyond Damon & Naomi on his <a href="http://www.dadadrummer.com/">new website dadadrummer.com</a>.

<blockquote>It’s a book that uses the facts—and not terribly obtuse ones—of music technology, things anyone who has been in a band or been in a studio knows, but others may not. I’m using these things to think through changes in our communication patterns with one another both musical and non-musical ways—essentially, using audio, because it’s what I know best, to think about our social relations and how that has been affected by the shift from analog to digital. It’s not an anti-digital book, and it’s not a pro-digital book. It’s just a look at what some of these changes we’ve experienced might mean.

Have a great day Damon!
