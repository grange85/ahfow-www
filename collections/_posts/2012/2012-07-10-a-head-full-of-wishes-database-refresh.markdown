<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/9400848/" title="I wrote a poem on a cat biscuit by andyaldridge, on Flickr"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/6/9400848_f8732840fa.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="I wrote a poem on a cat biscuit"></a></p>
<p>Just because I had the time I decided to work on updating the <a href="/database/">A Head Full of Wishes database</a> (discography, gigography, etc.) - so far it pretty much does exactly what it used to but over the coming months I have plans to add more - but just in case you've forgotten (or was unaware) of what there was, here's a reminder...</p>
<p>A pretty full discography of Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon & Naomi, Dean & Britta and Dean Wareham - still a few gaps and the pictures are a bit tiny.</p>
<p>An incomplete (but improving all the time) gigography of shows played by Galaxie 500, <a href="/database/database/gigography/luna" title="Luna gigography">Luna</a>, Damon & Naomi, Dean & Britta and Dean Wareham.</p>
<p><strong>Some lists: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A-Z of tracks with guitar chords/tab</li>
<li>A-Z of albums/releases</li>
<li>A-Z of tracks</li>
<li>A-Z of cover versions (tracks covered by the bands rather than other bands covers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Still to do</strong><br />
Definitely...</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the above</li>
<li>Get the pictures bigger and better</li>
<li>Posters, photos and setlist scans for shows (I have a load not yet up there)</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe...</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to comment on shows, tracks, albums - I tried this before but it wasn't really taken up - but like the idea of it.</li>
<li>Ability to create a "collection" of records you have and/or shows you were at?</li>
</ul>
<p>Open to suggestions.</p>
