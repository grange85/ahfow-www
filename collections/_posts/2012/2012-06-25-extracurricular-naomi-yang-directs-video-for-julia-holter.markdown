<p>I only just noticed that I never posted about the lovely video that Naomi made for the track Our Sorrows from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007BS10NU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007BS10NU">Julia Holter's recent album Ekstasis</a><br />
. The video was <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/46689-video-julia-holter-our-sorrows/">premiered on Pitchfork at the end of May</a> and on their site Naomi outlined the vision for the video:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was intrigued by the lyric in the chorus: "If you call out, I will follow." It didn't seem to me that it was a statement of devotion addressed to a lover, but more about Julia listening for inner direction. When I mentioned this idea to Julia, she emphatically agreed. She said that she often thinks of her music as something that is inside her, almost like an intuition that she allows to lead her.</p></blockquote>
