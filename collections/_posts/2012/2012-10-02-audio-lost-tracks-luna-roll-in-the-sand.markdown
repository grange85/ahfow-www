Luna's Outdoor Miner 7" came in a gatefold sleeve giving all the more space to show the delightful image of a cat nailed to a board <strong>three</strong> times! The lead track is available to buy on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00122K2NA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00122K2NA&linkCode=as2&tag=aheadfullofwi-20">download-only compilation Lunafied</a> or on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001MYDKVY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B001MYDKVY&linkCode=as2&tag=aheadfullofwi-21">The European two disc version of Best of Luna</a><br />

The flip side remained nowhere but on the flip of the 7" (or on the CD single) until now. This was recorded carelessly from my 7" so please be aware that it comes with all the crackles and pops that that entails... if anyone wants to upgrade me to a rip of the CD please <a href="/about/">get in touch</a>!</p>

<p>MP3: <a href="https://www.box.com/s/y65xqz28xecbhkhw3l6q">Luna - Roll in the Sand</a></p>
<p>As a bonus here's a great live version of Outdoor Miner<br />
MP3: <a href="https://www.box.com/s/obclp851qzzol3vbjrrg">Luna - Outdoor Miner (live in NYC 1994)</a></p>
<p>Can't find video of Luna playing it live on YouTube so here's the utterly fab The Feelies (with a little bit of Luna)<br />
