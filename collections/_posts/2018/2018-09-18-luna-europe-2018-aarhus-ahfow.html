<p class="lead">Having taken the hard (and regrettable) decision to skip the shows in Bristol and Hamburg Monday morning was spent traumatically crossing London in rush-hour to get to Stansted and thence to Aarhus for my second luna show of the year.</p>
<p>I knew nothing of Aarhus but it was in the right direction if we wanted to end our tour in Stockholm. After the RyanAir flight (never again) to Aarhus we arrived, grabbed some food and snoozed the afternoon away in our Airbnb.</p>

<p>We arrived at the venue while The Telenovelas were rattling through a sweet and faithful cover of The Go-Betweens Right Here. The stage was low and the room was spacious and airy. It was more comfortable than London which made for a more relaxed feeling show.</p>
<p>Aarhus's surprise was a fantastic Black Postcards, a song that took on a life on Luna's farewell tour of 2004/5 but had pretty much slipped out of the repertoire since their 2015 reunion. "It's never the same twice".</p>
