<p class="lead">The Run Out Groove Records poll last month found Luna's Lunafied coming out as the (no doubt comfortable) winners (well done everyone). The shop is <a href="http://runoutgroovevinyl.com/lunafied-2lp.html">now taking pre-orders</a> for the double vinyl release.</p>

<p>Over on the label's Facebook page they're having <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RunOutGrooveLPs/posts/2180251098877025">a secondary poll on vinyl colour</a> - so feel free to head over there and pick a colour (I wouldn't want to sway the vote but seriously, don't choose C :) it looks like a spliiage)</p>

<p><a href="/database/luna/releases/luna-lunafied-luna-covers/">Lunafied</a> has until now only been available as a digital only release put out by Rhino in 2006 and, in a different form, as the bonus disc with the <a href="/database/luna/releases/luna-best-of-luna/#beggars-banquet-cd">UK edition of Best of Luna</a>. The Run Out Groove copy will include all the tracks from both versions in a double album.</p>
