<p class="lead">We took the train from Copenhagen to Aarhus sharing the carriage/journey with Joakim and Ulrika. We arrived in the rain and went looking for, and eventually finding, food. Always the priority on arrival in a new city.</p>
<p>Luna were playing in Loppen in Freetown Christiana, a strangely bohemian part of the city. We wandered through the drugs stalls and ate falafel and drunk lemonade ~ I'm not sure Freetown was ideal for my uptight-ness. Motorhead's Killed By Death played on a nearby radio.</p>
<p>The venue was low ceilinged and oddly laid out, it had the charm of rock venues of the past - the sort of charm that was better in nostalgia than in reality. It filled up, and heated up.</p>

<p>First up were Echo Ladies, whose recent <a href="https://echoladies.bandcamp.com/album/pink-noise">Pink Noise LP on Sonic Cathedral</a> is a gem, and who I'd managed to miss on their recent visits to London. It was good to get to see them.</p>
<p>Luna played {% ahfowtrack "I Want Everything" %} which I was hoping to get to hear on this tour but hadn't turned up in the two shows so far. I noticed that {% ahfowtrack "Fuzzy Wuzzy" %} had been crossed off the set list. That was a bit sad (luckily Mike also noticed the crossing out and took steps to rectify that in Stockholm).</p>
<p>The band were tight and the crowd were fans - {% ahfowtrack "Chinatown" %} almost drifted into sing-a-long territory. It was a good show - but the heat and the crowds meant when the ending arrived it came as a bit of a relief.</p>
