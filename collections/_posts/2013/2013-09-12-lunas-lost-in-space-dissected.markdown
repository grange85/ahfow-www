<p>Following on from Chris Stroffolino's Piano Van session with Dean & Britta he's <a href="http://chrisstroffolino.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/the-feuerzeig-video-covers-project-luna.html">wriiten a (long!) blog post</a> opening up the song and having a poke around it's innards...</p>
<blockquote><p> As with many songs with catchy, sing along choruses, these lines are often the only lines of the song many casual listeners know, or have made it into long-term memory. They sink in, but on repeated listens, they call attention to the verses, especially if you’re looking for insights into unanswered questions about the significance of the chorus’s words.</p>
<p>The verses are certainly sad; perhaps tragic, but definitely ridden with pathos. The singer is non-judgmental and sympathetic with the struggle the “you” is going through, as if he’s also talking to himself. Since the sadness is at least as present in the second verse (after the chorus) as in the first, it shows how the chorus (despite their now calling you magic) didn’t really change much.</p></blockquote>
