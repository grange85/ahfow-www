<p>I know, it's a Dylan track - but (apparently) Dylan never released a version of it until 1971 whereas The Band's version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Shall_Be_Released">I Shall Be Released</a> was on their debut album Music From The Big Pink in 1968.<br />

It's possibly most famously performed by (almost) everyone in The Last Waltz<br />

<p>Damon & Naomi played it at the first Terrastock with Tom Rapp and that version was released on the All Access CD released with the commemorative edition of Ptolemaic Terrascope.</p>

<p>Even Tom Rapp had released a version before His Bob-ness, on 1969's Pearls Before Swine LP - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Things_Too">These Things Too</a><br />
