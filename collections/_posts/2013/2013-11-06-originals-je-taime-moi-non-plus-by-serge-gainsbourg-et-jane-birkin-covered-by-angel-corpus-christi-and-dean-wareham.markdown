<p>OK, I wasn't entirely sure if this one qualified for the series - it being Dean guesting on Angel Corpus Christi's single - but then I thought, it's my blog and why wouldn't I want to grasp the opportunity to put some top notch French smut on it!?</p>
<p>Serge originally recorded with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Bardot#Politics_and_legal_issues">racist nutjob Brigitte Bardot</a> until her husband found out about it<br />

<p>OK... I think I need a cold bath now</p>
<p>Angel Corpus Christi and Dean covered it for a 7" single released in 1994<br />
