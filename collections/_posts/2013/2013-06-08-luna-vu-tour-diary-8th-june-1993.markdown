## June 8
The Paradiso, Amsterdam. Rumors that Luna will not be able to fit on stage turn out to be false. This is the smallest show on the tour with a capacity of 1200 and no air-conditioning, and there's a heatwave here in Holland. We have a great show - the heat makes us sweat and look like we're really rocking even though we're standing still.

I watch the Velvets' show from the balcony, right on the side of the stage. I'm very lucky I know. Lou is wearing a white cotton headband, and keeps pouring ice over his head. The highlight of the set is "I'm Sticking With You" - when Moe goes back to the drum kit after singing, I get that special feeling.

We briefly attend the after-show party. Lou exits via boat. We go to the Bob Marley Coffeeshop and eat space-cake. I find myself talking loudly about how Haile Selassie is a murderer, and then notice that people are looking at me.

_In April 1993 Luna were invited to open for The Velvet Underground on their reunion tour around Europe. Dean Wareham kept a diary of the tour which was published in the November 1993 issue of Alternative Press, I've just lifted that article and chopped it up into days and will post it here over the coming days - all without permission - if anyone objects give me a shout._
