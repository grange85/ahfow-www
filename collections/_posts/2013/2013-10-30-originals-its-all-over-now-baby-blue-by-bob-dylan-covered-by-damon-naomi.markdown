<p>And his Bobness puts in yet another appearance in this series. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_All_Over_Now,_Baby_Blue">It's All Over Now, Baby Blue</a> put in its first appearance on Dylan's fifth album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bringing_It_All_Back_Home">Bringing it All Back Home</a> in 1965.<br />

<p>And then everyone covered it - <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2012/01/13/one-shot-its-all-over-now-baby-blue/">I blogged about a few of my favourites a couple of years back</a>.</p>
<p>Then in 1999 Damon & Naomi released a fantastic live version on a 7" single recorded with Batoh and Kurihara of Ghost<br />
