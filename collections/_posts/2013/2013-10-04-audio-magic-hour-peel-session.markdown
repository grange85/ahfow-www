<p>After the release of their debut LP More Sad Hits, Damon & Naomi accepted an invitation to be the rhythm section in Kate Biggar and Wayne Rogers new band Magic Hour. The band released three albums over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of May 1994, while Magic Hour were in London promoting their debut album No Excess is Absurd, the band headed into the BBC's Maida Vale studios to record <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1990s/1994/May03magichour/">a session for Radio One's John Peel show</a>. They recorded three songs in a session that was aired a few weeks later and has pretty much been lost to our ears ever since - until now...</p>

<p>Also while in London in 1994... here's a complete Magic Hour set from a show at The Sausage Machine supporting 18th Dye. The show includes a performance of Naomi's only lead vocal contribution to Magic Hour, on a cover of Cyril Tawney's Sally Free and Easy, which I <a href="/2012/03/15/audio-lost-tracks-magic-hour-sally-free-and-easy/" title="Audio: Lost tracks: Magic Hour â€“ Sally Free and Easy">covered in a Lost Tracks post a while back</a>.</p>
