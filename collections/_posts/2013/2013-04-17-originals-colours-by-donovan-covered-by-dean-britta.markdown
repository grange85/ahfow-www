<p>When I bought my first guitar - and cheap Washburn acoustic, I got given a book of easy guitar songs and the first song in the book, and therefore the first song I ever played on the guitar was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colours_%28Donovan_song%29">Donovan's Colours</a> - close to 40 years on I've probably not yet mastered it (or indeed anything on the guitar).</p>
<p>Donovan released Colours as a single in February 1965 and it reached No 4 in the UK charts and has been a staple of his act and covered by pretty much everyone. Here's Donovan's single and a couple of other versions... including Dean & Britta's which turned up on their single of Words You Used to Say in 2006.<br />

<p>Here's Donovan with the lovely Nana Mouskouri (I grew up in a house full of Nana Mouskouri's albums)<br />
