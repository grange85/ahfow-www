<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kayaker1204/5429041601/" title="Be Mine by kayaker1204, on Flickr"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5173/5429041601_4b40a84e41_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Be Mine"></a><br />
Cagney and Lacee were Dean Wareham and his then wife Claudia Silver. They released a mini album of covers and a couple of singles in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>The opening track on Cagney and Lacee's only album Six Feet of Chain is called "Be Mine" and is credited to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Rev">Martin Rev</a>. Now Mr Rev, of fab noisy electronic duo Suicide, did indeed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og6Xxn0ANxw">release a track called Be Mine</a>, it was on his album "See Me Ridin'" from 1996 - but the track "Be Mine" on Cagney and Lacee's 1997 album isn't a cover of that! No, Cagney and Lacee's "Be Mine" is actually a cover of "Yours Tonight" another track on "See Me Ridin'"</p>
<p>Again, not on YouTube so,</p>
<p>For Spotify users:<br />

<p>Not sure whether this was a mistake or intentional - I've decided it was a test for fans, one that I failed utterly completely by not discovering it until 15 years after Six Feet of Chain was released!</p>

Update (14th July 2020): Currently on YouTube, so...
