Dean has long-expressed his love for Paisley Underground's finest Opal, a band that featured Dave Roback and Kendra Smith, when the blog Aquarium Drunkard asked Dean for a list of ten albums that inspired Galaxie 500, Opal's only album Happy Nightmare Baby was in the list.</p>
<p>Hear The Wind Blow only appeared on the CD issue of the long out-of-print collection of obscurities Early Recordings released after the band split in 1989.<br />
