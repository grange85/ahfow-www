Damon & Naomi will be joining Yo La Tengo's "Swing State Tour" for four dates at the end of this month.YLT describe the tour as follows..."The format of the shows will be relatively informal and changeable. Guest musicians, singers and comedians will participate in a loose, single performance, coming and going from the stage, playing on each other's songs etc. The shows will provide a forum for the band and their friends to share their political views in an entertaining fashion, with the hope of helping mobilize people to vote for the right candidate on 2 November."See the forthcoming dates section for details of the shows.
