<p>Ride Into the Sun - Luna with Lou Reed<br />In 1996 Luna supported Lou Reed on the North American leg of his "Set The Twilight Reeling" world tour - this months track is from a performance at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston on (I believe) the 30 March and features Lou Reed joining Luna for a rather wonderful rendition of the Velvet Underground track "Ride Into the Sun". The track was played as part of Lou's set (so I guess technically this is Luna joining Lou). Lou and Dean share the vocals.</p>
