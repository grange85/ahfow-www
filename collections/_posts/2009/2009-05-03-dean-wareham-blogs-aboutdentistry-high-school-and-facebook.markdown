<p>Another post on Dean's blog over at deanandbritta.com covers a lot of subject matter so I won't try and rehash it here but sugeest you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090503+/http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=321">head over there to get the latest news</a>...I will put in an extract just to make this item seem a little more substantial...</p>
<blockquote><p>Thursday night I went to the premiere and after-party for the new Jim Jarmusch film. Bill Murray was there (he’s in the film for about a minute near the end) and Tilda Swinton, and Gibby Haynes from the Butthole Surfers (who is not in the film). I don’t know any of those people</p></blockquote>
