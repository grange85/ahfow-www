The album will be released on <a href="http://www.20-20-20.com/">20|20|20 records</a>. Tracklisting to follow (as soon as I have it) but in the meantime you can <a href="http://stereogum.com/archives/mp3/damon-naomi-revisit-the-sub-pop-years_081451.html">read an item and download an mp3 of The Great Wall over on Stereogum</a>.</p>
