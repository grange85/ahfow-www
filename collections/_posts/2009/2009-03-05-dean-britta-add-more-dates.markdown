<p><a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?page_id=218">Dean & Britta's website</a> has added more "13 Most Beautiful" dates. A late show has been added at the ICA in Boston on the 21st of March and three dates in June in <a href="http://www.johnnybrendas.com/index.php">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="http://www.blackcatdc.com/schedule.html">Washington DC</a> and <a href="http://lepoissonrouge.inticketing.com/evinfo.php?eventid=32710">New York</a>. I'm not exactly sure of the format of these addtional shows because they are in more traditional rock venues and the show in New York has Cheval Sombre supporting which implies that it might be a regular Dean & Britta performance rather than a 13 Most Beautiful one. I'll try and confirm.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've had confirmation that the shows in June will NOT be "13 Most Beautiful" performances but regular Dean & Britta shows</p>
