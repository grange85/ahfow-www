<p class="lead">If you were thinking of throwing some money the way of the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/"><abbr title="American Civil Liberties Union">ACLU</abbr></a> (and now seems like it might be the right time to do that), one way you can do that would be to buy this benefit compilation <a href="https://gezelligrecords.bandcamp.com/album/is-there-another-language">Is There Another Language?</a> that feature's Dean & Britta's cover of Hey Paula.</p>
<p>The album has been released on Bandcamp - the VERY limited cassette version has sold out but you can buy the download which has stacks of other great music - the price is $7 but of course you can pay more.</p>
<p>Hey Paula was previosuly only available on the long sold out and saucy covered <a href="/database/dean-and-britta/dean-wareham-releases/dean-wareham-dont-think-twice-hey-paula/">Great Pop Supplement 7"</a> from last year.</p>
