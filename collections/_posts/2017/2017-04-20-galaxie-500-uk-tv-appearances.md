<p class="lead">A video of Galaxie 500 being interviewed on UK telly promoting On Fire has just turned up on YouTube, this goes alongside other UK appearances that have been around for a while&hellip;</p>

<p>This tells us two things&hellip;</p>
<ul>
	<li>The UK really did love Galaxie 500!</li>
	<li>Music on telly was so much better back then, can you imagine Galaxie 500 getting on national TV now!?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, enough of me moaning - enjoy the clips:</p>
