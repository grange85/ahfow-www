<p>If you haven't been watching closely (or haven't "pledged") you might have missed things happening on <a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/luna2/">Luna's Pledgemusic</a>. If you've not pledged this is what you can get in addition to an album for as little as a tenner!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/luna2/updates/85364">A non album track to download</a>! Luna covered a Monochrome Set obscurity. Inside Your Heart is&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>a very early song by London's Monochrome Set â€” possibly when they were called the B-Sides and featured one Stuart Goddard (Adam Ant) on bass guitar.</blockquote>
<p>There is also some video of Luna in the studio recording the song.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/luna2/updates/87111">A lovely shaky video of Justing joining Luna</a> on stage in Wellington, plus some soundcheck footage in Auckland. And a goat. On a roof. Obviously.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/luna2/updates/86830">Video of Dean listening to the album and EP test pressings</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/luna2/updates/87531">Another Luna "Stoner Jam" to download</a>&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>Okay, so there are only a handful of these and they're pretty loose and sloppy but, hey&hellip; that's what a stoner jam is all about&hellip; exploratory noodling&hellip; and this one has a nice little germ of an idea in the middle and gives you an idea of how stuff happens.</blockquote>

<p>&hellip; and posters, cymbals, and socks!</p>
