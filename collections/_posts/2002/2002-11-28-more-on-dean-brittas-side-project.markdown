Not really news just a slight filling out on what Dean & Britta are up to garnered (once again) from Tony Visconti's web site - here's the quote..."I am currently working on an album with Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips of Luna. This is a side project for them and they haven't given their splinter group a name yet. The music style is Dream Pop, with lush sonic landscapes and seductive vocals. The songs are divided into self-written and exotic covers."
