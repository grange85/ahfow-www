<div>Dean has written a short tribute to Tuli Kupferberg on the Dean & Britta blog along with a couple of audio clips.
<p />
<div style="margin-left: 40px">Tuli Kupferberg, singer with the Fugs, poet, cartoonist and long-time peace activist, passed away last week at age 86. Kramer produced  and released an album (<em>Tuli & Friends</em>) with him on Shimmy Disc in 1989, and Kramer liked to say that Tuli was the wisest person he had ever met. My last contact with Mr. Kupferberg was a couple of years ago when I called him about reprinting the lyrics for his amusing anti-war song “Kill For Peace” in <em>Black Postcards</em>. </div>
