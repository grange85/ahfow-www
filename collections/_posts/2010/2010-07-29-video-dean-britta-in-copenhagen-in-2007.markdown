A couple of videos of complete songs from Dean & Britta's secret Copenhagen show from 2007 have just appeared on YouTube. 

First them doing Luna's Chinatown

And then doing Adam Green's We're Not Supposed to be Lovers

If you look back through the [morkygorky's earlier videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/morkygorky) you can find some short clips of other songs from the show earlier in the day.
