No idea where I bought this, and for how much. For some reason I'm thinking Selectadisc in Berwick Street - but it could have been anywhere. In fact by 2002 it could have been bought online.

The CD sleeve was designed to look like a match book and everytime I pick it up I want it to be exactly like a match book - but no, it's just an ordinary digipack CD. It does have a sticker on the sleeve that makes it look a bit more like a matchbook - but the sticker is actually there to hide a printing error - when the sleeves came back from the printers it read "Close Cover Before Before Striking" - [there are some promos, in plain card sleeves, with the mistake](https://www.discogs.com/release/4840455-Luna-Close-Cover-Before-Striking). Although, was it really a mistake or was it a change of mind? I quite like the "Before Before", and seems strange that the _error_ made it through promo and full release QA?

The CD was released in October 2002 and has seven tracks, mostly outtakes from the Romantica sessions - and also included pretty low-res videos for Lovedust and 1995.

The [EP is on Luna's Baandcamp](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/close-cover-before-striking) with a couple of extra tracks ... but no videos. But you can see the videos - in all their low-res-ness on YouTube:
