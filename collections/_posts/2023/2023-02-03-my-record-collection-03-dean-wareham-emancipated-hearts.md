The CD of Dean's first solo album (yes, it's an album as far as I'm concerned - I may ruminate on this later in the series) - this came out on the wonderful Sonic Cathedral back in October 2013. My copy was scrounged off Nat at Sonic Cathedral when I ordered the 10" version - I must admit that I don't really like soliciting freebies but do occasionally if I'm feeling mean or poor, or both.

It really and clearly was _for the collection_ since it's still in its cellophane wrapper - the vinyl, that I paid for, gets played often.
