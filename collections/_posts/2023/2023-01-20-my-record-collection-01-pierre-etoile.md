So, here's the first random entry from my record collection and, in what will probably turn out to be an unusual turn of events, I can actually remember where I bought this one. 

On 8th April 1991, three days after their last show [Galaxie 500 split](/2021/04/05/the-end-of-galaxie-500-30-years-on/). 

In June, just two months later, the Pierre Etoile EP was released by Rough Trade. The first post-Galaxie 500 release by any of the members. The EP was actually recorded before the split and contains three songs - all sung by Damon. It was a considered decision to not have Naomi sing, supposedly to distance the release from Galaxie 500.

> We were conscious of trying not to undermine the band any further [... s]o we strived to make it as different as possible. That's why we didn't do it with Kramer and I didn't sing, etc. etc  
> _Naomi Yang - Ptolemaic Terrascope, July 1997_

Shortly after its release I found myself in Vinyl Experience in Buck Street, Camden, paying Â£3.80 for a copy of the EP. I'll have to assume that I must have been hunting it down since it's not obvious from the front of the sleeve that it had anything to do with Galaxie 500 so I probably didn't just luck upon it. Obviously, back then I was a very thorough reader of the music inkies so it's not really a surprise that a heartbroken Galaxie 500 fan was looking for it!

Back then Vinyl Experience had a motorbike mounted through its window - you sort of remember that, which is why I'm surprised not to have found many pictures of it - you can just about see the wheel of the bike behind Wreckless Eric's drummer in [this picture from 1989](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nickhi/2951539479/sizes/h/).

 - In The Sun - this later got re-recorded with Naomi on vocals for D&N's second album Playback Singers. I can't help but love the Naomi version more!
 - Nineteen Sixty-Nine - an almost unbearably fragile song of strums and harmonies.
 - This Car Climbed Mt. Washington - this starts with more gentle fragility but at just after two minutes in things change. The whole EP changes. Damon & Naomi change. It was re-recorded for More Sad Hits and while I love both versions, I have a fondness for this and Damon's "inept lead guitar" _(Damon Krukowski - Ptolemaic Terrascope, July 1997)_
