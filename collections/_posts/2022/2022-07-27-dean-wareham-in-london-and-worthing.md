So, those dates that were due in April 2020 finally happened, such a long wait. The last time I saw Dean in the flesh was outside Debaser in Stockholm in September 2018 - pretty sure I said "hope to see you soon" as I walked away, because I almost always do. Instead it was the longest gap in DW related shows since I first saw him with Galaxie 500 in Subterania in 1990.

On Thursday morning, I packed a bag and took the three hour train ride from my new home in the North East of England to the city of my birth, and of most of my life.
