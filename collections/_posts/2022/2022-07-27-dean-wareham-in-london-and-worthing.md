So, those dates that were due in April 2020 finally happened, such a long wait. The last time I saw Dean in the flesh was outside Debaser in Stockholm in September 2018 - pretty sure I said "hope to see you soon" as I walked away, because I almost always do. Instead it was the longest gap in DW related shows since I first saw him with Galaxie 500 in Subterania in 1990.

On Thursday morning, I packed a bag and took the three hour train ride from my new home in the North East of England to the city of my birth, and of most of my life.

When the tour was first announced there was no new album to pitch so it was sold as Dean Wareham plays Galaxie 500's On Fire and so ... as promised the band played through all the tracks on the album... not in the order they are on the album but it made sense in the live setting to move things around.
