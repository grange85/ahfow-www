Some fantastic video footage has just turned up on YouTube of Damon & Naomi's performance with Tom Rapp at the first Terrastock festival in Providence in April 1997.

It opens with a lovely clip of Damon & Naomi perfoming The New Historicism from their second album [The Wondrous World of Damon & Naomi](/database/damon-and-naomi/releases/damon-and-naomi-wondrous-world/).

This is then followed by them being joined by the late, great Tom Rapp for their wonderful cover of Bob Dylan's I Shall Be Released.

What an absolute joy to see this!
