The fantastic Galaxe 500 oral and visual history book Temperature's Rising is getting a long-overdue second pressing and is available to [order now from 20-20-20 for $30](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/galaxie500-book).

> The book is a very funny, very truthful, and very nostalgic history of Galaxie 500, told directly by the three of us alongside a lot of the people we worked with at the time. Mike McGonigal, a journalist who knew many of the participants, interviewed everyone for the oral history. And Naomi contributed a visual archive of the band, together with her own commentary on those images.
> 
> It's printed in full color, with 214 illustrations. And because the story is told by many voices, it's more than even we knew about that band!
