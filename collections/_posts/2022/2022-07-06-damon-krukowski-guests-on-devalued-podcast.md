Damon Krukowski is the first guest on the new podcast Devalued whose remit is to "talk about art and money and how creative people are navigating the ever changing landscape to make a living for their work" which is bread and butter to Damon. 

> In this debut Devalued episode, Krukowski discusses all of these topics and how artists empowerment is truly a political issue that goes well beyond the imbalance of Spotify payments. His experience with both the indie and major label industries spans decades and his insights are invaluable.

He is of course always well worth a listen - [so check it out](https://weownthistown.net/shows/devalued/is-music-free-a-discussion-with-damon-krukowski/).
