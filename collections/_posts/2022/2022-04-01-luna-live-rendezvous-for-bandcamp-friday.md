Luna have released a live recording of their full Rendezvous show recorded in San Francisco in January 2017.

This is the last of three albums released over three months of Bandcamp Fridays and includes the band playing the full Rendezvous album plus a bonus Fuzzy Wuzzy.

As with the previous releases the album has been mixed by Lee Wall at his studio in Austin, Texas - and sounds brilliant.

You can [checkout and then buy 'Live Rendezvous'](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/live-rendezvous) over on Bandcamp now.

And if you missed it last month you can still buy ['Live Bewitched'](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/live-bewitched) and ['Live Bewitched'](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/live-penthouse) over on Bandcamp too.
