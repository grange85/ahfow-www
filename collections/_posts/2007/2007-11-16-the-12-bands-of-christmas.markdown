<p><a href="http://www.12bandsofchristmas.com/">The 12 Bands of Christmas</a> is an annual charity CD released in Augusta, Georgia in aid of "The Children's Medical Center at The Medical College of Georgia". This year's release, volume 5, is of interest to Luna (and Galaxie 500) fans as it features Night People performing a cover of Galaxie 500's cover of Yoko Ono's "Listen, the Snow Is Falling". Night People is a project of Matthew Buzzell who is of course the director of the Luna documentary "Tell Me Do You Miss Me" and includes contributions from both Sean Eden and Lee Wall.</p>
<p>The CD is launched on 20 November in various retailers around Augusta and will hopefully show up on iTunes at some point. You can read a bit about the CD at The Augusta Chronicle (that's a link to a Google cached page as the Chronicle requires you to register).</p>
<p>Night People are hoping to have an EP together for release in the spring. Here's what Matthew had to say about the project...</p>
<blockquote><p>The project is called Night People.  I am handling the bulk of the song writing and vocal duties as well as grounding the tunes on electric tenor guitar and baritone ukulele.  Sean is, of course, contributing atmospheric leads and Lee the percussive elements.  Lee's ultimate contribution to this project is his skilled and detailed production of the tunes.  We are hoping to have an EP ready by springtime.</p></blockquote>
