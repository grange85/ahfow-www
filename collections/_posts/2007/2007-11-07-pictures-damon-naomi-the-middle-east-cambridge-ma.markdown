Thomas Barrasso sent me a bunch of lovely photos of Damon & Naomi at their recent show in Cambridge MA. I haven't as yet managed to get the pictures bit of A Head Full of Wishes into the new site and it seemed a shame to sit on these so here are a couple of Thomas's gorgeous pictures...

I'll hopefully get the pictures sorted at the weekend and you'll be able to see the rest of these (as well as the hundreds of other photos and scans I've been sent over the years).
