Naomi has just posted to the [Damon & Naomi MySpace Blog](http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=52968500&blogID=327806912)


<blockquote><p>I had considered writing a blog/tour diary on this long, long tour we've been on...[but] I don't have a laptop of my own and I think keeping a blog must require not having to constantly borrow someone else's computer!</p></blockquote>

The European tour dates have been updated on their [MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/damonandnaomi).
