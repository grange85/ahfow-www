<p>I just came across <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081123200339/http://www.derives.net/reviews/review.php?id=1621">this review on derives.net</a> of the "Decomposing" fan tribute album - nice to see it's getting out there...</p>
<blockquote><p>Once this has been said, “Decomposing” features a lot of successful exercises in style. A few contributors have tried to add beats, keyboards or organ but most of them are completely faithful to the originals. So this is a compilation of irreducible fans of Dean Wareham towards irreducible fans of his songwriting. But there are a few gems.</p></blockquote>
