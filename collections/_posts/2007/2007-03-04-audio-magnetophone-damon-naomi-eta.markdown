<p>It's been almost excactly a year since I posted the <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?article_id=132">first track from the Magnetophone</a> demos, so I guess a reminder is in order. Magnetophone was a short-lived project of Damon & Naomi's after Galaxie 500 split up. The band recorded some demos but nothing was officially released, they (apparently) played a couple of gigs and called it a day. As well as Damon & Naomi the band included Jon Williams (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano_Suns">Volcano Suns</a>) on guitar and Chris Guttmacher (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091020114931/http://www.matadorrecords.com:80/bios/bio_bullet.html">Bullet LaVolta</a>) on drums.</p>
<p>This track was labelled "Plane" on the CD I was sent but is actually an early version of <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?track_id=128">E.T.A.</a> that would later turn up on Damon & Naomi's first album More Sad Hits.</p>
<p><em>This Magnetophone are not the same as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetophone">Magnetophone</a> who have released records on 4AD and occasionally feature Spaceman 3's Sonic Boom</em></p>
