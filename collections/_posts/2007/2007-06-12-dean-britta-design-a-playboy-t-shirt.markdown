<p>A bit of old news pinched from <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">Dean & Britta's website</a> that I carelessly missed out. Dean & Britta have designed a T-shirt as part of Playboy's "Rock The Rabbit" campaign. You can buy the cool (if overpriced) T from the Playboy shop an undisclosed portion of the proceeds goes to an AIDS awareness charity <a href="http://www.lifebeat.org/">LIFEbeat</a>. If you like the T go buy it - if you want to help out the charity I'm sure you'd be better off supporting them directly!</p>
