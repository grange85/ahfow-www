[Laika](http://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/track/laika) first appeared on Damon & Naomi's first album [More Sad Hits](/database/damon-and-naomi/releases/damon-and-naomi-more-sad-hits/) but had been recorded earlier for the [short lived outfit Magnetophone](/2006/03/02/audio-magnetophone-laika/).

Here's a recording of Damon & Naomi performing the song at the first Terrastock festival in Providence in April 1997

[Laika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika), of course was one of the Soviet Union's space dogs and was the first living animal to orbit the earth. If you've not already read it I'd highly recommend [the comic Laika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika_(comics)), [Nick Abazdis's lovely re-telling of Laika's story](https://www.nickabadzis.com/laika-graphic-novel) (fictionalised but beautifully and believably told and sprinkled liberally with grains of truth).

If you have already read it I really suggest you go and read the [alternative (and happier) endings](http://www.bigplanetcomics.com/the-alternative-endings-to-laika-show-by-nick-abadzis)!

Recently also the [Vostok 5 project](http://hefnet.com/vostok-5/) was _an exhibition of art and music about people and animals in space_ - the exhibition is over but you can [buy the music over here](https://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/vostok-5).
