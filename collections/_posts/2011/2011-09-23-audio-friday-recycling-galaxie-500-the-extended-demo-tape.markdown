I think I've posted most (although possibly not all) of these tracks separately before but here they are all collected together for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>When the Galaxie 500 Box Set was released in 1996 one of the main treats was the <a href="https://static.fullofwishes.co.uk/galaxie500box/discog1.html">three tracks from Galaxie 500's first demo</a> - what was a little bit of a surprise (to me at least) was to discover a couple of years later that a few of these demo tapes were compiled with four extra tracks - these had a very limited circulation but eventually a copy made it into my grubby paws.</p>
<p>The four extra tracks are as follows </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/g80i2syptmtx6ilv4e2p">Pride</a> (mp3 via Box.net)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/ymhzgcva1h">On the Sofa</a> (mp3 via Box.net)<br />
(featuring Claudia Silver on vocals later <a href="/2007/07/21/audio-cagney-and-lacee-borderline/">Lacee to Dean's Cagney</a> (or was it the other way round?)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/eqatnsmos8">Open Road</a> (mp3 via Box.net)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/3b9xtjuqri">Well All Right</a> (mp3 via Box.net)<br />
A cover of a Buddy Holly track</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to hear the first three tracks - go buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026G7CUM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B0026G7CUM">Uncollected</a> - it has so many gems on it.</p>
