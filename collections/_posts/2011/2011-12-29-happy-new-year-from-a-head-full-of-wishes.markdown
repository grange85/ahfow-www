<p>Hope 2012 brings to you all that you could want and more... for me that includes a gig or two by each of my favourite duos and some new material by Dean and/or Britta (I'd add Damon & Naomi in there but expecting an album every year might seem a little greedy).</p>
<p>Luna's new years eve shows in (or around NYC) became a regular as did their performance of George McCrae's Rock Your Baby at those shows, my (incomplete) gigography has a record of them playing in 1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004.</p>
<p>After the band split up and in the emptiness of New Year's Eve 2005 I put together a <a href="/2005/12/01/audio-roll-your-own-luna-new-year/">Roll Your Own Luna New Year post</a> with a link to a bunch of versions of their cover Rock Your Baby - they're all still there so go check them out.</p>
<p>Alternatively, here's <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?0mu1tpy221s0r1c">the complete recording of their 2000 New Year's Eve show at CBGB's</a>.</p>
<p>... or here's their cover of Shockabilly's Happy New Year first released on the CD version of the Beggars Banquet Hedgehog single<br />
