The results of the 2019 A Head Full of Wishes survey are in - thanks to the 72 folk who responded from 17 different countries. I have been in touch with the two whose names were pulled out of the hat - if you haven't heard from me... better luck next time!

You can see the [summary results](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/fafd5451-6813-405e-972f-e13e7784f295).

## Galaxie 500

Unsurprisingly I guess in the wake of its 30th anniversary On Fire topped the album poll more emphatically than ever. In the votes for favourite track {% ahfowtrack "Fourth of July" %} just edged out {% ahfowtrack "Tugboat" %} and {% ahfowtrack "Strange" %} consolidated its recent strength in third place. Interesting that neither of the top two tracks are from the album that wins so resoundingly - I guess that shows the strength in depth Galaxie 500's catalogue has!

> Because that album just speaks volumes to my soul. Today was the first one I listened to but On Fire just clicked with me.

> Because every single piece of this record is imperfect (voices, guitars, mixing, all) but magically putting all together it sounds perfect


## Luna

Luna's first three albums take the vast majority of the votes again with Penthouse, as ever, winning out. {% ahfowtrack "23 Minutes in Brussels" %} is top track, as it pretty much always has been in recent years!

> Has most of my favorite Luna songs. I really like the fluid rhythm on the tracks with lush, languid guitars.

> it has the best songs! it's where the band seemed to gel.

## Damon & Naomi

More Sad Hits topped the album poll as always - this year leaving the rest of the pack quite far behind. {% ahfowtrack "This Car Climbed Mt. Washington" %} topped the track poll, as it always does - with {% ahfowtrack "E.T.A." %} pushing up behind.

> It was like a gift after Galaxie 500 split. For that it's special for me.

> It's exactly what it says on the tin ;-)

For Dean & Britta and Dean solo [check the full results here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/fafd5451-6813-405e-972f-e13e7784f295) - when I get round to cleaning up the data I'll publish the full spreadsheets if anyone cares!

## Summing up

Thanks again to everyone for contributing - and thanks for so many nice things that were said in the comments box - I don't do it to fish for compliments but it is lovely to get them all the same!
