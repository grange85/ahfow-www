<p class="lead">The music portions of this video of Galaxie 500 playing 120 Minutes turned up on the Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste DVD set a couple of years back - but the interviews on the DVD were from February 1990 when the band were touring with The Sundays.</p>
<p>The videos where repackaged with a new interview and broadcast in June 1990 when the band were over doing the Euro festival circuit.</p>

<p>You'll need to crank up the volume a bit as it's a wee bit quiet in the interviews.</p>

<p>Here's the earlier package as broadcast...</p>

<p><strong>MTV:</strong> When you're making your records what kind of atmospheres are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Dean:</strong> Two parts wimpy, one part atmospheric, one part...</p>
<p><strong>Damon:</strong> Fragility</p>
<p><strong>Dean:</strong> A little dash of pastoral imagery. All that crap</p>
<p><strong>Damon:</strong> It's a formula. We found it in a book actually</p>
