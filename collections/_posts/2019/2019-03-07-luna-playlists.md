<p class="lead">Luna have started curating a series of playlists on Spotify and Apple Music and they're inviting fans to suggest ommisions.</p>
<p>So far they have put together two playlists&hellip;</p>
<p>Luna Essentials is, as its name suggests, an "essential playlist of songs from Luna"</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/doublefeaturerecords/playlist/5Wjd6hlLC17jUc3F37tzqO?si=UZA9guV9TAm9GaiNJyCCQA">Luna Essentials on Spotify</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/luna-essentials/pl.a815624e0640439e902da018aeab3341?at=11lEW&ct=9eq78w">Luna Essentials on Apple Music</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Luna Deep Cuts is a playlist plucking some of Luna's hidden, obscure or under-the-radar tracks&hellip;

</ul>

<p>Keep your ears peeled as I'm sure there'll be more - and if you spot anything missing (and of course there are things missing) feel free to tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/luna_theband">@luna_theband</a> and set them straight!</p>
