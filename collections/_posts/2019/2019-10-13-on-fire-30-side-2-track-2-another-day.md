Unlike [Blue Thunder which has been done by everyone](/2019/10/01/on-fire-30-side-1-track-1-blue-thunder/), Another Day was, for many years, one of the Galaxie 500 songs that never got an outing. In fact I don't think it often got an outing while Galaxie 500 were a going concern.

But, this all changed this year. 

Firstly at a lovely book event in Walthamstow, London in June Damon & Naomi performed a beautiful version of the song:

And then a couple of days later Dean played On Fire in full for the first time - and you can't do that without playing Another Day. He did a couple more On Fire shows over the summer. Here he is performing Another Day in San Francisco in July with Britta on vocals.

_As On Fire approaches it's 30th birthday I thought I'd post a series of posts of randomness about each of the tracks on the album - some from me and some from other fans._
