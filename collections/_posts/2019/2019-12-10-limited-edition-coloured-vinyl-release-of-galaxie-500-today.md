Galaxie 500's debut album Today is the final studio album to get an exclusive Newbury Comics coloured vinyl release after This Is Our Music and On Fire earlier in the year.

The album will be in maroon vinyl (with a black swirl) and is [available to pre-order now](https://www.newburycomics.com/products/galaxie_500-today_exclusive_lp?variant=31552273940585) and should start shipping later this week.

The release will be limited to 400 copies and is available exclusively through Newbury Comics.
