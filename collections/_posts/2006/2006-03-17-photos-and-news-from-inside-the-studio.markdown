Producer [Tony Visconti](https://web.archive.org/web/20060317+/http://www.tonyvisconti.com) has posted a little
piece on his website (and a couple of pictures) about the first week of work
on the new [Dean & Britta](https://web.archive.org/web/20060317+/http://www.deanandbritta.com) album (you'll need to
scroll halfway down the page).

[Dean & Britta's](https://web.archive.org/web/20060317+/http://www.deanandbritta.com) website
