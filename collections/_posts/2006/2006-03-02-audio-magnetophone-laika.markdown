Magnetophone were...

  * Damon Krukowski (guitar/vocals)
  * Naomi Yang (bass/vocals)
  * Jon Williams (guitar)
  * Chris Guttmacher (drums)

And this is what the [out of date Galaxie 500 and related bands
FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20060302+/http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?article_id=130) (snappy title
huh?) has to say about Magnetophone.  
(courtesy of Sean O'Brien)...

> At the time, Chris was also a member of Cul-de-Sac, a band he left about a
year and a half ago He was also the original drummer in Bullet Lavolta. Jon
Williams is probably best remembered as the original guitarist in Volcano
Suns, but is also a very prolific producer and engineer. If memory serves,
Magnetophone played a grand total of about two shows (one of which I saw) here
in Boston. No recordings were released, although some do exist (produced by
Jon Willaims) I hope this helps a little.

Beyond that I know nothing but enjoy this version of Laika, a track that would
later turn up on Damon & Naomi's first album More Sad Hits
