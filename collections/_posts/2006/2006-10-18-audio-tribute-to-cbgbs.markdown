Last weekend Patti Smith played the last ever show at the legendary New York
venue CBGBs - so here's my little tribute...

First up here's Galaxie 500 performing Hearing Voices from a show at CBGBs in
October 1990.

show

Dean Wareham was quoted in a tribute piece about the venue in the New York
Post...  

> The first band I saw at CBGB's was Richard Helland the Voidoids circa 1980,
when I was 16. I was nervous - it was myfirst time in a rock club. I was a
little frightened when I went downstairs to pee.
