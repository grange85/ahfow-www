A New Years Eve show became a Luna tradition and part of that tradition was a
performance of George McCrae's disco anthem "Rock Your Baby". The song was
written by Harry Wayne Casey and Rick Finch of KC and The Sunshine Band, and
was a hit for McCrae in 1974.

This year for the first time in years there will be no traditional Luna New
Year's Eve show, and no traditional rendition of Rock Your Baby so A Head Full
of Wishes is proud to be able to offer you the opportunity to roll-your-own.

You can enjoy Luna's rendition from New Year's Eve 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004
