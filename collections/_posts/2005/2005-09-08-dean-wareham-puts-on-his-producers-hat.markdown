Dean is currently in North Carolina producing an album for Jule Brown which is
Mark Holland of Jennyanykind's side project.

<del>More details at the official and frighteningly ugly Jule Brown</del> and
the thankfully much prettier [Sonicbids EPK
site](https://web.archive.org/web/20050908+/http://www.sonicbids.com/epk/epk.asp?epk_id=12932)

The Jule Brown official site is [now on
MySpace](https://web.archive.org/web/20050908+/http://www.myspace.com/julebrown) (thanks Mark)
