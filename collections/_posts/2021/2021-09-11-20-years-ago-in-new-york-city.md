I'm sure there'll be plenty of people remembering the events of the 11th September 2001 but since my memories are tied in with Luna I thought I'd just post something here.

On the 1st August 2001 (Dean's birthday) Luna, then very much a New York band, played a show on the _Center Stage at The Twin Towers_ - just over a month later the world was changed by the events. All the photos in this post are from that show (most, possibly all, by Pablo Chang - if you spot one of yours, uncredited, do shout).

Back then the Galaxie 500 Mailing List was still a fairly vibrant discussion forum, mostly full of Luna fans, many of whom were from NYC so the events that played out in the city on that day were documented somewhat on the mailing list.

One of the active members of the list, Steve, was known to work in WTC2, and all Luna band members lived in the city. While it didn't need this connection to be affected by the events it did rather bring it home, even to the folk whose home was far away.

Looking through the mailing list archives of that day here are a few of the posts. I hope no one minds me re-posting their words.

An airplane heading directly toward the towers. Then a cloud of smoke, shock through my whole body. An announcement over the intercom that a plane has just crashed into the WTC. All in the juror selection room had already seem what had been announces. Minutes later 15 or so we see another plane heading toward the building. We were in complete disbelief. As Andy stated the world will not be the same again. Air travel will not be the same. Life as we know it has expired. God I hope that Listmember is safe. Thousands of lives are lost. God help us if there is one.

We finally heard from Steve, I won't post all his post because it is very personal and quite a hard read - and is the sort of thing I wouldn't feel happy posting without permission.
