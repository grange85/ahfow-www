Forgive me this indulgence...

I was born about 8 miles away from where I've spent the last 27 years of my life, but on Monday I'll no longer be calling London my home. Hazel and I had always planned to leave at some point but now that _point_ is here it feels very strange. 

I'll never stop being a Londoner, but it's time to start a new adventure somewhere else - and that _somewhere else_ is about 290 miles from where I was born! Newcastle-upon-Tyne is almost as far from London as you can be yet still be in an English city and we're headed a (very) few miles further on from there. 

So, here are some songs about (or just mentioning) leaving, moving or home - just because.

{% ahfowvideo "LafGLcsc0Ok" "Dean & Britta - Homeward Bound" %}

{% ahfowvideo "DFeRj5rWwW8" "Luna - Going Home - live in Santander, 2017" %}

_Home is made for comin' from, for dreams of going to_

{% ahfowvideo "35DtiGYVE3E" "Dean Wareham - Wand'rin' Star" %}

_So ride me to the station and I'll be on my way, there's a greyhound goin' somewhere and I just want to say I'm leavin'_
