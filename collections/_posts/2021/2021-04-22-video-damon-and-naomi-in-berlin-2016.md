Five years ago today, shortly after Damon fell down some stairs in London and was forced to abandon their show at Cafe OTO in London, Damon & Naomi played a lovely show in Berlin.

After first accompanying Fortune they then played a few extra songs, inlcuding finishing the evening with a sublime cover of Galaxie 500's cover of Yoko Ono's Listen The Snow is Falling
