Back in March 2009 Dean & Britta played a low-key (and sparesely attended) show for Worcester College Consortium students at The Grind at Clark University, shortly after Matt sent me a recording of the show (and a pictures of the setlist) - he said...

> The sound is not perfect, as I was front and center and just had the recorder sitting in a bag, but it is certainly listenable.

I'd have to say that actually the sound is much better than "listenable" (especially considering it was "sitting in a bag"); the setlist was a lovely mix of Dean & Britta (and 13 Most Beautiful), Luna and Galaxie 500; and the atmosphere seemed beautifully relaxed. 

And Bewitched has a trumpet ... which always gives me chills!

Enjoy...
