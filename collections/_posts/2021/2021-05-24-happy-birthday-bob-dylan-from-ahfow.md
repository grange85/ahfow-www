So - his Bobness reaches 80 - here's a few times he's touched A Head Full of Wishes over the years...

In 2006 Bob released Modern Times in an eerily familiar sleeve - it used the same Ted Croner photo that Luna had used on the insert of Penthouse and on the sleeve of the Chinatown / 23 Minutes in Brussels single released 11 years previously.

Dean & Britta recorded Bob's I'll Keep It With Mine for the 13 Most Beautiful project - here's Nico's screen test with the Scott Hardkiss remix of the track as released on the DVD...

At the first Terrastock festival in Providence in 1997 Damon & Naomi were joined by Tom Rapp for this wonderful cover of Bob's I Shall Be Released.
