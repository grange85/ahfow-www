So - his Bobness reaches 80 - here's a few times he's touched A Head Full of Wishes over the years.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/pictures/luna-chinatown-dylan-modern-times.jpg" "Luna -- Bob -- Ted Croner" %}

In 2006 Bob released Modern Times in an eerily familiar sleeve - it used the same Ted Croner photo that Luna had used on the insert of Penthouse and on the sleeve of the Chinatown / 23 Minutes in Brussels single released 11 years previously.

Dean & Britta recorded Bob's I'll Keep It With Mine for the 13 Most Beautiful project - here's Nico's screen test with the Scott Hardkiss remix of the track as released on the DVD...

At the first Terrastock festival in Providence in 1997 Damon & Naomi were joined by Tom Rapp for this wonderful cover of Bob's I Shall Be Released.

Around the time she was recording her solo album Britta recorded Bob's Don't Think Twice, It's Alright with Dean, Roger Brogan and Raymond Richards - it eventually turned up on a Great Pop Supplement split single with Dean's cover of Hey Paula on the flip.

... and just because it came up in a search here's Joakim's fantastic Bob Dylan story as recounted in [his review of Luna's London shows from 2015](/2015/08/14/i-once-met-bob-dylan-on-the-streets-of-paris-luna-in-the-uk-part-two-london/) ...

> I once met Bob Dylan on the streets of Paris before one of his shows, it was close to the Bastille, where Avenue Daumesnil meets Rue de Lyon. I said hello to him and thanks and good luck tonight Mr Dylan, he was carrying a white box with both hands, I’d like to think it was a cake for his band mates. He stared back, lifted the white box up and made clear the he couldn’t shake my hand, because he was carrying a cake. Didn’t say a word, but that look. I still today can’t let go of that moment, a good moment, but scary. It’s almost the same with Dean. I wonder if Dean’s ever given his bandmates a cake.
