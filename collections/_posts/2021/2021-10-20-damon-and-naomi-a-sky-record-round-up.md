**Reviews**
- Tyler Wilcox reviews the album [for Aquarium Drunkard](https://aquariumdrunkard.com/2021/08/11/damon-naomi-a-sky-record/)
> This is one of Damon & Naomi’s most purely gorgeous sounding records — and considering the glories of what’s come before, that’s a real accomplishment.

- [Louder Than War](https://louderthanwar.com/damon-naomi-with-kurihara-a-sky-record-album-review/) gives the album 4/5
> There isn’t a dramatic re-invention here, picking up at a similar end point. But there’s renewed clarity and purpose with A Sky Record all the same.

**For listening**  
- Damon & Naomi have a lengthy discussion of A Sky Record, and Sky Records on the [Free Association podcast](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/free-association-with-brian-ca-115324/episodes/damon-and-naomi-99211804)
- They also have a nice chat on the [Aquarium Drunkard podcast](https://aquariumdrunkard.com/2021/10/06/damon-naomi-transmissions/)

**For watching**
You can still watch the lovely film they made at The Peabody Essex Museum premiering the album
