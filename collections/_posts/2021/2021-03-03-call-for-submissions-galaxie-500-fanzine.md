In 2017 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the birth of Galaxie 500 I produced a fanzine (with the help of lots of folk) called Everything's Swirling - it had photos, sketches, poems and reminscences - it was a bit rough and ready (but ... fanzine) but I was proud of it.

On April 4th 1991 Galaxie 500 played their last show which means next month is the 30th anniversary of the end of Galaxie 500 and that seemed like a good time to create a second issue of Everything's Swirling - to bookend a fans-eye view of the band's lifespan.

So that issue 2 isn't overfull of me it would be good to have contributions from other fans so I would like anything that you may feel fits within a 'zine, so ...

 - photos
 - sketches
 - words
 - comics
 - poems
 - etc.

If you have anything please [get in touch asap](/about/)! I'm pretty much open to any suggestion - so [try me](/about/).



Obviously as the anniversary is just a month away this has a pretty quick turnaround so any help appreciated!
