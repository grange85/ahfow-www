Two years ago today Dean Wareham and Cheval Sombre played one of their few shows promoting the fabulous [Dean Wareham vs Cheval Sombre album](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/dean-and-britta/dean-wareham-releases/dean-wareham-vs-cheval-sombre/).

I hadn't seen these two clips and they're lovely - great to see the projections of [the art](https://a-n-d-y.com/portfolio/dean-wareham/).

Sadly Cheval Sombre's decision to sit down and play means we don't see too much of him.

* _I was once sitting in the front row at a Cheval Sombre gig and [didn't see much](https://flic.kr/p/dvtyr4)!_
