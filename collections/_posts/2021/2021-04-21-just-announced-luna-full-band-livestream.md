Just announced a real live Luna show in a real live club - livestreamed into your living room.

> Yep, we are playing a LUNA live stream show in an actual Hollywood club, the first Luna show since February last year!
> _Britta on the Dean & Britta Patreon_

The show will be performed live in Gold Diggers in Los Angeles on 15th May at 6pm PDT (that'll be 9pm in NYC, 2am in the UK and 3am in bits of Europe) and streamed live via the Veeps platform.

Tickets are $15 or $25 a ticket with audio download of the show (plus $3.75 fees) and are [available to buy now](https://luna.veeps.com/stream/events/39805cda-3dc3-4281-8343-54004240c9fc)

The show will open with a video and the live show will start at 6:20pm. 

I'll see you all there.

Luna's previously performed at Gold Diggers for their Fire in Cairo video back in 2017 - you can read [Josh's review of that show over here](/2017/07/17/a-rolling-and-rollicking-dream-luna-gold-diggers/).
