This is hard to write but I didn't feel I could let it pass - 30 years ago today Galaxie 500 played their last show, three days later the band was no more. 

It's hard because three people I love who were once friends aren't friends any more - that's sad. Of course a band splitting up is bad, but a friendship disolving is so much sadder. Maybe I should have just let this pass, after all the stories around the split have been out there a while now and kicking up the dust again won't change anything, but ... this is a Galxie 500 web site and it's hard to let this week pass without thinking back to 30 years ago.

This is just a collection of snippets related to those last few days of Galaxie 500, taken from various publications and interviews - it's not comprehensive and it's here just as a record - without any comment or editorialising. Nothing I say can change the fact that 30 years ago a band and a friendship died. 

**5th April 1991**

> The band played in a building called Moulton Union, in the main lounge. A band called The Wishniaks, from Philadelphia […] opened up. Galaxie 500 played for about an hour and really didn't seem to want to be there beforehand, although they put on a phenomenal and truly hypnotic show.
> 
> Dean drove a Dodge Dart to Maine. Damon & Naomi drove up in a blue Saab 900. Damon had a drum kit that said Galaxie 500 in silver on the bass drum. Naomi wore orange leggings. About forty or fifty people came to the show.

> The Cocteau Twins' tour ended in Boston, with a show at the Boston Uni versity hockey arena. We had one additional show booked for the following night, at Bowdoin College in Maine. April 5, 1991. We were scheduled to go on at nine that night, but the opening band played for an hour and a half while we waited in the green room that the students had set up for us. Being a college band, they didn't know that the opener is supposed to play a short set and then get off the stage. We sat in that green room getting more and more irritated. And that was our final show-an annoying evening at Bowdoin College

> What happened was simply that Dean quit, more or less out of the blue, on the telephone one day. We have not seen him since, nor spoken since that week. In fact, he didn't even place the call! It was just after the weekend we had finished what turned out to be our last tour, which was an opening slot for the Cocteau Twins in the States; we had an upcoming tour to Japan (this was something Naomi and I were very much looking forward to, as you can imagine, as was Kramer, we were going to take him with us), and when I opened the paper on Monday I discovered there was a sale on for tickets to Tokyo that was ending at midnight. So I called Dean to say “let's buy our tickets”, and he said, no, I quit. No explanation, just “there's nothing more to talk about”, and that was it. A lot of years of friendship, not to mention the band, down the drain in a minute flat.
