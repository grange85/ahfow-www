For years now you have been able to subscribe to get email updates from A Head Full of Wishes - this service was provided by Feedburner which has never been updated, and is frankly rubbish, it doesn't look very good and isn't very flexible. So today I have moved the mailing list to a new provider.

If you would like to receive email updates from A Head Full of Wishes you can [subscribe over here](http://eepurl.com/hvmzyH).

All email will have an unsubscribe link, or you can [unsubscribe here](https://fullofwishes.us1.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=735f72b6be9160802952ab14d&id=3e93b63fc8)

I have moved the existing subscriber list over so hopefully no one will be surprised to get this email.

And, since [Monday's break-up post](/2021/04/05/the-end-of-galaxie-500-30-years-on/) was so heartbreaking here's a postcard from happier times lifted from the fab Temperature's Rising oral history book!
