{% ahfowvideo "v8w6VUicZ7w" "Dean & Britta - Massachusetts (We Love The Betsey, June 2020)" %}

Another lovely Dean & Britta sofa perfromance - this, their cover of The Bee Gees Massachusetts was recorded for the (first) We Love The Betsey stream in support of London's fabulous Betsey Trotwood pub/venue.

The whole evening was packed with good stuff (including contributions from Robyn Hitchcock, Darren Hayman and The Clientele) and you can [view the whole thing over here](https://youtu.be/4sHxUi7Day0).


A different performance of Massachusetts turned up on the Quarantine Tapes release last year which, if you didn't manage to get one of the the lovely lathe-cut box sets, you can [buy digitally from Bandcamp for $7](https://deanandbritta.bandcamp.com/album/quarantine-tapes) (or more)!.
