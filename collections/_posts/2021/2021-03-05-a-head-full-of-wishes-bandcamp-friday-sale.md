Happy Bandcamp Friday! For today's celebration I've reduced prices of the two Galaxie 500 tribute albums I released in 2019 and 2020!

## On Fire 30

All the deluxe editions of On Fire 30 are now sold out but the CD only edition can be had for just £2 (plus postage) - the album was released on the 30th anniversary of Galaxie 500's masterpeice second album _On Fire_ and contains a track-by-track tribute (inlcuding the Blue Thunder EP). 

14 tracks by a range of great artists from around the world including the wonderful Britta Phillips covering Leave The Planet, legendary Robert Scott of The Bats playing _Tell Me_, fab Frnech pop band Vacance's first ever release with a cover of _Strange_ and much more - **and all for just £2**!

The follow up to On Fire 30 was a track-for-track remake of Galaxie 500's final album This Is Our Music - there are **just 12 copies left** of this and these are now available for just £5 + postage!

includes badges, stickers, postcards and a booklet of art and words. Another great album with splendid covers from around the world - Melbourne's Annual Leaf do a brilliant cover of Spook, Miguel M. Matallín from Valencia does a beautiful Way Up High and so much more - **and all for just a fiver**!

_Overseas postage prices have gone a bit crazy in recent years so hopefully the discounts make it worthwhile - but if not both albums are available to buy as digital downloads - only on bandcamp!_
