On the night of the 11th February 1990 Galaxie 500 where supposed to be
supporting indie flavour-of-the-month The Sundays at the Town and Country
club, sadly Sundays singer Harriet had a sore throat and the show was
cancelled. This recording was from the hastily arranged show that Galaxie 500
played just down the road at the Camden Falcon.

Unfortunately I never found out about this until the following weeks NME
reviewed the show. We stood outside the Town & Country scouring a Time Out for
alternative entertainment, could find nothing of interest and drove back to
the Mean Fiddler (driving past the Falcon in the process) and seeing Dylan 
wannabe Andy White.

The Sundays rescheduled for later in the month but sadly Galaxie 500 where no
longer available to provide support.
