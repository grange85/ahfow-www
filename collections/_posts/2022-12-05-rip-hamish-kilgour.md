It's just been confirmed that Hamish Kilgour, who had been missing for a couple of weeks, has been found dead in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Most well known for being in New Zealand band The Clean with his brother David, he later was living in New York City and while there played drums for Dean Wareham on his first post-Galaxie 500 sessions.
