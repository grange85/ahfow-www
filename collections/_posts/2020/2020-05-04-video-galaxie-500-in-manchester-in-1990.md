Fantastic music video channel ScottishTeeVee has just uploaded [video of Galaxie 500's show from Manchester in June 1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnZjs7Zq-rY) to YouTube.

The show was recorded from the audience on a VHS camcorder and has been digitised from a copy of the master tape so looks pretty good for the methode, age and technology.

ScottishTeeVee has previously shared the full version Galaxie 500 MTV Europe appearance (that was abridged and released on the Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste DVD a few years back).

Head over to the YouTube channel, subscribe and wallow in this and the literally hundreds of great videos there!
