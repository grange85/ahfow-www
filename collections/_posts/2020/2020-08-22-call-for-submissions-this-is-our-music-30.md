OK, I've left this a bit late so timescales are a bit short but I think, if I can get enough interest I'd like to do something for the 30th anniversary of This Is Our Music which will be in October. 

I'd like a cover version of each track on the album and, if possible a piece of visual art (preferably square or as close to square as possible).

This will be released as a CD(R) and a booklet.

If you're interested in contributing [please give me a shout](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/about/) and suggest which track you might like to cover (it might help if you have a second choice in case the first has already been assigned). 

Please NOTE the short timescale - I would like all contributions in by the end of September.

If you can contribute [please get in touch](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/about/) - if you know a band or artist who might like to contribute please pass this information on to them.

Track listing

 - Fourth of July
 - Hearing Voices
 - Spook
 - Summertime
 - Way Up High
 - Listen, the Snow Is Falling
