Subject: LUNA play Mallorca  

Due to incredible luck on my part, I actually got to see LUNA play on their
recent exclusive tour of Spain. I arrived in Palma on the day of the concert
and had to wait for 7 gruelling hours at the airport (after having slept less
than 3 hours the night before) before catching a cab to my hotel (due to a bus
strike in Palma the very same weekend), so by the time they finally hit the
stage at Sonotone at 20 past midnight, I was officially bushed beyond
recognition.  
The concert was good as always (my third). I found it sort of strange seeing
them in a completely different place than the 2 previous concerts and a place
I'd never been before, but then I was in a peculiar mood due to aforementioned
bushiness and had reached a point where I found more or less everything
strange. For the same reason, any sort of record of events on my part would
more than likely belie the actual state of the evening.  
However, I did feel a certain obligation as a list member to do my fair share
of trainspotting and jot down a (more or less accurate) set list, so without
further ado, voila:  
Chinatown  
Some new song (That's When It's Over?)  
Dear Diary  
Sideshow by the Seashore  
Double Feature  
Bewitched  
Four Thousand Days  
Pup Tent  
IHOP  
Moon Palace  
23 Minutes in Brussels  
Bonnie and Clyde  
and for the encore:  
California  
Fourth of July  
Pup Tent is probably my least favourite LUNA album, but I have to say the
songs off it work really well live, Pup Tent being probably my favourite
performance of the evening, or perhaps IHOP or Chinatown (my recollection is a
bit vague at this point). I remember thinking when they were playing one of
the Pup Tent songs that Dean's guitar sounded the same way it feels when you
scrape an open wound. Then again, that may be just another testament to my
state of mind that evening. As always, I was blown away by just how much they
rock out live compared to the albums, IHOP and Fourth of July being highlights
in that respect.  
Penthouse continues to feature heavily in the song selection, and I fully
support that, but after 3 concerts I have still to hear them play such a
favourite as 'Friendly Advice' live, not to mention less popular live tracks
like 'This Time Around' or perhaps any of a number of Galaxie 500 songs from
one of the first two albums. Oh well.  
The one new song of the set, which featured Sean on chorus vocals (!), seemed
like they are definitely moving in a more straightforward direction with
definite pop sensibilities and a high level of radio-friendly catchiness. Then
again, that may be a bit much to conclude from one song.  
The mood in the club was very nice, and everybody in LUNA seemed like they
were in a good mood, with Sean contributing heavily to the banter, which was
more lively than at the 2 previous shows I've been to.  
Britta seems like she's been playing with them forever, and although I'll
always miss Justin, she did a very good job on the left side of the stage. AND
it's a nice addition with her vocals on Bonnie and Clyde (and the other
songs).
