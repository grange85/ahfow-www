<p>This one slipped through the net way back in the Fs, so here's a bonus this week. Friday I'm in Love was the second single from The Cure's 1992 album Wish. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_I%27m_in_Love">According to Wikipedia</a> this toe-curling dogs breakfast of a video won "Best Music Video" at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards (I guess that may say more about the 90s than about the video itself? Or maybe more about what I find toe-curling.)</p>

<p>Dean & Britta covered the track for a 2008 tribute album Just Like Heaven.<br />
