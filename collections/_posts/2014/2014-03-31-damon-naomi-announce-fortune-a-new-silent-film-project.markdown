Over on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=747227561976102&set=a.152457488119782.31540.105076796191185&type=1&theater">facebook this afternoon Damon & Naomi announced details of "Fortune"</a> a short silent film directed by Naomi Yang. The film features Norman von Holtzendorff and Anabel Vázquez Rodríguez and will be presented with a live soundtrack of eleven new songs performed by the duo.</p>
<blockquote><p>Synopsis:Norman's father was a society portrait painter. After his father's death, Norman faces the burden of inheriting his father's life's work. He struggles with conflicting feelings about a man who was a gifted artist, but a difficult and unsupportive father. In this emotional journey Norman reconnects with his own artistic nature, something that had not been possible while his father was alive - finally emerging from his father's shadow, and the shadow of his grief.</p></blockquote>
<p>Damon & Naomi are also looking for opportunities to stage the show:</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking like a possible debut for our new silent film with live soundtrack in UK/Euro, mid-May - write us any ideas/offers! Time is short but let's see what we can pull together.</p></blockquote>
