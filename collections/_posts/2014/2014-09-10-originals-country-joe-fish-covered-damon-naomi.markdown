<p>On the Galaxie 500 Mailing List many years ago, while discussing the song, Bob brought up an interesting point...<br />
Bob:</p>
<blockquote><p>this is a very nice version of the Country Joe and the Fish song. However, Damon & Naomi leave off the final and most haunting/troubling verse of the song. Lyrics were definitely a sign of the times...ca 1967 or so....but the Damon & Naomi version omits the punch line. I've thought of asking them why, but always forget whenever I have the chance to see them.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The verse in question...</p>
<blockquote><p>And now my friend we meet again and<br />
We shall see which one will bend<br />
Under the strain of death's golden eyes<br />
Which one of us shall win the prize<br />
To live and which one will die<br />
'Tis I, my friend, yes 'tis I<br />
Shall kill to live again and again<br />
To clutch the throat of sweet revenge<br />
For life is here only for the taking.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:<br />
... so I took advantage of Twitter and asked Damon about that last verse...</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en-gb"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ahfow">@ahfow</a> ...so we chopped it off. and Kramer married it to another cover we&#39;d brought in, making a kind of suite. 1 take, not my best vox alas</p>
