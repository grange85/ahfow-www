White Horses was written by Michael Carr and Ben Nisbett for the UK import of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Horses">Yugoslavian/German TV show</a> Ferien in Lipizza, it was credited to "Jacky", who is actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Lee">Jackie Lee</a>. The theme song was so successful that it was apparently dubbed back onto non-English versions of the show.<br />

<p>Dean & Britta covered the song on their second album, Back Numbers, in 2007.</p>
<p>Later that year Sonic Cathedral Records released a seven inch single with a Sonic Boom remix of the track and a "version Française"<br />
MP3: <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/audio/dean-and-britta-white-horses-version-francaise.mp3">Dean & Britta - White Horses (version Française)</a><br />

<p>The single has sold out but you can get the Sonic Boom remix on <a href="http://soniccathedral.bigcartel.com/product/scr012-cathedral-classics-volume-one">Cathedral Classics Vol 1 for a couple of quid</a> - which is quite the bargain!</p>
<p>Here's a live version recorded for the World Cafe in 2007<br />
MP3: <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/audio/2007-03-08-dean-and-britta-white-horses-wxpn.mp3">Dean & Britta - White Horses (live on WXPN, 8 March 2007)</a><br />

<p>The song has been covered by a hatful of cool folk, most of whom you can find in <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2012/01/19/one-shot-white-horses/">this post on Everything's Swirling</a>.</p>
