<p>Well.... All Right was released by Buddy Holly as the b-side to his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_%28Buddy_Holly_song%29">1958 single Heartbeat</a>. And it does have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis">four dot ellipsis</a>, which I guess technically means that the title has an ellipsis and a full stop as there's really no such thing as a four dot ellipsis (personally I'm disinclined to use a four dots even at the end of a sentence!<br />

<p>The Galaxie 500 cover turned up on a few of Galaxie 500's first demo tapes, <a href="/2011/09/23/audio-friday-recycling-galaxie-500-the-extended-demo-tape/" title="Audio: Friday recycling: Galaxie 500 the extended demo tape">I've blogged about that before</a>, so here you just get to listen to it!</p>
