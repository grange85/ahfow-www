<p>Back in 2004 I had the idea of doing a fan tribute album by folks on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List - it was a good plan, sadly it was poorly executed &hellip; over the next eighteen months the grand vision slowly (very, very slowly) fell apart - entirely due to my lack of any clue.</p>
<p>Lots of nice people had sent in recordings and after a shameful delay I finally burnt a bunch of CDRs, threw together a monochrome sleeve and sent copies out to anyone who wanted one. I have no idea how many - I just kept sending them out until folk stopped asking - <a href="https://static.fullofwishes.co.uk/galaxie_list_tribute/">and then I put it all on a website to download</a>.</p>
<p>The album was a lovely mix from enthusiastic bedroom recordings, to full blown studio offerings; from straight covers to "interpretations". There were four Galaxie 500 tracks and nine Luna ones. And I love every single one of them.</p>
<p>At some point uring that eighteen months lead time, Ron Harrity offered to help out - and I shamefully never jumped at the offer - things would have been so much better if I had. Ron had been in a wonderful band called Nord Express, a few years earlier I'd been sent a tape of their stuff and had become a fan.</p>
<p>Ron had chosen to cover Cold Night - and it starts a gorgeous, gentle retelling of the Galaxie 500 song that builds beautifully and finished perfectly.</p>

<strong>What album or artist has most influenced you as a musician?</strong><br>
Although I donâ€™t make music that sounds anything like his stuff, Dean Wareham and Galaxie 500 were a huge influence for me. Despite being sort of quiet and pretty, their records to me always felt kind of urgent to me. I walked past security backstage after a Luna set at the old 9:30 Club to have him sign his first solo 45. Both he and the band were gracious and unfazed at my fanboy stalking.

<p>I've never been too good at keeping up with folk I really should - Ron is currently part of <a href="https://ananderson.bandcamp.com/">An Anderson which you can checkout on here on Bandcamp</a>.</p>

<p>There's some <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3FszAlNT3gGGoReYVabDby">Nord Express on Spotify</a> and they reall are well worth catching up with! I haven't found any on Bandcamp sadly.</p>

<p class="text-muted">Take a close look at the cover of the tribute album and you might spot a good friend of AHFoW making an appearance making with the sound<a href="https://app.box.com/shared/k85sit4cq5/1/8700277/85433155/1">s</a> rather than with the words!</p>
