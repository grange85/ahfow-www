<p class="lead">A couple of Dean Wareham interviews have just been broadcast and well worth listening to.</p>
<p>First up Dean was interviewed on Saturday afternoon's <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/69879">Todd-o-phonic Todd show on WFMU</a> - you can listen to the interview where Dean talks about the upcoming <a href="/database/dean-and-britta/shows/2016/2016-12-15-dean-and-britta-the-gershman-y-philadelphia-pa-usa/">Dean & Britta / 13 Most Beautiful Show in Philadelphia</a> and also touches on the new Luna covers album that has been hinted at over the last few months.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Todd: You're coming out with a new album of covers</p>
<p>Dean: That's the plan. We've been recording in a studio here, bit by bit whenever we're all in the same town and it's kind of an easy way to get back into it.</p>
<p>T: Are there any teasers regarding songs that you would like to share with my millions of listeners today</p>
<p>D: Here's one, talking about the Velvets still, we've actually done this song 'Friends' from the Squeeze album</p>

<p>Next up <a href="http://www.fidelityhigh.com/#/dean-wareham-podcast/">Dean Wareham talks about The Feelies debut album Crazy Rhythms for Fidelity High</a>.</p>
<blockquote>It's really hard to pick just one song fron this. It's an album that's perfect from beginning to end, and by that actually I mean from song one to nine, because there are subsequent CD editions that add other songs. But I think I'll have to go with the title track, which is the final track it's Crazy Rhythms.
