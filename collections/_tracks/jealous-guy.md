track-lyrics: "I was dreaming of the past.\nAnd my heart was beating fast,\nI began to lose control,\nI began to lose control,\n\nI didn't mean to hurt you,\nI'm sorry that I mad you cry,\nI didn't want to hurt you,\nI'm just a jealous guy,\n\nI was feeling insecure,\nYou night not love me any more,\n\nI was shivering inside,\nI was shivering inside,\n\nI was trying to catch your eyes,\nThought that you were trying to hide,\nI was swallowing my pain,\nI was swallowing my pain."
