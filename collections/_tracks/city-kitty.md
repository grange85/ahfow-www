track-lyrics: "In rented tuxedoes \nThe guests will arrive \nSmiling and smoking \nChewing and choking \nWomen int heir favourite shoes \nThinking dark disturbing thoughts \nAll of them together \nMaking trips to the bathroom \nBlackeyed susans \nAnd chilled potatoes \nHigh balls and low \nA pinch and a punch \nInvisible to mirrors \nYou fly around the room \nTell me the password \nBanana cream pie \n\nSo get up off the floor \nAnd play with me some more \nCome down to my side \nAnd tell me green-eyed lies \nWe'll find a magic spell \nTo turn this much to gold \nWell promises don't grow on trees \n\nPlayin' the oujia board \nIn front of the fire \nIt told me to do \nUnspeakable things \nMixed in a cocktail \nOf muddles emotions \nStinky and winky \nDrinky and stinky \n\nThey made me dance \nThey made me sing \nThe boring bibble babble \nThe dreary dibble dabble \nThe bustle and the vanity \nThe hustle and insanity \nClowning and towning \nFrowning and drowning"
