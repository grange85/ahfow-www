track-lyrics: "He went out walking\nalone to find somewhere to hide\nNo, she wasnâ€™t talking much to him lately\nSo I think its kind of strange when he walks into those rooms again.\n\nHe started humming\nA song that they both used to sing\nSoon it was coming close between them\nAnd sheâ€™ll fall down with her warm vacation sound.\n\nTake something from me...to remember of me...\n\nI had something to say once\nI had a feeling but now its gone\nNow thereâ€™s no one to be away from\nNo, thereâ€™s nothing much at all\nNo, now thereâ€™s nothing much at all\nAt all......at all..."
