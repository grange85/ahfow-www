track-lyrics: "I wrote a poem on a dog biscuit\nAnd your dog refused to look at it\nSo I got drunk and looked at the Empire State Building\nIt was no bigger than a nickel\n\nAnd if it don't improve\nThen I have to move\nI never thought that I would end up here\nMaybe I should just change my style\nBut I feel alright when you smile\n\nI stayed at home on the Fourth of July\nAnd I pulled the shades so I didn't have to see the sky\nI decided to have a Bed In\nBut I forgot to invite anybody\n\nAnd when I fell asleep\nThe neighbours had a peep\nI never thought that I would end up here\nMaybe I should just change my style\nBut I feel all right when you smile"
