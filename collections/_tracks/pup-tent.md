track-lyrics: "Sneakin' a kiss \nOn the fire escape \nA little game of pup tent \nWith a blanket and a broom \nMy mind is taking photographs \nOf every little thing \nExhibit number 2 ...\nA piece of white chocolate \n\nAnd if you want me to, \nI'm gonna cry you a river tonight \nAnd if you ask me to,\nI'm gonna crawl right into your dreams \nAnd did you know, \nI feel a chokin' in the back of my throat \n\nI see you walkin'\nWalkin' on tippytoes \nSwayin' like a sunflower \nOn a Spanish afternoon \nMy mind is taking photographs \nOf every little thing \nExhibit number 8 ...\ndon't be late \n\nYou crept in \nUnderneath the radar \nLiving in a glass house \nSleeping on a glass bed \nBut my mind has taken photographs \nOf every little thing \nHoney turn around \nAnd the shame remains"
