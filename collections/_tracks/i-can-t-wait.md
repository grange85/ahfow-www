track-lyrics: "Maybe I was bad as the ones I hate\nMaybe I was dumb, but I can't wait\nMaybe what you said is not so cool\nMaybe what you did is just too cruel\n\nI can't tell what it takes\nI can't wait for today\n\nScary lookin guys walk down my street\nScary lookin suits I don't wanna meet\nMaybe I was bad as the ones I hate\nMaybe I was dumb, but I can't wait\n\nI can't tell what it takes\nI can't wait for today\n\nI can't tell what it takes\nI can't tell what it takes\nI can't wait for today\nI can't wait for today"
