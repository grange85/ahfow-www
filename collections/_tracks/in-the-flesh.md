    Darlin' darlin' darlin'
    I can't wait to see you
    Your picture ain't enough
    I can't wait to touch you in the flesh

    Darlin' darlin' darlin'
    I can't wait to hear you
    Remembering your love
    Is nothing without you in the flesh

    Went walking one day on the lower East side
    Met you with a girlfriend, you were so divine
    She said, "Hands off this one sweetie, this boy is mine."
    I couldn't resist you - I'm not deaf, dumb, and blind

    Darlin' darlin' darlin'
    Now you're out of town
    Those girls that you run with
    They bring my head down

    Ooh Darlin' darlin'
    Watch out if I see you
    'Cause if you say hello
    It'll mean you wanna see me in the flesh

    Ooh warm and soft, in the flesh
    Ooh close and hot, in the flesh
    Ooh
