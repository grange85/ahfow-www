    The sun is shining on the ground
    I see that nothing makes a sound
    I move, invisible as air
    And choose the time to disappear

    Ah ah ah ah
    I'm in love with you

    The spirits started long ago
    They've found somewhere they couldn't go
    They spend their time just looking out
    For those who never share a doubt

    Ah ah ah ah
    They're in love with you

    The seagull on the seeping sand
    Can die but never understand
    The oil that festers on our shore
    Will cast a stain forevermore

    Ah ah ah ah
    Who's in love with that?

    Gnomes are moving through the night
    They sing and fiddle with delight
    And we eat Weetabix and sing
    About the joys that love can bring

    Ah ah ah ah
    If they ever come
    Ah ah ah ah
    If they ever come

    The sun is shining very hard
    It melts both margarine and lard
    But me I only dream of you
    I hope that you are dreaming too

    Ah ah ah ah
    I'm in love with you
    Ah ah ah ah
    I'm in love with you
    Ah ah ah ah
    I'm in love with you
