track-lyrics: "On Utopia Parkway\nDrank Schaefer in the shade\nWith your mother watching over us\nWe drank beer in the shade\nBut vampires cannot be photographed\nSomebody told me\nDo you have to go to work\nDo you have to go to work\nI am not in possession, of all of the facts\nWell your best friends of the moment\nAre beating you at midnight\nAnd the bad vibe merchant is hanging on the phone\nHe can make a butter rum\nHe can make an ice cube melt\nHe can make your teeth go chatter\nHe can do all this and more\nI am not in possession, of all of the facts\nI am not in possession, of all of the facts\nI am not in possession, of all of the facts\nI am not in possession, of all of the facts\nHmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm"
