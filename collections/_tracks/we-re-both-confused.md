track-lyrics: "Things I did\nHaunt me still\nFollow me around\nLike they know the way\n\nThings she said\nLinger on\nHanging in the air\nAnd they will not go away\n\nI thought I knew her game\nI miss her just the same\n\nThought I knew\nWhat to do\nShe broke my window pane\nBut she said I couldn't prove\n\nI look at my dog\nWe're both confused\nI love September best\nAnd I feel like I should move\n\nI thought I knew her game\nI miss her just the same"
