track-lyrics: |
    off into outer space you go my friends
    we wish you bon voyage
    and when you get there we will welcome you again
    and still you'll wonder at it all
    see all the wonders that you leave behind
    the wonders humble people own
    I know a boy from a tribe so primitive
    he can call me up without no telephone
    see all the wonders that you leave behind
    enshrined in some great hourglass
    the noble tongues, the noble languages
    entombed in some great english class
    off into outer space you go my friends
    we wish you bon voyage
    and when you get there we will welcome you again
    and still you'll wonder at it all

    an anthropologist he wrote a book
    he called it "myths of heaven"
    he's disappeared, his wife is all distraught
    an angel came and got him
    his hair was light, his eyes were love, his words were true,
    his eys were lapis lazuli
    he spoke in a language oh so primitive
    that he made sense to me
    off into outer space you go my friends
    we wish you bon voyage
    and when you get there we will welcome you again
    and still you'll wonder at it all
