track-lyrics: "all of a sudden\nthe girl of my dreams\nshe never asks\nshe always screams\ndo you see her face\nin a puddle at my feet\nas i bend down\nto kiss the street\n\nand i'll come runnin' to her\nand i'll come runnin' to her\n\nher sleep is troubled\nher face will twitch\nshe wakes up angry\nand i'm bewitched\nher smile is forced\nshe's always late\nbut she's not sorry\nand i capitulate\n\nand i'll come runnin' to her\nand i'll come runnin' to her\n\nall of a sudden\nthe girl of my dreams\nshe never asks\nshe always screams"
