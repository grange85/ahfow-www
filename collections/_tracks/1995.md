    Well it's painful to observe
    Looking at your curls
    Sorry to be mean
    But it's sad to be a churl
    Talking to your friends is like talking to a shoe
    His hair is stupid blonde
    And his eyes are stupid blue

    Searching for a crime
    Searching for a crime
    Something slipped my mind
    And I am searching for a crime

    In 1995 I told 1,000 lies
    Let me tell you about the agony of love

    Follow me
    To the top
    All the way
    Never stop
    I know I lost my cool
    It's no where to be found
    My Violent obsession
    Stood the test of time

    Searching for a crime
    Searching for a crime
    Something slipped my mind
    And I am searching for a crime

    In 1995 I told 1,000 lies
    Let me tell you about the agony of love
