track-lyrics: "Will you stand trial\nFor crimes against the mind\nDon't contradict yourself\nNot today\nQuickly fetch the lawyer\nYou haven't long to live\nWords without wrinkles\nWill hurt the most\nGet your story straight\nI heard them say\nQuickly fetch the lawyer\nYou've nothin left to give\n\nGo to the window\nMake love to the wind\nConcentrate and listen\nThis is the end...\n\nA tear filled eye\nRaised to the sky\nYou want us all to notice\nWe got no choice\nListen can you hear me\nYou're going home \nYour dopamine receptors\nAre shot to hell\nYour thoughts are spongy \nYou don't seem well\nListen can you hear me?\nYou're going home"
