track-lyrics: "Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms\nYou should not treat me like a stranger.\nOur Father would not like the way that you act\nAnd you must realize the danger.\nOh, sister, am I not a brother to you\nAnd one deserving of affection?\nAnd is our purpose not the same on this earth,\nTo love and follow his direction?\nWe grew up together\nFrom the cradle to the grave\nWe died and were reborn\nAnd then mysteriously saved.\nOh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,\nDon't turn away, you'll create sorrow.\nTime is an ocean but it ends at the shore\nYou may not see me tomorrow."
