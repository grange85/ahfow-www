track-lyrics: "The little girl, the black fields\nNever had a way to deal with her old man\nNow you need her, you could try it\nYou could burst up through the floorboards\nAnd maybe then....\n \nI got a cold master and she's gonna tell you\nShe's gonna break my back with a bit of\namusement, oh man\nWe're holding hands\n \nSo, if the words get in the way\nHold the silence but just don't stay there\nYou're in the sand\nWhen everything comes crying to you\nWay bye bye, goodbye to holding hands\n \nYou've got to sell it over and I'm gonna buy you\nI got a television with so many lines to bet on\nShe hasn't come home\nBobby, I'm still at home\n \nI've got a cold master and she's gonna tell you\nShe's goona break my back with a bit of\namusement, oh man\nCan we make amends?\nBobby, I'm still at home"
