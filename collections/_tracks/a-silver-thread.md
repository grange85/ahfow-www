track-lyrics: "A silver thread so fine weaves through our shared days\nIs this all we have, this moment so fine\nWill the wind still blow after you have gone?\nIt's so fragile, it breaks before you know\nHow I wish for a way not to lose it all\nHow can I save this moment so fine\nWill the wind still blow after you have gone?"
