track-lyrics: "Why close your eyes to the sky today?\nWhy do you cry today just because the sky is grey?\n\nCause it's ok if every day is not the same day\nIt's just another way that every day is not the same\n\nHow can you see the sky when you close your eyes?\nHow can you run away just because the sky is grey?\n\nCause it's ok if every day is not the same way\nIt's just another way that every day is not the same"
