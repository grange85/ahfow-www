track-lyrics: "Nighttime at the pool bar\nAnd I'm walkinâ€™ home with you\nThe heat is just delicious\nAnd you know just what to do\n\nMorning is so perfect\nBut the noontime makes me tired\nWalking in the park now\nAnd I'm so glad that you were fired\n\nGoing to the movies\nI found a shelter from the sun\nHeard a gruesome story\nAbout a couple on the run"
