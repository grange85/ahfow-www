track-lyrics: "I have always thought\nIn the back of my mind, Cheese and Onions\nI have always thought\nThat the world was unkind, Cheese and Onions\n\nDo I have to spell it out?\nC-H-E-E-S-E-A-N-D-O-N-I-O-N-S-Oh no\n\nMy machine\nKeep yourself clean\nI'll be a has-been\nLike a dinosaur\nMy device\nFor everything nice\nYou better think twice\nAt least once more"
