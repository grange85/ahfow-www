track-lyrics: "I need a walk by the flowers with someone who can share my face\nLooks like nobody could take your place\nAnd I could bleed in sympathy with you\nOn those days\nAnd I could drink up everything you have\nDon't let it go to waste\nI could show you memories\nTo rival Berlin in the Thirties\nI understand your dating bar ways\nAnd I could bleed in sympathy with you\nOn those days\nAnd I could drink up everything you have\nDon't let it go to waste\nSay something warm, say something nice\nI can't to see you when you're cold\nNor can I stand being out of your life\nAnd I could bleed in sympathy with you\nOn those days\nAnd I could drink up everything you have\nDon't let our youth go to waste"
