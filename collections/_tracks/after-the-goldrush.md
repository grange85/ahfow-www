track-lyrics: "Well, I dreamed I saw the knights  \nIn armor coming, \nSaying something about a queen. \nThere were peasants singing and  \nDrummers drumming \nAnd the archer split the tree. \nThere was a fanfare blowing  \nTo the sun \nThat was floating on the breeze. \nLook at Mother Nature on the run  \nIn the nineteen seventies. \nLook at Mother Nature on the run  \nIn the nineteen seventies. \n\nI was lying in a burned out basement \nWith the full moon in my eyes. \nI was hoping for replacement \nWhen the sun burst thru the sky. \nThere was a band playing in my head \nAnd I felt like getting high. \nI was thinking about what a  \nFriend had said  \nI was hoping it was a lie. \nThinking about what a  \nFriend had said  \nI was hoping it was a lie. \n\nWell, I dreamed I saw the silver   \nSpace ships flying \nIn the yellow haze of the sun, \nThere were children crying  \nAnd colors flying \nAll around the chosen ones. \nAll in a dream, all in a dream  \nThe loading had begun. \nThey were flying Mother Nature's  \nSilver seed to a new home in the sun. \nFlying Mother Nature's  \nSilver seed to a new home."
