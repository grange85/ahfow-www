track-lyrics: "Raindrops in Boston\nItâ€™s warm in Toledo\nThereâ€™s blue in my red\n\nWine spoiliody\nGinger is burning a hole in my head\nWhile I was sleeping\nShe came to my room\nAnd borrowed my eyes\nHow Could I know, what I think till I see, what I say?\n\nIâ€™m in a jam\nYouâ€™re in a pickle\nWeâ€™re in a stew\n\nThe airplane is coasting\nThe pilot is sleeping there is nothing to do\nHow will I know?\nWhich way to go\nWho has the answers?\n\nHow could I know, what I think till I see what I say?\n\nIâ€™m in the mood for you\nIâ€™m in the mood for you\n\nIâ€™m in a jam\nYouâ€™re in a pickle\nWeâ€™re in a stew\n\nItâ€™s cold in the autumn,\nItâ€™s warm in the freezer\nThereâ€™s red in my blue\n\nHow will I know?\nWhich way to go\nWho has the answers?\n\nHow could I know, what I think till I see what I say?\n\nIâ€™m in the mood for you\nIâ€™m in the mood for you"
