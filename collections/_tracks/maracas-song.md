track-lyrics: "When I look at you\nWhat a drag to be so mean\nHad a dream\nAll the cops were dead\n\nWhen I went up to Times Square\nBought myself a pair of shoes\nBought myself a pair of shoes\nNow I'm walking sideways too\nNow the heat is in my face\nAnd I have no room to move\nI'm as scared as I can be\nTry and let the daytime pass\n\nWhen I look at you\nWhat a drag to be so mean\nHad a dream\nAll the cops were dead\n\nWhen I went up to Times Square\nBought myself a pair of shoes\nBought myself a pair of shoes\nNow I'm walking sideways too\nNow the heat is in my face\nAnd I have no room to move\nI'm as scared as I can be\nTry and let the daytime pass"
