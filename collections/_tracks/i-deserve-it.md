track-lyrics: "This girl was meant for me\nAnd I was meant for her\nThis girl was dreamt for me\nAnd I was dreamt for her\n\nThis girl has danced for me\nAnd I have danced for her\nThis girl has cried for me\nAnd I have cried for her\n\nMany miles, many roads I have traveled\nFallen down on the way\nMany hearts, many years have unraveled\nLeading up to today\n\nThis girl has prayed for me\nAnd I have prayed for her\nThis girl was made for me\nAnd I was made for her\n\nMany miles, many roads I have traveled\nFallen down on the way\nMany hearts, many years have unraveled\nLeading up to today\n\nI have no regrets\nThere's nothing to forget\nAll the pain was worth it\n\nNot running from the past\nI tried to do what's best\nI know that I deserve it\n\nMany miles, many roads I have traveled\nFallen down on the way\nMany hearts, many years have unraveled\nLeading up to today"
