track-lyrics: "Woman made of paper \nUnderstand me now \nThis time they got you by the ears \nYou might be nothing \nOr just a footprint \nBut they been watching you for years \n\nIt's a strange \nfascination \nIt's a bliss \nIt's a beggar's bliss \n\nA double dance \nFor 20 dollars \nYou may be crooked but not cheap \nGo ahead make a mistake \nThat's what you're made of \nThey been watching you for years \n\nAnd in the shadow of a candlestick \nYou face appears \nQuickly now's the time \nWhy are we waiting?\nUptown, downtown \nI could care less \nI been watching you for years"
