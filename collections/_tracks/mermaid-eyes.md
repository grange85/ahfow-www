track-lyrics: "Do I?\nOh do I?\nRemain in your mind?\n\nOnly to poison\nThe Love that we find\n\nDesires have misplaced\nMy wishes are washes\nThe Air is filled with vibrations\nIâ€™m crying for you\nYouâ€™re crying for me\n>From station to station to station\n\nSilent, soft beauty\nWhere are you now?\nThe tide is turning\nOn your mermaid eyes\n\nDesires have misplaced\nMy wishes are washes\nThe Air is filled with vibrations\nIâ€™m crying for you\nYouâ€™re crying for me\nFrom station to station to station"
