  Call out the instigators
  Because there's something in the air
  We've got to get together sooner or later
  Because the revolution's here, and you know it's right
  And you know that it's right
  We have got to get it together
  We have got to get it together now
  Lock up the streets and houses
  Because there's something in the air
  We've got to get together sooner or later
  Because the revolution's here, and you know it's right
  And you know that it's right
  We have got to get it together
  We have got to get it together now
  Hand out the arms and ammo
  We're going to blast our way through here
  We've got to get together sooner or later
  Because the revolution's here, and you know it's right
  And you know that it's right
  We have got to get it together
  We have got to get it together now
