  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
  Just like the ones I used to know 
  Where the treetops glisten, 
  and children listen 
  To hear sleigh bells in the snow
  
  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
  With every Christmas card I write 
  May your days be merry and bright 
  And may all your Christmases be white 
  
  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
  With every Christmas card I write 
  May your days be merry and bright 
  And may all your Christmases be white
