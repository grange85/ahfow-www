track-lyrics: "I'm late for a date on the way to new haven\nOur clocks run too fast and our heartbeats are haywire\n\nInside those houses people are livinâ€™\nToughened by love that no one will give\n\nI'm on your side\nI'm on your side\nI'm on your side\n\nRattlin' around in my mini cathedral\nSo many problems and our plans are approved\n\nI'm late for a date on the way to new haven\nOur clocks run too fast and our heartbeats are haywire\n\nI'm on your side\nI'm on your side\nI'm on your side"
