track-lyrics: "Your pockets are full \nOf stolen glasses \nBut what's the point?\nYou've had your fill \nYou've had your fill \n\nYou shed your skin \nYou're one of them \nThat somber fool \nEscape while you can \nEscape while you can \n\nYou're coming out of your shell \nYou've got a beautiful view \nYou're gonna shake it off \n\nThis is the place \nThat you were born \nIt's making a comeback \nSince you've been gone \nSince you've been gone \n\nDon't waste your time \nLearning kling-on \nIt ain't no use \nEscape while you can \nEscape while you can"
