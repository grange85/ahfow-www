track-lyrics: "Something in the way you love me won't let me be\nI don't want to be your prisoner so baby won't you set me free\nStop playing with my heart\nFinish what you start\nWhen you make my love come down\nIf you want me let me know\nBaby let it show\nHoney don't you fool around\n\nJust try to understand, I've given all I can,\n'Cause you got the best of me\n\nBorderline feels like I'm going to lose my mind\nYou just keep on pushing my love over the borderline\n\nBorderline feels like I'm going to lose my mind\nYou just keep on pushing my love over the borderline\n\nKeep on pushing me baby\nDon't you know you drive me crazy\nYou just keep on pushing my love over the borderline\n\nSomething in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me\nWhen you hold me in your arms you love me till I just can't see\nBut then you let me down, when I look around, baby you just can't be found\nStop driving me away, I just wanna stay,\nThere's something I just got to say\n\nJust try to understand, I've given all I can,\n'Cause you got the best of me\n\nBorderline feels like I'm going to lose my mind\nYou just keep on pushing my love over the borderline\n\nKeep on pushing me baby\nDon't you know you drive me crazy\nYou just keep on pushing my love over the borderline\n\nLook what your love has done to me\nCome on baby set me free\nYou just keep on pushing my love over the borderline\nYou cause me so much pain, I think I'm going insane\nWhat does it take to make you see?\nYou just keep on pushing my love over the borderline"
