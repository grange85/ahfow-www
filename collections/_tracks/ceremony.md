track-lyrics: "This is why ...\nHeard it all a different story\nAll the time the wheels are turning\nTurn again, turn towards this time\nAll she asks, the strength to hold me\n... the same old story\nLove will travel oh so quickly\nTravel fast, turn towards this time\nI ... them all, no mercy shown\nHeaven knows it's got to be this time\nWhat she heard, these things she said\nTime she cried and failed to wake this time\nI break them down, no mercy shown\nHeaven knows it's got to be this time\nAvenues all lined with trees\nPicture me and then you start watching\nAvenues all lined with trees\nPicture me and then you start watching\nAvenues all lined with trees\nPicture me and then you start watching\nForever\nForever watch ...\nForever\nFor never letting me know"
