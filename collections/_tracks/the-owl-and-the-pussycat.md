track-lyrics: "Alison Andrews came up to see me\nIn a beautiful pea green coat\nShe took my pulse, she brought me pills\nWrapped up in a 5-dollar note\nAnd hand in hand on the edge of the sand\nwe danced by the light of the moon\n \nWe drove away for a year and a day\nTo the land, where the bong tree grows\nThere in the wood a piggy-wig stood\nWith a ring at the end of his nose\nHand in hand on the edge of the sand\nWe danced by the light of the moon"
