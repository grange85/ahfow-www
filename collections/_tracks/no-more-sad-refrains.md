track-lyrics: "Here comes the morning how it pleases\nIt always brings me something new\nIts golden light will wash away the dust of yesterday\nIf I try it may let me forget you\nAnd when these winter days are over\nI mean to set myself upon my feet\nI see me as something that I have never been\nAnd I'll pick up the pieces that will make the girl complete\nI'll be smiling all the time at everybody\nMy friends will tell me I'm just not the same\nI won't linger over any tragedies that were\nAnd I won't be singing any more sad refrains"
