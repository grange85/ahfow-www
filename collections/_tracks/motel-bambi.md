track-lyrics: "Dog day romance, key lime pie\nValium sunset, hazy sky\nMotel bambi\nWhere has all the sunshine gone?\n \nMystic rattlers, 8 eyed spy\nHong kong garden, spanish fly\nMotel Bambi\nWhere has all the sunshine gone?\n \nWe don't belong here\nWe can't compete\nWe don't belong, anymore\n \nI like flowers, I like sex\nCover all the mirrors\nI think I'm gonna cry\nIt's Tuesday morning\nWhere have all the good times gone?\n \nTaxi drivers, yellow hands\nCosmic dancers, on golden sands\nMotel Bambi\nTell me where the good times have gone\n \nWe don't belong\nWe can't complete\nWe don't belong, anymore"
