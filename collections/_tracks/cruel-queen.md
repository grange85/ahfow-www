track-lyrics: "The Queen she divides her land into three\nShe is as cruel as she wants to be\nMany an hour she sits there all alone\nAll alone - but always thinking\nWhich of my children loves me the best?\nIâ€˜ll give them everything, leave none to the rest\nI'll give them all my land and my jewels too\nBut my love - none shall have it\nMother, dear mother, you've done me a great wrong\nYou married me when I was far too young\nThe man was rich, but he left me with a child\nI need your gold to feed him\nDaughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong\nI married you to a great lord's son\nFind a new man for when I'm dead and gone\nAs for gold, I'll give you nothing\nMother, dear mother, if you see fit\nGrant me your kingdom and I'll watch over it\nI will rule your land as you would yourself\nFor I am most like you\nDaughter, dear daughter, no I don't see fit\nTo give you my land, you'll have none of it\nYour words offend me for how could you presume\nThat you could rule as I do?\nWhich of my children loves me the best?\nIâ€˜ll give them everything, leave none to the rest\nI'll give them all my land and my jewels too\nBut my love - none shall have it\nMother, dear mother, I do not want your land\nI don't want your riches, nor jewels on my hand\nMy request is simple, it's every child's desire\nI only want your blessing\nDaughter, dear daughter, you're nothing but a fool\nThis world is governed by one and only rule\nI will die with all my land and all my jewels too\nAnd my love - none shall have it"
