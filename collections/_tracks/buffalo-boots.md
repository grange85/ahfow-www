track-lyrics: "Well she looked real cute\nIn her buffalo boots\nShe has a rosy future\nIn her juicy couture\nLadybug red\nAnd strawberry pink\nMade me stop and wonder\nMade me have to think\n \nThere's a girl in Nolita\nI really wanna snuckle\nAt the supermarket\nI have to bite my knuckle\nMother of pearl\nThrilling my thrill\nMother of girl\nSpilling my spill"
