track-lyrics: "In thirty-three locations high\nIn northern California\nSpace angels show the way\nSpace brothers save the day\nIt's nothin' but an overtone\nFrom a distant land unknown\nUnfavorable omens in the sky\nYou got no time to waste\nThe world is hard to understand\nInside my head it's rainin'\nA million billion trillion stars\nWhat's the use in tryin'?\nA second chance for a second chance\nShe's not the loving kind\nA tearless doll with plastic eyes\nHave you ever seen?\nSeven vodkas to the wind\nSeven ways from sundown\nSeventh heaven seventh veil\nI was only joking\nSeven vodkas to the wind\nSeven steps to Satan\nSeven cities made of gold\nI was only joking"
