track-lyrics: "Hey you,\nOut there in the cold,\nGetting lonely, getting old,\nCan you feel me?\nHey you,\nStanding in the aisle,\nWith itchy feet and fading smile,\nCan you feel me?\nHey you,\nDon't help them to bury the light.\nDon't give in without a fight.\n\nHey you,\nOut there on your own,\nSitting naked by the phone,\nWould you touch me?\nHey you,\nWith your ear against the wall,\nWaiting for someone to call out,\nWould you touch me?\nHey you,\nWould you help me to carry the stone?\nOpen your heart, I'm coming home.\n\nBut it was only fantasy.\nThe wall was too high, as you can see.\nNo matter how he tried he could not break free.\nAnd the worms ate into his brain.\n\nHey you,\nOut there on the road,\nAlways doing what you're told,\nCan you help me?\nHey you,\nOut there beyond the wall,\nBreaking bottles in the hall,\nCan you help me?\nHey you,\nDon't tell me there's no hope at all.\nTogether we stand, divided we fall."
