track-lyrics: "The morning so sweet has a way of disappearing\nThat moment is lost to the day\nThe truth I believed has a way of interfering\nWith what I find I must say\nMy heart is now broken\nAnd I fear we've run out of time\nThe new growth of spring comes alive in such profusion\nI don't even mind when blossoms fall\nYour voice on the phone, it fills me with confusion\nI don't even want you to call\nCause my heart is now broken\nAnd we, we've run out of time"
