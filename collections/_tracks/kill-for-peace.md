track-lyrics: "Kill, kill, kill for peace\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nNear or middle or very far east\nFar or near or very middle east\n\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nIf you don't like the people or the way that they talk\nIf you don't like their manners or they way that they walk,\n\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nIf you don't kill them then the Chinese will\nIf you don't want America to play second fiddle\n\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nIf you let them live they might support the Russians\nIf you let them live they might love the Russians\n\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nKill 'em, kill 'em, strafe those gook creeps!\nThe only gook an American can trust Is a gook that's got\nhis yellow head bust.\n\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nKill, kill, it'll feel so good\nlike my captain said it should\n\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nKill it will give you a mental ease\nkill it will give you a big release\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nKill, kill, kill for peace\n\nKill, kill, kill for peace\nKill, kill, kill for peace"
