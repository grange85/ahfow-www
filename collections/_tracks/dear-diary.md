track-lyrics: "I saw that girl again today\nReading silly magazines\nI saw that girl again today\nSinging songs of bubblegum\nI had my eyes peeled wide\nUp and down the dirty side\nI had my eyes peeled wide\nI think about her all the time\nAnd then you blew my mind\nAlways on my mind\nYou made an educated guess\nYou are an educated girl\nIt was a palace on wheels\nAnd I was just a drunken fool\nI had my eyes peeled wide\nUp and down the dirty side\nI got a head just like a beehive\nI think about her all the time\nWhy must you be\nA mystery to me?"
