track-lyrics: "She's got a smile that it seems to me\nReminds me of childhood memories\nWhere everything\nWas as fresh as the bright blue sky\nNow and then when I see her face\nShe takes me away to that\nspecial place\nAnd if I stared too long\nI'd probably break down and cry\n\nSweet child o' mine\nSweet love of mine\n\nShe's got eyes of the bluest skies\nAs if they thought of rain\nI hate to look into those eyes\nAnd see an ounce of pain\nHer hair reminds me\nof a warm safe place\nWhere as a child I'd hide\nAnd pray for the thunder\nAnd the rain\nTo quietly pass me by\n\nSweet child o' mine\nSweet love of mine\n\nWhere do we go\nWhere do we go now\nWhere do we go\nSweet child o' mine"
