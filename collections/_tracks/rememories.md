track-lyrics: "The Venetian Blinds are slicing up the sun\nAnd the buttons on my head have come undone\nFires made of marble\nAnd you spit me in the eye\nFires made of marble\nAnd you spit me in the eye\n\nItâ€™s been a long, long, long,\nItâ€™s been a long, long, long,\n\nDo you know what it means to make a wish?\nDo you know what it means to make a wish\nBecause I love you\nBut Iâ€™m sending you away\nI love you\nBut Iâ€™m sending you away\n\nItâ€™s been a long, long, long,\nItâ€™s been a long, long, long.\n\nItâ€™s been a long, long, long,\nItâ€™s been a long, long, long."
