track-lyrics: "The world through your eyes looks so elegant\nThat perfect slanting light, the satin gowns\nCould it really be - such a place of harmony?\nAnd the stars glitter off your walls\nAnd your stars never fade at all\nThe moment is caught, saved forever\nThat gaze in the glass, the shadowed room\nCould it really be - or is it trick photography?\nAnd the stars glitter off your walls\nAnd your stars never fade at all\nYour daughters are there, full of tenderness\nThat introspective look you know so well\nCould it really be - such a happy family?\nAnd the stars glitter off your walls\nAnd your stars never fade at all"
