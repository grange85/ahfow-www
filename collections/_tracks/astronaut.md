track-lyrics: "I wanna plug you in\nI wanna get you things\nSend you a pentagram\nFeed you diazepam\nI wanna play the game\nI wanna live again\nI wanna bend your spoons and make your\nSilver shine\n \nI'll wear a Stalin mustache\nYou'll wear a frozen smile\nWe'll run like Tamil Tigers\nWe'll drink the poison vial\nI'm not the Jack of diamonds\nI'm not the six of spades\nI don't know what you thought\nI'm not your astronaut\n \nBecause our surly stare\nIs so revealing\nBecause your feet are bare\nMy eyes are peeling\nBecause your mistletoe\nBecause I gamble\nBecause I told you so\nMy eyes are scrambled"
