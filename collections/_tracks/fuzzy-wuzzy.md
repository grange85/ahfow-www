track-lyrics: "Loose joints loose joints \nSymphonic vaseline \nLoose joints loose joints \nSay exactly what you mean \nDaddy run through the forest \nSee the goblins all around \nDaddy run through the forest \nDaddy doesn't make a sound \n\nSexy long sweater dresses \nChocolate knee high leather boots \nMaybe tonight will be the night \nI could see your fuzzy wuzzy \nSay goodbye to the frogs \nSay goodbye to the lake \nSay goodbye to the chitchat \nEverything's falling into place"
track-guitar: "Intro, Verse, End\nOne guitar plays a B chord\nThe other plays, B, A, B\n\nBreak\nA, B, E\n\n(provided by Drew)"
