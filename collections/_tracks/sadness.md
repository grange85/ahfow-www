  Sadness is in your eye
  Who could have made you cry?
  My lullaby
  Roll along the sleepy dream, deep
  Roll along the sleepy dream, deep

  Salty tear down your cheek
  Drowning the words you speak.
  My lullaby can dry your every care
  Roll along the sleepy dream, deep
  Roll along the sleepy dream, deep

  Sweet dream, my baby lie
  Here in my arms tonight
  Don't cry I'll hold you tight,
  And soothe all your worriy away.

  My lullaby can fly you out of there
  Roll along the sleepy dream, deep
  Roll along the sleepy dream -

  Sweet dream, my baby lie
  Here in my arms tonight
  Don't cry I'll hold you tight,
  And soothe all your worries away.

  Sadness is in your eye
  Who could have made you cry?
  Sadness is in your eye
  Sadness
