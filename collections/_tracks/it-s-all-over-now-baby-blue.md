track-lyrics: "You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last.\nBut whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast.\nYonder stands your orphan with his gun,\nCrying like a fire in the sun.\nLook out the saints are comin' through\nAnd it's all over now, Baby Blue.\n\nThe highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.\nTake what you have gathered from coincidence.\nThe empty-handed painter from your streets\nIs drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.\nThis sky, too, is folding under you\nAnd it's all over now, Baby Blue.\n\nAll your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.\nAll your reindeer armies, are all going home.\nThe lover who just walked out your door\nHas taken all his blankets from the floor.\nThe carpet, too, is moving under you\nAnd it's all over now, Baby Blue.\n\nLeave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.\nForget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.\nThe vagabond who's rapping at your door\nIs standing in the clothes that you once wore.\nStrike another match, go start anew\nAnd it's all over now, Baby Blue."
