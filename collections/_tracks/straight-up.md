track-lyrics: "Lost in a dream\nDon't know which way to go\nIf you are all that you seem\nThen baby I'm moving way too slow\n\nI've been a fool before\nWouldn't like to get my love caught\nIn the slammin' door\nHow about some information--please\n\nStraight up now tell me\nDo you really want to love me forever oh oh oh\nOr am I caught in a hit and run\nStraight up now tell me\nIs it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh\nAre you just having fun\n\nTime's standing still\nWaiting for some small clue\nI keep getting chills\nWhen I think your love is true\n\nI've been a fool before\nWouldn't like to get my love caught\nIn the slammin' door\nHow about some information--please\n\nStraight up now tell me\nDo you really want to love me forever oh oh oh\nOr am I caught in a hit and run\nStraight up now tell me\nIs it gonna be you and me together oh oh oh\nAre you just having fun\n\nYou are so hard to read\nYou play hide and seek\nWith your true intentions\nIf you're only playing games\nI'll just have to say--bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye\n\nDo do you love me\nDo do you love me\nDo do you love me\nDo do you love me\n\nI've been a fool before\nWouldn't like to get my love caught\nIn the slammin' door\nAre you more than hot for me\nOr am I a page in your history-book\nI don't mean to make demands\nBut the word and the deed go hand in hand\nHow about some information--please\n\nChorus cont.\n\nI've been a fool before\nWouldn't like to get my love caught\nIn the slammin' door\nAre you more than hot for me\nOr am I a page in your history-book\nI don't mean to make demands\nBut the word and the deed go hand in hand\nHow about some information--please\n\nChorus out"
