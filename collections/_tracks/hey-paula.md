    Hey, hey Paula, I wanna marry you
    Hey, hey Paula, no one else will ever do
    I've waited so long for school to be through
    Paula, I can't wait no more for you
    My love, my love
    Hey Paul, I've been waiting for you
    Hey, hey, hey Paul, I want to marry you too
    If you love me true, if you love me still
    Our love will always be real
    My love, my love
    True love means planning a life for two
    Being together the whole day through
    True love means waiting and hoping that soon
    Wishes we've made will come true
    My love, my love
