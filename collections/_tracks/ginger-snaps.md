track-lyrics: "When the cowboy sings\nWhen the Saturn rings\nWhen the ginger snaps\nWhen the thunder claps\n\nYou can cut my hair\nYou can fill my cup\nYou can tell me lies\nYou can make it up\nWe're gonna make it after all\n\nI don't need to know who's right or wrong\nIt's not a crime to change your mind\n\nWhen the kitchen sinks\nWhen the sugar winks\nWhen the doctor calls\nWhen Niagara falls\n\nI'm a wayward Tom\nI'm a silver streak\nAnd the walls have ears\nBut the walls don't speak\nWe're gonna make it after all\n\nI don't need to know who's right or wrong\nIt's not a crime to change your mind\n\nDon't need to know\nDon't need to know........"
