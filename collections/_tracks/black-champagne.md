track-lyrics: "Sunday on a Whim\nThings are falling in\nYou made it to your bed\nBut stayed up all night instead\n\nMy eyes are glossed\nMy head is tossed\nIâ€™m writing underneath your gaze\nDonâ€™t you want to know?\nHow this thing will go\nI wonder how things became so strange\n\nThe Battle brings me life\nDrain the disco lights on me\n\nDrinking Black Champagne\nDiamonds in my veins\nMy hands are growing old\nMy Teeth are paved with gold\n\nMy eyes are glossed\nMy head is tossed\nIâ€™m writing underneath your gaze\n\nThe Battle brings me life\nDrain the disco lights on me"
