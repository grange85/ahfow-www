track-lyrics: "Dear Friend,\nYou've lost your center\nAnd cannot find the rhyme\nThat makes you whole\nI can try to tell you\nWhat you already know\nBut it's not for the telling\nIt's what you hold and let go\nIt's when the words come easy\nThey disappear\nWhat's near is all you know\nI can try to tell you\nAbout the ebb and the fl ow\nBut it's not for the telling\nIt's what you hold and let go\nLet it fl oat back to you\nTo your waiting hands\nRed flower\nFloating back"
