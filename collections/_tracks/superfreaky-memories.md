track-lyrics: "Well they're swapping pharmaceuticals in Mussolini Park\nAnd they're wigglin' and wobbilin' and dozin' in the dark\nAnd it's winter in New Jersey and it's Christmas in New York\nWith a giggle and a stare and a bottle and a cork\nAnd Kristina took your photo with a needle and a spoon\nBut she said we got to hurry cos her dad will be home soon\nAnd these superfreaky memories have put me in my place\nBut then my superfreaky memories are gone without a trace\n\nPlease excuse my eyes\nPlease excuse my hands\nPlease excuse my eyes\nPut me in my place\n\nIn a dirty little room in a nasty little world\nYou were out of your mind you were throwin' up your hands\nYou were makin' crazy plans left a message on the mirror\nAnd your mouth was making words but there was nobody there\nNow the gears are rolling by and you don't get any wiser\nAnd the years are rolling on but you're going round and round\nAnd these superfreaky memories have put me in my place\nBut my superfreaky memories are gone without a trace"
