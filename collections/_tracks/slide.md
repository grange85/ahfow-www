track-lyrics: "You can never give\nThe finger to the blind\nSometimes I act so stupid\nBut you never seem to mind\n\nThat's no way to be\nLaughing at the deaf\nI know that I repeat myself\nWhen I got nothing left\n\nBut you know\nHidden thoughts\nPoison life, poison life\nYeah you know\nHidden feelings\nYou steal from yourself\n\nSoho has the boots\nNoho's got the crack\nNew England has the foliage\nBut I'm not goin back\n\nYou tell me that I'm good\nI know that I was bad\nYou made me feel so guilty\nI can't remember what I had\n\nBut you know\nHidden thoughts\nPoison life, poison life\nYeah you know\nHidden feelings\nYou steal from yourself"
