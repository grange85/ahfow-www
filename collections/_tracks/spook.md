track-lyrics: "When you went blind\nThen I nearly lost my mind\nIt didn't last\nCause you have another eyelid\n\nAnd when you smile\nThen you give yourself away\nIt's all too much\nAnd you have another eyelid\n\nBut when you cry\nThen I know we are in trouble\nIt's all too much\nAnd you have another eyelid"
