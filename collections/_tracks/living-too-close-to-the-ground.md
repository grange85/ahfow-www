track-lyrics: "Listen and hear each word\nStop or you'll miss the birds\nThey sing in the top of the trees\nSometimes when you look, you can't see\nBut up there you will know that its round\nYou're living too close to the ground\nCome where the lights are grand\nLeave now without a plan\nYou can get away if you choose\nConfess it, you've nothing to lose\nAnd I can show you where it's found\nYou're living too close to the ground\nRush so you'll pass it by\nDon't let it catch your eye\nDon't stop you might look a fool\nStanding with love in your eyes\nTrying hard to believe what you've found\nYou're living too close to the ground\nI once held her close to me\nListened and heard her breathe\nJust like I have done all my life\nHer heart was the image of mine\nAh, but my wings just couldn't be found\nI was living too close to the ground"
