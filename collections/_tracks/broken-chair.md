track-lyrics: "I thought about it every day\nWhile I was wondering in and out of the pink\nYou had to make another go\nYou were drowning in your wonderful drink\nThere's so much of madness here\nSo much that sinks\nAct like you are, we're all in a terrible fable\nWhat do you see\n \nI'm running so fast\nGotta go where I need\nOut on the road there\nThe devil knows what I see\n \nSometimes you gotta know\nYou gotta make it with a lot of the sane\nHad to be another Joe\nDrifting in and out of the way\nSo much I used to let by\nWas so much like a kick in the head\nBetter be off and I better be able to see what's ahead\n \nIt's beautiful now\nI tell myself I'm braver\nSorry somehow\nNever know what it means to you"
