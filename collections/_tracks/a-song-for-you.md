track-lyrics: |
    Oh my land is like a wild goose
    Wanders all around everywhere
    Trembles and it shakes till every tree is loose
    It rolls the meadows and it rolls the nails
    So take me down to your dance floor
    And I wont mind the people when they stare
    Paint a different color on your front door
    And tomorrow we will still be there

    Jesus built a ship to sing a song to
    It sails the rivers and it sails the tide
    Some of my friends don''t know who they belong to
    Some can''t get a single thing to work inside
    So take me down to your dance floor
    And I wont mind the people when they stare
    Paint a different color on your front door
    And tomorrow we will still be there

    I loved you every day and now I''m leaving
    And I can see the sorrow in your eyes
    I hope you know a lot more than you''re believing
    Just so the sun don''t hurt ou when you cry
    So take me down to your dance floor
    And I wont mind the people when they stare
    Paint a different color on your front door
    And tomorrow we will still be there
    And tomorrow we will still be there
