track-lyrics: |
  Some people run, some people crawl,
  Some people don't even move at all,
  Some roads lead forwards, some roads lead back,
  Some roads are bathed in light, some wrapped in fearful black.

  Time, oh time, where did you go?
  Time, oh good, good time where did you go?

  Some people never get, and some never give,
  Some people never die, and some never live,
  Some folks they treat me mean, some treat me kind,
  Most folks just go there way, don't pay me no mind.

  Time, oh time, where did you go
  Time, oh good, good time where did you go?

  Sometimes I'm satisfied, sometimes I'm not,
  Sometimes my face is cold, sometimes it's hot,
  At sunset I laugh, but at sunrise I cry,
  At midnight I'm in between and wondering why.

  Time, oh time, where did you go
  Time, oh good, good time where did you go?.. 

  Time, oh time, where did you go
  Time, oh good, good time where did you go?..
