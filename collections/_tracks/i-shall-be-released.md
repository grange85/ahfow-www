track-lyrics: "They say ev'rything can be replaced,\nYet ev'ry distance is not near.\nSo I remember ev'ry face\nOf ev'ry man who put me here.\nI see my light come shining\nFrom the west unto the east.\nAny day now, any day now,\nI shall be released.\n\nThey say ev'ry man needs protection,\nThey say ev'ry man must fall.\nYet I swear I see my reflection\nSome place so high above this wall.\nI see my light come shining\nFrom the west unto the east.\nAny day now, any day now,\nI shall be released.\n\nStanding next to me in this lonely crowd,\nIs a man who swears he's not to blame.\nAll day long I hear him shout so loud,\nCrying out that he was framed.\nI see my light come shining\nFrom the west unto the east.\nAny day now, any day now,\nI shall be released."
