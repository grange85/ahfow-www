track-lyrics: "Isn't it a pity\nIsn't it a shame\nHow we break each other's hearts\nAnd cause each other pain?\nHow we take each other's love\nWithout thinking anymore\nForgetting to give back\nIsn't it a pity?\n\nSome things take so long\nAnd how do I explain?\nBut not too many people\nCan see we're all the same\nAnd because of all their tears\nTheir eyes can't hope to see\nThe beauty that surrounds them\nOh isn't it a pity?\n\nIsn't it a pity\nIsn't it a shame\nHow we break each other's hearts\nAnd cause each other pain?\nHow we take each other's love\nWithout thinking anymore\nForgetting to give back\nIsn't it a pity?\n\nForgetting to give back\nIsn't it a pity?\nForgetting to give back\nIsn't it a pity?\n\nWhat a pity"
