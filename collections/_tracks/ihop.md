track-lyrics: "Is there a doctor in the house?\nIn the house of pancakes?\nYou got a banana split \nPersonality \nLately it's been happy house \nAll day long \nSip it slowly and leave the olive \nShe is very fond of you \n\nYou stand accused \nOf smoking english cigarettes \nThat's a provocation \nIf ever one was \nBrother number 1 \nBrother number 2 \nWhy are you fighting?\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\nAnd at the weekly meeting \nOf anonymous cads \nYou shuffle your feet \nAnd whistle out aloud \nListen to what they're saying \nWhat a load of crap \nYou ain't no Cary Grant \nBut then again, who is?"
track-guitar: "Intro (a lot of effects)\nVerse\nD,A,B\nBreak\nF#m, A, Bm\n\n(provided by Drew)"
