track-lyrics: "And the spell it was broken\nAnd I saw with my own eyes\nI never knew that the water could rise so very high\nThere was a time I remember\nThere was a time it was otherwise\nThere was a time that the water didn't rise and rise\nBut the wide open water leads to the sea\nThe wide open water can set you free\nI never learned to turn my boat\nInto the waves to survive\nI let the cruel, cruel water just rise and rise\nWas there a time, can I remember?\nWas there a time when it was otherwise?\nWas there a time that the water didn't rise so very high?\nBut the wide open water leads to the sea\nThe wide open water can set you free"
