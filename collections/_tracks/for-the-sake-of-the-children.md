"For the Sake of the Children" was sung by actor Henry Gibson, formerly of Laugh-In, in the Robert Altman film "Nashville". 

In the film Gibson played diminutive, hypocritical, sequined, hyper-patriotic country music icon Haven Hamilton whose family-values-turned-on-its-head theme song was "For the Sake of the Children (We Must Say Good-Bye)"
