track-lyrics: |
    Came to the door but she wouldn't see me
    So I turned away to leave
    She leaned out the window and said "Where ya goin?"
    Now I have no time to grieve

    And as I pushed my foot to the pedal
    I was driving much too fast
    Rain comin down and I couldn't see much
    Now I have no time to grieve

    Now you're right all the time
    And I'm just oblivious
    I'd rather stay in bed with you
    Till it's time to get a drink"
