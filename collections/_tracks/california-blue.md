  Working all day
  And the sun don't shine
  Trying to get by
  And I'm just killin' time
  I feel the rain
  Fall the whole night through
  Far away from you
  California blue

  California blue
  Dreaming all alone
  Nothing else to do
  California blue
  Everyday I pray
  I'll be on my way
  Saving love for you
  California blue

  One sunny day
  I'll get back again
  Somehow, someway
  But I don't know when
  California blue
  California blue

  Living my life
  With you on my mind
  Thinking of things
  That I left far behind
  It's been so long
  Doing all I can do
  To get back to you
  California blue

  California blue
  Dreaming all alone
  Nothing else to do
  California blue
  Everyday I pray
  I'll be on my way
  Saving love for you
  California blue

  One sunny day
  I'll get back again
  Somehow, someway
  But I don't know when
  California blue
  California blue
  Still missing you
  California blue
  Still missing you
  California blue
  Still missing you
  California blue
