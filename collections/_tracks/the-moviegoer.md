track-lyrics: "in hollywood i hear they have a discoteque for dogs\nand summer camp where you can send your cabbage patch dolls\nif you would point up at the skyline\nothers will look too\nyou could walk on down the street smilin' to yourself\n\nit's hard to get things done\nwith everybody playin' dumb\nit's hard to get along\nto get along with you\n\nmy nextdoor neighbor paints all night\nand sleeps the day away\nhe visits funerals when he can\nand crashes parties too\nmy upstairs neighbor drinks too much\nhe's stinking up the stairwell\nhe cleans his gun\nit's down the hatch\nheres to all of us\n\nit's hard to get things done\nwith everybody playin' dumb\nit's hard to get along\nto get along with you\n\nYou go to movies all day long\nand sitting eating popcorn\nthe pictures splash into your eyes\nand you don't understand\nyour expression never changes\nas if that could protect you\nyour sitting in the darkness now\nwaiting for the end\n\nit's hard to get things done\nwith everybody playin' dumb\nit's hard to get along\nto get along with you"
