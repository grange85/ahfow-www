track-lyrics: "Everybody's talkin' at me.\nI don't hear a word they're sayin',\nOnly the echoes of my mind.\n\nPeople stoppin' starin'\nI can't see the faces,\nOnly the shadows of their eyes.\n\nI'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'\nThru the pourin' rain,\nGoin' where the weather suits my clothes.\n\nBankin' off the northeast wind,\nSailin' on a summer breeze,\nSkippin' over the ocean like a stone.\n\nEverybody's talkin' at me.\nI don't hear a word they're sayin',\nOnly the echoes of my mind.\n\nAnd I won't let you leave my love behind."
