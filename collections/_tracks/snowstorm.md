track-lyrics: "Well I listen to the weatherman\nHe's changed his tone of voice\nAnd he can see it on the radar\nOnly seven hours away\nWell there's gonna be a snowstorm\nWhen the t.v has gone wild\nAnd they got nothin else to think of\nAnd they're letting me go home\n\nWell I'm lookin at the snowflakes\nAnd they all look the same\nAnd the plows are goin by me\nThey're playin some kind of game\nWell you know we had a snowstorm\nAnd the t.v. has gone wild\nAnd they got nothin else to think of\nAnd they're letting me go home"
