track-lyrics: "Man's got his woman to take his seed \nHe's got the power - oh \nShe's got the need \nShe spends her life through pleasing up her man \nShe feeds him dinner or anything she can \n\nShe cries alone at night too often \nHe smokes and drinks and don't come home at all \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \n\nMan makes your hair gray \nHe's your life's mistake \nAll you're really lookin' for is an even break \n\nHe lies right at you \nYou know you hate this game \nHe slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain \n\nShe cries alone at night too often \nHe smokes and drinks and don't come home at all \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \n\nBlack eyes all of the time \nDon't spend a dime \nClean up this grime \nAnd you there down on your knees begging me please come \nWatch me bleed \n\nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed \nOnly women bleed"
