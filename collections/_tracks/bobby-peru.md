track-lyrics: "I told lies to your family \nConcerning your whereabouts \nThey feel so sorry for me \nI invented jealous stories \nMy imagination ran wild \nI made myself so angry \nThe night that you insulted me \nI lay awake thinking \nClever things I could have said \nMy thoughts kept turning to Bobby Peru \nHow would he handle this one \n\n'S' is for sorry for all that I did \nNow is the time to turn it all around \nI know what is the matter so why can't I fix it \nForgive me please \n\nI had lunch with an old girlfriend \nWho knows all my faults \nAnd pretends to want to help \nShe said I really don't mind \nYour keeping secrets from me \nBut please don't keep them from yourself \nMurder is bad, and suicide is sad \nWhy would a girl like that put her head in the oven? \nYou have your theories, and I got one too \nIt's such a waste"
