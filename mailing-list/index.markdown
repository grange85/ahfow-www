<li>No personal abuse - if you need to abuse someone - which you reallyshouldn't! - PLEASE do it in personal email, not on the list.</li>
<li>No binaries/attachments - binaries are huge and of limited interest -ifyou have a picture or sound you'd particularly like to share with the listsend it to me (andy@grange85.co.uk) and I'll make it available on the webpage.</li>
<li>Keep quoting to a minimum - when replying to a post only quote the partsthat are relevant - NOT the whole post.</li>
<li>Keep on-topic - this is really up to your judgement - I'm quite happy totalk of any bands that you may think are suitable to the list - so I'd sayON-TOPIC is anything musical - but give it some thought before you post.</li>
<li>Is it of interest to the WHOLE list - if you are replying to a post andit is only of interest to the person who posted it (such as trades, ridesetc.) please reply in personal email, not on the list.</li>
