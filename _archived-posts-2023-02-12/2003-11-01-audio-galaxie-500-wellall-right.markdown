Time for another real rarity. Well...Alll Right is a cover of the Buddy Holly and The Crickets song that turned up on a few Galaxie 500 demo tapes that the band sent out in 1987. The demo tape officially had just three tracks (Walking Song, The Other Side and On the Floor) however a limited number had a further four tracks tacked onto the end. One of these, Open Road,  was this site's Track of the Month in July 2002. This, while hardly being a long lost Galaxie 500 classic, is an interesting take on a rock standard.
