<p>Galaxie 500's first ever show.</p>

<blockquote>At summer's end we played a gig at my apartment on Front Street. Naomi made up little flyers for the event.It was the best gig of my life. I didn't break a string. I didn't forget the words. We played for 20 minutes, and it was just perfect.

<blockquote>we definitely played &quot;Knockin&#39; on Heaven&#39;s Door&quot; and likely &quot;Walking Song&quot; and &quot;On the Floor&quot; and possibly &quot;Where Have all the Flowers Gone&quot; and &quot;I Can See Clearly Now the Rain is Gone&quot;
