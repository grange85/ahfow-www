<p>Supporting The Pixies.</p><p>This was in the database as a show from December 1987 but having listened to it evidence suggests that its probably from a year later.</p><p>In the show Dean mentions asks if anyone has their album which wasnt released until October 1988, and he also shouts "stick around for The Pixies" at the end.</p>
