<p>The first night of Dean Wareham's two nights at St Pancras Old Church in London at the tail of last year is <a href="http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=478857">currently being seeded on Dimeadozen</a>. You'll need to be registered to get the show, that used to be tricky - not so sure it still is.</p>
<p>The torrent also includes the whole of Jason Papercuts set.</p>
<p>Ray, the recorder/seeder, describes the show in the torrent info...</p>
<blockquote><p>Dean is in fine form - his usual wry and dry demeanour only slipping on two occasions tonight. The first when he begins to read a memorial plaque on the church wall - only to be interrupted by the sudden tolling of the church bells as he announces the long departed honoree's name. The second when a burly man rushes the stage to incongruously insist he announce the moments earlier passing of Nelson Mandela, consequently, it will forever be one of the vagueries of my life that I learned of the death of that venerable gentlemen from the singer of Galaxie 500...</p></blockquote>
