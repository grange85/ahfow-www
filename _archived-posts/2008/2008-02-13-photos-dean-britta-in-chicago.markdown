<p><a href="http://www.kirstiecat.com">Kirstiecat</a> has uploaded a bunch of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kirstiecat/sets/72157603889696937/">very lovely pictures from Dean & Britta's show</a> at the Lakeshore Theatre in Chicago.</p>
<p>It's well worth wading back through her flickr stream as she photographs very beautifully, a lot of very good bands (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kirstiecat/sets/72157600004908011/">she took pictures last time Dean & Britta were in her neck of the woods</a> and also has taken some <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kirstiecat/sets/72157602258594059/">gorgeous pictures of Damon & Naomi</a>)</p>
