<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/48457473736/in/dateposted/" title="Galaxie 500 Peel Sessions bootleg CDR"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48457473736_2a7c72024e_c.jpg" width="799" height="800" alt="Galaxie 500 Peel Sessions bootleg CDR"></a>

The glaring ommission in the otherwise wonderful [Galaxie 500 box set](/2019/08/09/artefacts-012-unopened-galaxie-500-box-set/) was the two sessions the band recorded for the John Peel Show - the first of which was [recorded exactly 30 years ago this week](/database/galaxie-500/shows/1989/1989-09-24-galaxie-500-bbc-radio-one-london-uk/).

To repair this error I took advantage of being employed in the BBC library to acquire myself a copy of the sessions which I designed a sleeve and label for and slipped into my collection as if it were real! I can't remember where I pinched the graphics for it from.

Mine is better than [the official release](/database/galaxie-500/releases/galaxie-500-peel-sessions/) because it is chronologically correct!

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
