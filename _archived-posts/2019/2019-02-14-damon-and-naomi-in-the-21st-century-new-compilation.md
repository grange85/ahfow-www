<p class="lead">Damon & Naomi have just released a new compilation of tracks from their 20|20|20 albums. <a href="https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/in-the-21st-century">Damon & Naomi in the 21st Century</a> is a companion piece to the bands Sub Pop Years released ten years ago.</p>

<p>The album is available for <em>pay what you like</em> at the band's bandcamp page and comes with a pdf of liner notes written by Jenn and Liz Pelly.</p>

<blockquote>Itâ€™s music that makes time stop, or stretch, or slow down. Songs where the ticking clock is not met with pure anxiety

<blockquote>They make me want to see what else the world might have to offer beyond what I know. They make me want to chase ecstatic inspirations as far as they go.
