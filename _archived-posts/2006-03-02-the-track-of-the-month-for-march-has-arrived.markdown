<p>A little bit late but you can now get hold of another rarity for this months featured download.</p>
<p>Magnetophone were a short-lived post-Galaxie 500 band featuring Damon & Naomi - they recorded some demos but nothing was officially released - this months track is "Laika" - a track that would later be re-recorded for the first Damon & Naomi album</p>
