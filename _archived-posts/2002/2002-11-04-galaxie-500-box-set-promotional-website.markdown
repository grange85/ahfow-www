I just found - kicking around on a CD I burned a couple of years back - the web site that Jen Matson put together for Rykodisc to promote the box set back in 1996. It was a lovely web site, packed with stuff, that sadly went astray in a Ryko web reorganisation. The version I found was, sadly, the butchered version that had been doctored for the release of Copenhagen and the re-issue of the individual albums. I've hastily restored it as best I can to the way it (probably) was when it first went up. I have removed all the external links (except one to Jen's web site) and all the RealAudio clips (even though the RealAudio sampler page is still there) and [have popped it on a server](https://static.fullofwishes.co.uk/galaxie500box/).
