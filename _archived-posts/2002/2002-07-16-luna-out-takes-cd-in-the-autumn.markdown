Britta, in a post to the Galaxie 500 mailing list, casually dropped in a reference to a "B-sides CD to be released this fall" which it turns out will be a number of Romantica out-takes (including a cover of the Rolling Stones "Waiting on a Friend) plus Kraftwerk's Neon Lights. It is likely to be an enhanced CD with a couple of videos included. Total = 7 tracks and 2 videos.
