<p>With the premiere of the Luna documentary Tell Me Do You Miss Me only weeks away <em>A Head Full of Wishes</em> took the opportunity of harassing the former members of Luna and director Matthew Buzzell with an email questionnaire. Over the course of the next few weeks, in the run up to the film premiere, I'll post their replies here.</p>
<p>First up <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?article_id=133">Britta Phillips</a> gives her views on the film, the final tour and who should play her in the Hollywood biopic.</p>
<p>New Yorkers should head to the <a href="http://www.tribecafilmfestival.org">Tribeca Film Festival website</a> to buy their tickets to one of the five screenings the film will receive - the rest of us will have to drum our fingers and wait for the <a href="http://www.rhino.com">Rhino</a> DVD release in June.</p>
