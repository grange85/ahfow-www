<li>MuchMusic (Canada) TV interview transcript</li>
</ul>
<p>This was broadcast on Canada's answer to MTV, MuchMusic, and interspersed with short live clips of a Toronto gig.  I'm going by a cassette dub and it's hard to hear what's said sometimes due to traffic passing outside the window (on the tape, not in my house) & tape hiss.  Hopefully I've identified all the speakers correctly.</p>
<hr />
<p>(starts with live bit of "Fourth of July")</p>
<p>Dean:  My voice...  Kinda whiney, I would say.  Untrained.  Ummm...</p>
<p>(laughter from Naomi)</p>
<p>Interviewer:  It's a wild voice.</p>
<p>Dean:  Well, thank you...  I'm pleased you like it.</p>
<p>Interviewer:  You've got a lot of guts.</p>
<p>(much laugher from everyone)</p>
<p>Dean:  Got a lot of guts...  Was that yet another veiled insult?</p>
<p>Damon:  I think it was a compiliment.</p>
<p>Interviewer:  Definitely a compliment</p>
<p>Dean:  There's reviews that say I have a Neil Young fixation, which is rediculous.  I have one of his records, but none of us are like big Neil Young fans.</p>
<p>Interviewer:  Who are you fans of?</p>
<p>Damon:  The old Manchester scene: Joy Division...  (silent)  That was the whole scene...</p>
<p>Dean:  No it wasn't.  Magazine.</p>
<p>Dean/Damon:  Buzzcocks.</p>
<p>Naomi:  Not really all that New Wave stuff.</p>
<p>Damon:  Some of it.</p>
<p>Naomi:  We like the Clash.</p>
<p>(bit of live "Decomposing Trees")</p>
<p>Interviewer:  Is there a lot of pressure then when you go onstage toperform live to...</p>
<p>Dean:  To not be mellow?</p>
<p>Interviewer:  Yeah.</p>
<p>Naomi:  It kind of feels like that just because of "performing" - I mean,it's not as...  I mean, it's not as....  sort of...  as laid back as therecords in the same way.  It's just rawer or something, anyway.... </p>
<p>Damon:  I think there's pressure in the sense that it's usuallyinappropriate in a club.  You don't really feel like being as delicate asyou might on a recording.  And maybe you feel more like being a little bitmore outgoing and pushing it a little louder, cause it's nighttime and everybody's out to have a good time.</p>
<p>Interviewer:  So how do you want people to react to your music.</p>
<p>Dean:  Ummm...  Ecstatically.</p>
<p>(clip of audience applauding)</p>
<p>Naomi:  When we play really quietly, the chatting can be very loud, and it's distracting.</p>
<p>Damon:  It's better when people listen.</p>
<p>Naomi:  Yeah.</p>
<p>Damon:  They usually do.  They usually seem to get drawn in.</p>
<p>Dean:  It's weird, sometimes between songs it's just like silent...</p>
<p>Damon:  Yeah. </p>
<p>Dean:  ...which is a really strange sensation to be in a crowded club andall of a sudden have it be, like, silent.  It's unnerving. </p>
