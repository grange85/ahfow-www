<p>In this occasional series I thought it would be interesting to make available the original versions of songs that have been covered by Galaxie 500, Luna or Damon & Naomi.<br />Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot had a shortlived affair in 1967/8 during which time they recorded the album "Initials B.B." from which this track is taken.<br />After he split from Bardot, Serge started a long-term relationship with British model/actress Jane Birkin, together they recorded the excellent "Je T'aime...". album and the sensational/smutty "Je T'aime Moi Non Plus" single which had been originally written and recorded with Bardot but had been vetoed by the actress because she thought (probably correctly) that it may cause a scandal!<br />Serge died of a heart attack in May 1991</p>
