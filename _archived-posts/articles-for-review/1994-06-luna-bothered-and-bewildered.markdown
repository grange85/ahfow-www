"A lot of what gets labeled as alternative rock now is just '70s hard rock regurgitated," observes Luna leader Dean Wareham. "You've got to get out there and scream about your terrible tortured youth and connect with the kids, but that's not just what we do." 

What Luna does is spin an intoxicating web of sensuously intertwining guitars and whispery lyricism that emphasizes subtlety and implication rather than rockist aggression. Those unfashionable qualities of subtlety, restraint, and quiet confidence are very much in evidence on the band's second album, Bewitched (Elektra), which is even more seductively understated than its 1992 debut Lunapark (a five song EP, Slide, was released between longplayers), thanks to singer/guitarist Wareham's elegantly crafted song's and the band's fluid interplay. Two tracks, "Friendly Advice" and "Great Jones Street," feature guest guitar from Velvet Underground member Sterling Morrison (Luna served as opening act on that band's recent European reunion tour, at the headliners' request, giving more ammunition to short-sighted critics who've tagged Luna as slavish Velvet Underground copyists).

"I generally judge records by small chunks, usually five to 15 seconds long, that get you really excited about a song, and this record has more of those for me," says Wareham. "We make a lot of noise when we play live, but this record turned out pretty quiet, which was mainly just a matter of the songs we recorded that happened to work."

Unlike the mostly studio-constructed Lunapark, the sessions for Bewitched (which the band coproduced with engineer Victor Van Vugt) emphasized organic interplay over sonic precision. "For most of the songs, we set up in a big room and did a lot of takes of everything, just to get the one with the best feel," Wareham says, adding, "Lunapark probably sounds tighter and more accurate than this one does, but I think this one has a much better feel." 

The Australian-born Wareham previously led Boston-based drone-rock trio Galaxie 500, whose three albums led them to the brink of a mainstream breakthrough before Wareham quit amid mounting interpersonal tensions. After relocating to New York, he recruited former Chills bassist Justin Harwood and ex-Feelies drummer Stanley Demeski - both of whom, as it happens, had also just left bands suffering from severe internal problems - as the rhythmic foundation for Luna's melodic flights. 

"I think that most bands become dysfunctional families after a couple of records," opines Wareham. "But everyone in Luna gets along really well, and I think we've all learned a lot from our negative experiences. I certainly appreciate this situation; it's nice to go on the road and have a good time instead of being miserable." 

Bewitched finds Luna a four-piece, with the addition of second guitarist Sean Eden. While the quartet's solid chops contrasts with Galaxie 500's resourceful amateurism, Wareham insists that this shouldn't be interpreted as an indication of a shift in his musical values. "I still think that most musicians suck," he says, "and just because you put four good musicians together doesn't mean they'll come up with anything remotely interesting. The sensibility has to be there." 

The soft-spoken, self-effacing Wareham shows little interest in riding the alternative-rock bandwagon to next-big-thingdom. "All I care about is being able to keep making records," he says. "There's been so much overnight hugeness in the last couple of years, but we don't expect that and we hope nobody else expects it for us. But I think that Luna's pretty accessible; there's nothing on this record that screams, "Play me on the radio," but by the same token I don't see any reason why it couldn't be."
