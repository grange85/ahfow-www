Beachland Ballroom, Cleveland OH

A few observations from the Beachland Ballroom show

* Once the opening band had cleared their equipment from the stage, Lee was setting up sticks of incense in various spots on the stage and around his drum kit.

* First time hearing Malibu Love Nest sung live with lyrics.

* A great Black Postcards extended jam.  It's a shame that the album version ends when it does, the extended jam really makes a great song even better.

* After Broken Chair, an unusual crowd silence prompted Britta to comment "...just like Japan."  This would be the only time she would say anything during the show.

* Overall, the sound was very good.  However, the bass seemed a bit heavy when you would move towards the middle of the room towards the soundboard.

* Microphones set up in front of the soundboard indicating the possibility of a live record?

* Towards the end of the main set, Dean said "a moment of silence for our dead government";.  Keeping in mind that Ohio was very influential in the Presidential election held a week earlier, it sparked a minor debate of sorts among the crowd.

* Friendly Advice, Tugboat and Indian Summer weren't on the setlist.  The three additional songs extended the lone encore into three encores.

* Tugboat seemed to confuse the non-Luna loyal.  Overheard a few people asking each other what song they were playing.

* Initially, the crowd was slow to warm up to the band, but towards the latter part of the night the crowd started to react with much enthusiasm.
