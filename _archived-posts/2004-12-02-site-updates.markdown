Sorry for the site outage at the end of last month - I can't afford another bandwidth bill so I had to shut down. Hopefully the site won't be so popular that I'll have to do it again :/There's a seasonal track of the month to go with the cheesy seasonal top strap...http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/index.php?article_id=116

There's a stack of pictures of Luna's recent show at Irving Plaza...http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/showpic.php?type=1&id=500 

There's a blatant capitalist gesture to try and screw some pennies out of you while you do your Amazon xmas shopping...http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/seasonswishes.php

There's a new(ish) Links section that sorely needs populating, and a few technical tweaks - send me links if you come across any...http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/links1.php

A few new Luna dates, plus setlists and a few other things. No reviews though - so if you want to write something for the site please do!
