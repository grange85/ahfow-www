So into it's eleventh year the survey goes.When it was launched...

  * Penthouse was so new that it only came in a miserable third (it's been top in every survey since 1998)
  * You could only choose from two Damon & Naomi albums
  * Most of us had never heard of Britta Phillips
  * Luna existed

I've had to do a hasty tweak to get the survey working in the new look site so
give me a shout if anything goes screwy! Next year I'll jazz it up - four
years on and this code is looking a little tired...

**Quirks**

You can vote for the new Dean & Britta album because it's in the database -
but don't because you haven't heard it yet!

There are two "Best of Luna" albums to choose from - I'll probably axe
compilations for next time around...

Have fun - and please let me know asap if anything goes wrong!
