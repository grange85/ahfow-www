<p>Apologies for not having a track of the month for a while - I've just been a bit busy with other things and never quite got around to it.<br />As we're half-way through June now I thought I'd make this months track a part of the "Originals" series.<br />This month it's Wire's excellent Outdoor Miner from their "Chairs Missing" album from 1979.<br />Luna's version appeared as a single on the Spanish Radiation label (with the WORST Luna sleeve ever). The song has also been covered by Lush and Flying Saucer Attack amongst others.<br />The Luna cover is one of my favourites and well worth hunting down (or sitting tight fo that rarities compilation!)</p>
