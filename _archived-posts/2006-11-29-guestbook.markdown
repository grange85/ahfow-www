<p>OK this is a shot at bringing the guestbook back - the code is still a bit flaky so some things may go fruity but please be patient <a href="mailto:andy@grange85.co.uk">Email me with any bug reports</a> thanks.</p>
<p>It's using the same code as the commenting so spam should be fairly well managed. The main problems are likely to be comment numbering and paging but we'll see how it goes...</p>
