Luna made a tradition of playing shows on New Year's Eve - and anyone who's
seen in the new year with Luna will be aware that part of that tradition was a
rendition of George McCrae's Rock Your Baby.

Just because there's no Luna and no new year show it doesn't mean you have to
live without that tradition. A Head Full of Wishes gives you the opportunity
to [roll your own Luna new year](/2005/12/05/roll-your-own-luna-new-year/)
with mp3s of Luna's performances.
