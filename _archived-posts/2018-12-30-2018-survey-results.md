<p class="lead">The results of the 2018 A Head Full of Wishes survey are in - thanks to the 100 folk who responded from 19 different countries. I have been in touch with the two whose names were pulled out of the hat - if you haven't heard from me... better luck next time!</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/open/1_bvxDftuBA4kH7b_NO6z4MGqwLPaApJ3">summary results</a> and a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jW6kr5cKBG_LDEGMcbqwolCFVUhFE_UTzHVJSB-eWd0/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet of results from the last few years</a>.</p>

<h2>Galaxie 500</h2>
<p>Once again On Fire topped the album poll getting well over half the total votes cast making its lead more emphatic than ever. In the votes for favourite track and just like last year there was a tie for first place between {% ahfowtrack "Tugboat" %} and {% ahfowtrack "Fourth of July" %}. Perhaps interestingly in light of Damon's analysis of Galaxie 500 streaming trends from this year (<a href="http://internationalsadhits.tumblr.com/post/174500590648/song-streams-by-galaxie-500-on-spotify-may-2018">song streams by Galaxie 500</a>, <a href="http://internationalsadhits.tumblr.com/post/174500590648/song-streams-by-galaxie-500-on-spotify-may-2018">about Galaxie 500 streaming</a>), {% ahfowtrack "Strange" %} has moved above {% ahfowtrack "Blue Thunder" %} into third place (in 2016 Strange wasn't in the top five).</p>

<h2>Luna</h2>
<p>No surprises in the Luna votes as {% ahfowtrack "23 Minutes in Brussels" %} was comfortably ahead of the rest of the pack for favourite track and Penthouse topped the album poll. This year however saw Bewitched giving a strong showing in second place, finishing just three votes shy of Penthouse (last year it was a distant 20 votes off the pace) - maybe were heading for a surprise next year!?</p>

<h2>Damon & Naomi</h2>
<p>More Sad Hits topped the album poll but this year saw a stronger than usual showing in the following pack - with With Ghost getting almost a quarter of the votes, and Wondrous World and Playback Singers showing better than in previous years. {% ahfowtrack "This Car Climbed Mt. Washington" %} topped the track poll, as it always does - with {% ahfowtrack "E.T.A." %} pushing up behind.</p>

<h2>Dean & Britta</h2>
<p>L'Avventura took two thirds of the album votes for favourite Dean & Britta album and {% ahfowtrack "Night Nurse" %} was again a long way ahead of the competition.</p>

<h2>Dean Wareham</h2>
<p>Dean's eponymous album topped the album poll. The new Dean Wareham vs. Cheval Sombre album put in a string showing for an album arriving so late at the starting line. {% ahfowtrack "Holding Pattern" %} came out top in the favourite track poll (which has a different winner every year). {% ahfowtrack "Wayfaring Stranger" %} from the new album found its way into the top 10.</p>

<h2>Summing up</h2>
<p>Thanks again to everyone for contributing - and thanks for so many nice things that were said in the comments box - I don't do it to fish for compliments but it is lovely to get them all the same! This one struck me...</p>
<blockquote>I've been filling this survey out since I was in my 20s. That's surreal.</blockquote>
<p>And just to back up that here's a chart showing how we've aged - from 2003 when 18% of us were over 40 to 2018 when over 80% of us are!</p>
