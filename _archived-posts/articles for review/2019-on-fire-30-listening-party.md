> *22:31*  
> What idiot releases an album on [#buynothingday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/buynothingday)!? [#onfire30](https://twitter.com/hashtag/onfire30) ... and has an [#onfire30](https://twitter.com/hashtag/onfire30) [#listeningparty](https://twitter.com/hashtag/listeningparty) on Thanksgiving - I seriously expect this'll be me talking to myself for an hour!

> Feel free to @ me with any Qs - not that I know much but... hey I can pretend I'm knowledgeable.


> *22:33*  
> Ready? Let's hit play (if you haven't already)! First up is Blue Thunder by Up Periscope. The band formed in Christchurch NZ in 1996 and moved to London in 1998 - they've been operating "under the radar" since!

> *22:48*  
> Watoo Watoo recorded a fabulous Bossa Nova version of @luna_theband's Chinatown for the last tribute CD I did back in 2006 - it was a little less well organised than this one! [#onfire30](https://twitter.com/hashtag/onfire30)

> Rio Arga describe themselves as "a small band in a small heavy rock town" - they're on @bandcamp here [https://rioarga.bandcamp.com/](https://rioarga.bandcamp.com/) and facebook here [https://www.facebook.com/rioargapop/](https://www.facebook.com/rioargapop/)

> *23:13*  
> I was chatting to a pal about this cover and we both thought that this felty more like a cover of George Harrison's original than Galaxie 500's cover - it's beauty, all 8 minutes of it! [#onfire30](https://twitter.com/hashtag/onfire30)


> *23:14*  
> You can find more about Llum on facebook here [https://www.facebook.com/llumonline](https://www.facebook.com/llumonline) [#onfire30](https://twitter.com/hashtag/onfire30)


> *23:20*  
> Wait!? Another Blue Thunder? Yep - my original plan was to release the On Fire LP and the Blue Thunder EP as separate discs but opted in the end to have them as one disc. So, we've just moved onto the EP here!


> *23:21*  
> So, this is Islandia Nunca Quema providing the w/sax version of Blue Thunder - although, no sax. I love this so much, I love how it builds and I love that voice! [#onfire30](https://twitter.com/hashtag/onfire30)


> *23:22*

> *23:36*  
> Cold Night is probably one of Galaxie 500's lost gems and this cover is wonderful and wraps up the CD perfectly [#onfire30](https://twitter.com/hashtag/onfire30)


> *23:39*  
> OK - that's the CD done but I mentioned earlier that Ron Harrity had covered Cold Night for a tribute CD back 2006 - that is also a wonderfulk version of this rarely heard beauty - and as it's so good I've added it as a digital-only bonus. Enjoy!


> *23:40*

> *23:43*  
> Thanks again for supporting A Head Full of Wishes - I always used to say that I did it for me and that other folk liking it was a bonus - but that's possibly a bit of nonsense - the fans make it worth my while! [#onfire30](https://twitter.com/hashtag/onfire30)
