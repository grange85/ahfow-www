  * Luna - Penthouse (Beggars Banquet)
  * by Stephen Dalton
  * NME (UK) August 12 1995

It's a safe bet that Dean Wareham's record collection is huge,meticulously
catalogued and cross referenced to death. His anal fanboyapproach has often
stymied previous Luna outings with AOR staidness,but now, perhaps mindful of
this, he's made his most feisty album yet.The Prozac has worn off, his eyelids
are propped up, and Luna areready to rock. Sort of.

Alas, Dean's still fixated on the classic New York lineage whichhas
underscored almost all his work since Galaxie 500. The original"Sweet Jane"
was a terrific tune and everything, but that'sno justification for knocking
out endless variations on Lou Reed'sthrobbing blueprint like the softly
lapping "Lost in Space"or the slightly breezier "Kalamazoo".

Similiarly, Television axeman Tom Verlaine can drop his trademarkangular
scything into the languid "Moon Palace" or thedriving "23 Minutes in Brussels"
without too much adjustmenton either side. But while jamming with your idols
is undoubtedly ablast, it's sounds rather like cosy mutual backslapping to the
casuallistener.

Fortunately, "Penthouse" is just about quirky and urgentenough to escape the
adequate-but-generic bracket of it'spredecessors, mainly thanks to cool
strummers "Chinatown"and "Double Feature".

By far the best thing Luna have ever done, however, is SergeGainsbourg penned
former single "Bonnie and Clyde", a sultryduet with Stereolab's Laetitia
Sadier. Frustratingly, this is tuckedaway at the end of the CD only, possibly
because it thrasheseverything else here hands for sex, style, atmosphere and
sheer starquality.

So (8) for Dean's record collection, (7) for the CD and (6) forthe album
proper.
