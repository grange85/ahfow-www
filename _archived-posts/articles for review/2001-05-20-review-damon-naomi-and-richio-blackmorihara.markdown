From: Andy Aldridge 

The Clientele opened. I like the Clientele, but I did find them very hard to
like, something about them seemed to require effort. They played a good
opening set and I felt that the effort was rewarded. I'd certainly go and see
them again.  
Next up The Trembling Blue Stars – I must admit that I've kind of lost touch
with TBS recently so the set was a bunch of unfamiliar songs – well unfamiliar
yet unmistakably Bob Wratten. They have a drummer now which gives them the
opportunity to occasionally wig out – very enjoyable (they're headlining the
Garage on 23rd of June – worth a few quid of anyone's money.  
Damon & Naomi were accompanied throughout the set by Michio Kurihara who set
up on a corner of the stage surrounded by a phenomenal array of effects pedals
(a sort of Richio Blackmorihara) but he added a tremendous spice to Damon &
Naomi – and Damon & Naomi seemed to really enjoy having him on sage with them.
The set was, for the most part, taken from "...with Ghost" – Judah, I Dreamed,
The New World,The Great Wall, Tanka – in amongst these was thrown a couple of
oldies Turn of The Century, New York City, Eye Of The Storm, The Navigator – a
couple of covers Tim Buckley's Song To The Siren and a quite beautiful take on
Gram Parsons' A Song For You. Having been tempted back for a second encore we
were then treated to This Car Climbed Mt. Washington.  
All in all a very pleasant evening and worth dragging myself out of my sick
bed for. Shame I can't make it to Wolverhampton tomorrow.
