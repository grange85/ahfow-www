Galaxie 500 is a wintry opiate. A hypnotic open loop of gentle drums, a bass that becalms like mother's fingers to her lips, and a guitar that drifts purposely from languid to leveling. A voice singing high and strange. Sounds like love (lost) in a cold snap.

Singer/guitarist Dean Wareham, bassist Naomi Yang and drummer Damon Krukowski formed Galaxie 500 about two years ago. But they've known each other since high school. Damon laughs when I describe them as "wintry," probably because their new album, _On Fire_, was recorded in the summer. And in conversation, they're neither cold nor cool - though Dean seems guarded, a little suspicious.

What are you afraid of?

Dean: "Bees. Bees and wasps."

Are you allergic to them?

Dean: "No, they're just...." He shrugs in revulsion.

Naomi isn't sure what scares her.

Dean: "I know what you're afraid of. Maggots!"

Naomi (laughing): "Yeah, but that's not a phobia, because they're maggots!"

Dean: "You threw your garbage can out because it had maggots in it."

A few bug stories later, Dean admits he used a wah-wah pedal for On Fire just because they found one at Noise NY, where they make records with producer/noise guru Kramer. Guitar effects aside, Galaxie 500's raw and dreamy groove itself betrays their respect for music older than the latest R.E.M. album.

Damon: "I do have old drums, from the 50s, early 60s. We listen to a lot of old music, more than we would run out and find out what Mudhoney sounds like."

Naomi: "I have an old Gibson bass. It's semi-hollow. Usually basses are blocks of wood. This is a very early bass, so it gives a really warm sound, a very natural sound. The whole body is resonating."

Sterling Morrison on The Velvet Underground '69 is Dean's favorite rhythm guitar on record; Naomi's hands-down favorite bass player is New Order's Peter Hook. And Jonathan Richman, they add, is the most underrated guitar player ever - even if he does sing about ice cream cones. 

"He makes people uncomfortable, they can't handle it," says Dean, like a protective, bitter older brother. Galaxie 500 "covered" a Richman "song" on their first album, _Today_, and their sympathy for the Modern Lover makes sense, if only because Dean's scary falsetto sounds almost adolescent. 

What do you like about Boston?

Damon: "We love the dark and the cold. The cemetaries. No - we're there for school." 

It's cleaner than New York, isn't it?

Dean: "It's not clean. The harbor is filthy, the air is filthy."

Damon: "There are no garbage cans."

Do you like playing in New York more than Boston?

Damon: "If you get a big crowd in Boston, it tends to be a college crowd. If you go see the Pixies now, there's a kind of drunk, college pick-up scene."

Dean: "Yeah, they're just not into the groove. They're not into the love groove like they are here at CBGB. They're like a roomful of maggots!" 

Naomi collapses in sobs and laughter.

Galaxie 500's love groove is peculiar. Their song "Strange" swells up like a lush, isolated journal entry from the other side. The songs sound like AM radio pop at 3 in the morning: lost, beautiful, a very loud quiet. Maybe that's what Dean means when he says their music is "spacy."
