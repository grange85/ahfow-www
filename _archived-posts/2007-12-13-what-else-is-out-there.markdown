<p>There are also a couple of Usenet newsgroups alt.music.luna and alt.music.galaxie-500 but they've been nothing but spam for many years. The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.music.galaxie-500/topics">alt.music.galaxie-500 group</a> is only of interest because Galaxie 500 Mailing List posts were posted there for a couple of years and so it has an archive of the (fairly) early days of the Mailing List.</p>
<p>If anyone is aware of any other sites that should be in this list please <a href="mailto:andy@grange85.co.uk">let me know</a>.</p>
