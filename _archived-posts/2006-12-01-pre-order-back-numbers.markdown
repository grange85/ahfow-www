<p><img src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/sleeves/dab_backnumbers.jpg" alt="Best of Luna sleeve" width="200" height="200" align="right"/>The Zoe Records website is taking pre-orders for the forthcoming Dean & Britta album Back Numbers. The album is not released until 27 February and why anyone would want to order a copy three months in advance is a bit of a mystery...but if you do you can.</p>
<p>The Zoe records site also has short previews of all the tracks on the album and you can hear the complete track (and recent single) Words You Used to Say on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/deanandbritta">Dean & Britta's MySpace page</a></p>
