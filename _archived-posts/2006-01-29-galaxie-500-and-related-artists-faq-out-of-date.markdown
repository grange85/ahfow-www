<p>Seminal is a word often bandied about in describing certaininfluential groups and their works. And sadly, I must use thehackneyed word in an attempt to convey the underrated greatnessthat was Galaxie 500. Like the Velvet Underground before them,Galaxie 500 didn't have a large contemporary audience, but theyhad a profound effect on almost everyone who listened to them.And just as the Velvet Underground are credited as the prodigiousfounders of a new movement in rock and roll, the same can be saidof Galaxie 500.</p>
<p>Like contemporaries such as Hugo Largo and the Cowboy Junkies,Galaxie 500 took a slower approach to constructing and performingtheir music. And with Shimmy-Disc founder and producer Kramer atthe helm of the mixing board, Galaxie 500 managed to achieve aunique sound that both captivated and repulsed critics andreviewers.</p>
<p>Often brought up in reference to a "slow" movement in rock androll today, bands such as Low, Sugar Plant, and Mazzy Star owe anobvious debt to Galaxie 500. Unfortunately, as with manyintensely creative groups, differences between Dean and Damon &Naomi led to their premature disbanding. Dean went on to formLuna, and Damon & Naomi continued on together, under the nameDamon & Naomi.</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, if we're lucky, 20 years from now there willbe a Galaxie 500 reunion concert (if the VU can do it, so canthey, damn it!). Until then we have a legacy of three flawlessalbums to get us through.</p>

<li><a name="I1b">Luna</a>
<ul>
<li>Dean Wareham (guitar/vocals)
<li>Justin Harwood (bass)
<li><em>Britta Phillips (bass) - temporary replacement while Justin takes some leave</em>
<li>Sean Eden (guitar)
<li>Lee Wall (drums)</ul>
<p>After the split Dean Wareham put together Luna, with JustinHarwood (bass), formally of excellent New Zealand popsters TheChills and Stanley Demeski (drums) ex Feelies, with this line upthey released their first album (Lunapark), subsequently the lineup was expanded with the addition of previously unknown guitaristSean Eden to their line up. A deal with major label Elektra sawthem achieve a modicum of success, and clinched them prestigioussupport slots, most notably on the Velvet Underground's reuniontour of 1994. They have also managed to get some equallyprestigious guest stars on their albums, the late SterlingMorrison on Bewitched, and Tom Verlaine on Penthouse.</p>
<p>In summer 1996 Luna replaced Stanley Demeski with Lee Wall. Leewas previously in NYC based band 44, who, as far as I know neverreleased anything commercially. He has apparently recently beenplaying with 44's singer/guitarist Mark in the band Champale.</p>
<p>In January 2000 Justin Harwood took a "leave of absence" from Lunaand returned to NZ "to prepare for the arrival of a baby in his life". He was replaced by Matt Quigley formerly of pop duo Vaganza, whoin turn was hastily replaced by Britta Phillips, formerly of Belltower,and the voice of cartoon rock star Jem of Jem and The Holograms "fame".</p>
<li><a name="I1c">Magnetophone</a>
<ul>
<li>Damon Krukowski (guitar/vocals)
<li>Naomi Yang (bass/vocals)
<li>Jon Williams (guitar)
<li>Chris Guttmacher (drums)</ul>
<p>At the time, Chris was also a member of Cul-de-Sac, a band heleft about a year and a half ago He was also the original drummerin Bullet Lavolta. Jon Williams is probably best remembered asthe original guitarist in Volcano Suns, but is also a veryprolific producer and engineer. If memory serves, Magnetophoneplayed a grand total of about two shows (one of which I saw) herein Boston. No recordings were released, although some do exist(produced by Jon Willaims) I hope this helps a little.</p>

<li><a name="I1d">Pierre Etoile</a>
<p>Before the split of Galaxie 500, Naomi Yang and Damon Krukowskirecorded an EP as Pierre Etoile (it was actually released shortlyafter Galaxie 500's demise). After Galaxie 500 split they wereencouraged by Kramer to opt for the less imaginative Damon andNaomi for subsequent releases.</p>
<li><a name="I1e">Damon & Naomi</a>
<p>Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang, have now released three exceptionalalbums and a number of equally exceptional singles, which they'vefitted around their other careers as artists and publishers.</p>
<li><a name="I1f">Magic Hour</a>
<p>Magic Hour is a project conceived by ex Crystallized Movementsmembers Wayne Rogers and Kate Biggar, who recruited Naomi Yangand Damon Krukowski as their rhythm section, they released threealbums of very long songs, which are of an acquired taste - butin my opinion a taste well worth acquiring. After the release ofthe third album in 1996 it was decided that Magic Hour had runit's course. Damon & Naomi returned to work as Damon & Naomi, andWayne and Kate became the Major Stars. At the Terrastock festivalin April 1997 Magic Hour re-united for a special one-offperformance.</p>
<li><a name="I1g">Kramer</a>
<p>(Mark) Kramer is all things to all men...
<ul>
<li>Record Company Boss
<p>He is the man behind both the Shimmy Disc and Kokopoprecord labels. He was the owner of Noise New York studiowhere Galaxie 500 did most of their recording, and iscurrently the owner of Noise New Jersey.</p>
<li>Record Producer
<p>As well as being the producer of all of Galaxie 500 andDamon & Naomi's records, he has produced an awful lotof the output of Shimmy Disc. Check out Grenadine andLow for starters.</p>
<li>Recording Artist
<p>Kramer has released records as a solo artist; As memberof Shockabilly (with Eugene Chadbourne), Bongwater (withactress Ann Magnusson - Bongwater split in 1994 in a veryacrimonious manner); and in collaboration with a myriad ofother artists including Gong, Hugh Hopper, John Hall,Daevid Allen. He has also toured as a member of theButthole Surfers. His recorded output is very variable,some of it is exquisite some of it is downright irritating,take your chances.</p>
</ul>
<p>Kramer could quite easily warrant a FAQ all of his own(anyone fancy taking on that task?).</p>

<p>Both of these songs were originally written for theexcellent 1975 Robert Altman movie "Nashville", which useda convoluted set of story lines woven around the countrymusic scene in Nashville to satirize American politics,entertainment, and the media culture. The movie was quitefunny, acerbic, and sad. "For the Sake of the Children" wassung by actor Henry Gibson, formerly of Laugh-In. In"Nashville" Gibson played diminutive, hypocritical,sequined, hyper-patriotic country music icon Haven Hamiltonwhose family-values-turned-on-its-head theme song was "Forthe Sake of the Children (We Must Say Good-Bye)"."Memphis" was actually written by actress Karen Black, whoplayed a second-tier singer destined to serve as perpetualstand-in for emotionally fragile superstar Barbara Jean,another icon who is accidentally assassinated at a politicalrally at the movie's end.  "Memphis" was generallyconsidered an egregiously bad song written by an amateurwhose dislike for country music was evident from the song'ssappiness. At the time it was generally thought that Altmanlet it into the film as an indulgence to Karen Black, but itis certainly a strange choice for a cover.  Back in the 70'sthere was a soundtrack album to "Nahville", but it'sprobably long out of print.</p>

<p>According to an interview Damon & Naomi gave in Ptolemaic Terrascope(issue 23) these will "probably surface at some point".</p>
<li><a name="II4">Why did Galaxie 500 split?</a>
<p>The generally considered reasoning behind the split was simply thatDean Wareham decided he didn't want to be in the band anymore.Damon & Naomi gave a very thorough interview in "The PtolemaicTerrascope" magazine (issue 23) where they give their version ofthe events that led to the split. As far as I know Dean hasn't givena full public explanation for his decision.</p>
<li><a name="II5">Why were Luna called Luna2 (or Luna squared)?</a>
<p>I beleive that a US new age singer was using the name Luna and so Lunapark was released as Luna2, after which an agreement/settlement was reached with the artist in question.</p>
<li><a name="II6">Why did Stanley Demeski leave Luna?</a>
<p>Stanley's reluctance to tour was the officially given reason for hisdeparture from the band - these two quotes from interviews given tomusic magazine "Stomp and Stammer" (<a href="http://monsterbit.com/stammer/">http://monsterbit.com/stammer/</a>)give a bit more insight into the separation...</p>
<p>"But I was never really in Luna. I was an employee of the band andI made it clear from the beginning that whenever we went on theroad, I had to be paid. Then, they sort of ran out of money and atthat point, they just kept bugging me to tour with them but I justwasn't that into it to be honest with you."<br />Stanley Demeski - "Stomp & Stammer" - June 1997</p>
<p>"He didn't like touring I guess that was true with everyone in TheFeelies, but I got tired of begging and twisting his arm. And itwas kind of always that way from the beginning, he made that sortof clear, that he would rather stay home."<br />Dean Wareham - "Stomp & Stammer - September 1997</p>
<li><a name="II7">Haven't I heard ... in a TV commercial?</a>
<p>The Luna track "California (All the Way)" has appeared as thesoundtrack to at least two TV commercials - Calvin Klein CK1 (in theUS) and American Express (in the UK).<br />The Galaxie 500 track "Instrumental" from the album "Today" hasrecently (Sept 99) appeared in a US TV commercial for Acura cars.</p>
