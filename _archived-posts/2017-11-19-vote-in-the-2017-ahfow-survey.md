<p class="lead">It's that time of year when you get to vote for your fave albums and songs by all the artists that AHFoW represents - you can either vote below or <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/iJQ0863tY23lfIi62">head over to my Google form</a> to do your voting there. If neither of those appeal you can also vote by <a href="#votebyemail">sending me an email</a>.</p>
