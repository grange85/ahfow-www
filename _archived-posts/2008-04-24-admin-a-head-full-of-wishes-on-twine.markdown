<p>I've just set up a <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.twine.com/twine/a-head-full-of-wishes">"Twine" for "A Head Full of Wishes"</span> (that link will only work if you're signed up so if you're not best keep reading) so if there are any Twine users out there then please come and join.</p>
<p><span class="removed_link" title="http://www.twine.com">Twine</span> is a new community based site that enables you to share and organise information found around the web. I've been tinkering for a while but it seems to be a sort of delicious/stumbleupon thing but, so far at least, much nicer than either of those and it may work better as a sharing community than either of those do (or have done for me). You find something interesting on the web - hit a button, tag it, describe it (if you want) and it gets added to your personal "Twine" (and any other Twines you feel would be interested in the item).</p>
<p>It's currently in beta and is invite only but I do have a few invites to dish out so if you fancy giving it a try please email me off-list.</p>
<p>Where else you can find A Head Full of Wishes...</p>
