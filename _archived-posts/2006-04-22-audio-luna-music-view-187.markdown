<p>Music View was (maybe is??) as far as I can tell a syndicated college radio alternative music show. This interview with Dean Wareham was from around the time of the release of Luna's second album "Bewitched". I was sent this on a CD absolutely ages ago and have been meaning to get it on line ever since but just never got around to it.</p>
<p>The 11' 55" includes a number of short interview sections and the album versions of "This Time Around" and "Going Home" as well as a "Hi this is Dean from Luna..." intro.</p>
