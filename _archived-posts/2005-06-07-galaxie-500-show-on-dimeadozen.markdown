<p>I've just started seeding another Galaxie 500 show on diemadozen. It's from The Kennel Club in San Francisco in 1990. A pretty good audience recording that some kind soul sent me a couple of years back.</p>
<p>Go <a href="http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=45313"> here</a> for details. You will need to register to download the show. Read the <a href="http://www.dimeadozen.org/extras-faq.php">Dime-a-dozen FAQ</a> to find out more about bittorrent</p>
