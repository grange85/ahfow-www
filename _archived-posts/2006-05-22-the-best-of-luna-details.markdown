![Best of Luna sleeve](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/sleeves/luna_best-of.jpg)

Amazon has the tracklisting (and is taking pre-orders) on [The Best of
Luna](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FDFPO8/aheadfullofwi-20) \-
it will be ereleased on the 20th of June (simultaneously with the DVD).

<del>The tracklisting includes a title that I don't recognise which may be to
suck the fans into buying a load of tracks they already have (or a nice bonus
becasue we'd probably buy it anyway).</del>

**update:** It seems the mysterious track is in fact a mistake and instead of "Hard Life" should in fact read "Sideshow by the Seashore.

More details and packaging as soon as I find out anything
