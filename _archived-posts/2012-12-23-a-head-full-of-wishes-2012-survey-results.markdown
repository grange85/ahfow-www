<p>OK, I'll tidy them up nicely and turn out a proper blog post about them in the next day or so but the survey is now finished and the survey results are available for your perusal.</p>
<p><strong>A Head Full of Wishes 2012 survey results</strong></p>
<p>I've also now used various random number generators located out there to pick out the winner of the draw - the winner was Brad and I've already contacted him via the email address he left. If you haven't heard from me then I'm afraid you didn't win. Sorry - I'd love to be able to give you all something!</p>
<p>Anyway thanks to everyone who entered, while 110 responses is down on last year it's still a good number, especially as it's been a rather quiet year (for releases at least).</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Andy</p>
