<p>The 2010 A Head Full of Wishes survey is up and running head over to vote for your favourite Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon & Naomi and Dean & Britta tracks and albums. No incentives this year so you&#39;ll be doing it for the love of the music (and the love of the data) - you can see how last year&#39;s survey went over here.<br></p>
<p><ins datetime="2010-12-23T00:28:20+00:00">voting in the 2010 survey is now closed <a href="/database/survey/2010/">see the results</a></ins></p>
