<p>      anywhichway but true ...........................................    </p>
<p>      1989 , I think it was. Spacemen 3 . The Subterania . London , UK . I don't remember the month      - the sweat oozed from the venue walls as it did all year-round with a half-decent house      inside .<br />      I'm pretty sure we had just done an encore. Not the norm by any means - and as I stepped from      my stool , still gripping the final sustained chord , ready to flee the hurtful lights of the      stage & cameras- a vaguely familiar figure jumped up in front of me and said " HI - Great      Gig Man " , in a wave of Deja Vu one gets when you meet someone 'you feel you know' from the      media .<br />      Normally , such forward an introduction would be met by a 'gaggle' of 'Bouncers' from every      side , but something about the vaguely assured & honest look in his piercing eyes made      him invisible to the usual rebuke.<br />      As I unplugged my guitar he slipped into the dressing room to say Hi to everyone present -      including for some reason Gibby + assorted ButtHoles..............I was kinda stunned . This      sorta thing didn't happen .<br />      Somewhere in the haze of Paul Leary's hash pipe he slipped away , and as it turned out - so      did Spacemen 3.................................    </p>
<p>      15 years go by + sure we keep in contact + cross paths + you know how that goes , but then ,      very generously in '03 Dean gave me the shot to open a few shows for Luna , and I get a      chance to catch up with what's really happening with Him + Luna.<br />      This was the first time I met the equally imposing Britta Phillips , who I could see was a      solid part of the rhythm section - with a nice pocketed melodic touch - just what you need in      a class bass player.    </p>
<p>      Now - memory is a funny thing , 'cos while I can remember when I first heard Galaxie , and      when I first met Dean (and even subsequent shows..the Velvets supports , the shows in venues      with names like Underground & Subterania - yes all with sweating walls......) - but I'll      be fucked if I can remember when I first heard L'Avventura .    </p>
<p>      I guess Dean just sent me a copy .....    </p>
<p>      I know one night , after an amusing + slightly inebriate soiree at the writer Victor Bockris'      house , Dean invited me to swing by + see them recording at Tony Visconti's swish Manhattan      studio the next day . Sure enough , I was grateful of the invite , and duly trouped uptown to      see them working on the bones of "Ginger Snaps".    </p>
<p>      I'll admit it wasn't immediate . Mainly cos of the style of the track + it's skeletal form -      pre-mix............ But , a few weeks later a gloriously pink plastic cd case popped out of      an envelope bearing the full lp in all its glory .<br />      I'm struggling for words to describe my feelings on hearing it - somewhere twixt love +      jealousy .<br />      Between awe + wonder .<br />      Heart Ache + Heart Break...............    </p>
<p>      How could it be . So many great tunes , and such intimacy & emotional parity .Bollocks ,      these guys weren't making my life as a songwriter/musician any easier !!    </p>
<p>      What ? And who wrote these songs ? I knew and expected Dean would come up with good stuff ,      but I hadn't been prepared for Britta's skills to exceed her soulful bass playing into the      realm of masterpiece songwriting .<br />      Dean's songs seemed elevated too - freshly exuberant from his new found soulmates skills      & understanding of him . Languid guitar here , taught emotion there - that midas touch -      and then there's the covers.............well , Dean always had a good ear for a great song ,      but those versions more than ever way exceeded the originals ...................<br />      Jesus . This was some record .<br />      So -I like to do remixes of good work - but I was desperate to do this .<br />      I could hear something different to what Tony Visconti had done , but I just had to persuade      Dean + Britta they needed a bunch of remixes they had no plans for , and no real end use for      either........    </p>
<p>      Well I had a feeling I knew what to do , and , with a few phone calls to old friends I      managed to pull together a studio - along with the generous talents + advice of Nick Kramer      readily at hand as engineer .<br />      The cost of a transatlantic flight , a fun week in the charmed company of Nick , Britta +      Dean in NYC and the remixes were done .    </p>
<p>      Going through the tapes was great . I knew what I thought I could add , and I knew what I      wanted to subtract or highlight , but it was a joy to find those unused guitar takes like the      taught Stacey Sutherland-esque guitar conversation on Knives From Bavaria .<br />      Likewise , I dunno if it was raining -it was April , so there's a high chance.<br />      I love the sound of rain on myriad surfaces , and the melancholy phasing of cars whooshing      thru the water , phasing in and out of distance .<br />      I dunno if it was walking home that night with Nick , with 'Your Baby' rattling round ,      warming our souls or if it just came in one of those Eureka moments , but it was evident the      flow and vibe of the song -while working like a dream with the drone I laid down - had an ebb      that was totally analogous to the random rushes of the storms that sweep in to New York      .<br />      Imagine our glee when the 50's sound fx disc we found fell into place like the song was      written to it. maybe it was ............................Britta's not telling......yet.    </p>
<p>      I don't remember last hearing a song so evocative -and all you're hearing is Dean's caress of      his guitar , Britta's Bass + voice , vibraphones , my drone...............and oh , and those      raindrops and thunder-crashes.........................<br />      I think it was 4 days and nights we worked - I say worked - I sat in an apartment on Houston      , high , and blissed out by the tunes , eating pizza + Subways - and Nick came in every night      and some days to engineer me round his studio and offer his advice and skills.<br />      It says something of his feelings for it too that he took time off work - and then did double      shifts working with me to make it all happen . Double commitment & triple respect for      that . He was as thrilled as I was to be involved . We both were taken back at the quality of      what we were hearing - to me it's what I would point any new band at as something to strive      for - Art made to look easy .<br />      anyway...................    </p>
<p>      All I could hope was that they would like them, or better want to use them.    </p>
<p>      When Dean , Britta + the folks at Jetset heard them , they decided they wanted to release it      .<br />      I was overjoyed .<br />      I got to pick my favourite tracks , remix them AND get them released .<br />      They would even let me do the cover !    </p>
<p>      The cover was another story . I wont bore you with the intricacies of pixel distortion and      format translation , but if you look out - you'll see there's actually 2 versions of the      sleeve -the 2nd is lighter + has a slightly larger Britta + Dean logotype .<br />      Jetset struggled to get it right so you folks get the real deal ,    </p>
<p>      so - that's the way it all happened . It's one of my favourite records ever and one of the      proudest I am to have had a shot at checking thru the looking glass..................<br />      and I guess that's the story I'd tell my grandkiddies - should I ever have any - of the time      Me , Nick , Dean & Britta had a notion to make a disc called "Sonic Souvenirs" -    </p>
<p>      ...................sometimes its the Dark Horses that run with most spirit...........    </p>
