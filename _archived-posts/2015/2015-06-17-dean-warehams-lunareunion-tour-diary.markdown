<blockquote><p>We have sold out two nights at the beautiful Teatro Lara. After the show we go out for drinks with friends from Switzerland, and others who have traveled from Chicago and Los Angeles and Boston, including “City Kitty Nate” — so named because he comes to shows and calls out for "City Kitty."</p>
<p>"Yes," says Sean from the stage, "you have come all the way from Boston, but we are still not going to play that song."</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In Porto we play the spectacular Casa Da Musica, designed by Rem Koolhas. He has thought of everything, except, one stage-hand says, a bathroom backstage. On this sleepy Sunday night we are treated to a home-cooked feijoada, gin and tonic, red wine, 70-year-old port.</p></blockquote>
