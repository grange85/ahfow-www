It's that time of year again - the AHFoW survey has been running annually since 1995 - back then you only had to decide which of three Luna albums was your fave, and your Damon & Naomi choice was between just two! Things are a bit more complicated now ~ so get your thinking caps on!

<p><a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://forms.gle/ZMCvDaHVpLFHZMaG9" role="button">Vote in the 2019 survey</a></p>

There'll be a couple of entries drawn from the e-hat that'll get a little bit of something - one from the US and one from somewhere else in the world.


If the form is a problem feel free to send in your <a href="mailto:survey@fullofwishes.co.uk?Subject=AHFoW%202019%20Survey">vote in an email</a> answering as many or as few of the following questions as takes your fancy:

- Country
- Age (feel free to ignore or be as vague as you like!)
- Fave Galaxie 500 album 
- 3 fave Galaxie 500 songs
- Fave Luna album
- 3 fave Luna songs
- Fave Damon & Naomi album
- 3 fave Damon & Naomi songs
- Fave Dean & Britta album
- 3 fave Dean & Britta songs songs
- Fave Dean album
- 3 fave Dean songs

Also let me know if you want your name to be in the hat for a prize.
