Here's some more information about the imminent screening of Matthew Buzzell's
Luna film in LA

> Tell Me Do You Miss Me, will receive its Los Angeles premiere with a weekend
run on Friday and Saturday June 16th and 17th at The [American Cinematheque's
Egyptian Theatre](https://web.archive.org/web/20060605+/http://www.americancinematheque.com/indexegyptian.html). It
will screen nightly at 7:00 pm and 9:30 pm on both evenings. The American
Cinematheque is located at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard.

>

> Fresh from its world premiere at The 2006 Tribeca Film Festival, Tell Me Do
You Miss Me is a portrait of the four members of the celebrated NYC-based
indie rock band Luna as they confront the ceiling of their ambition, the harsh
realities of their modest success, and their conflicted feelings about each
other as they embark on their final world tour and uncertain futures.

>

> Laced with moments of both humor and melancholia, Tell Me Do You Miss Me is
sonically supported with Luna's dreamy catalog of indie-pop and visually with
lush travelogue footage - with adventurous stops in England, Japan, and Spain.

Gerber, Arabella Field, and Sylvio Sharif Tabet, as well as sound editor Randy
Perry and director Matthew Buzzell will all be in attendance for the
screenings on Friday evening and most likely for Saturday evening as well.
