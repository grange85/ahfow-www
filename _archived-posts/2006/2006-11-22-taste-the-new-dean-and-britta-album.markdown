Frank at (the very wonderful) [Chromewaves](http://www.chromewaves.net/) has a
[post about Dean & Britta](http://www.chromewaves.net/?itemid=2438) and
mentions that you can hear 30 second clips of the whole of the upcoming album
Back Numbers at the Zoe Records website

I haven't listened because I'm not sure I want 30 second tasters but if that's
your cup of tea head on over.

He also mentions that the release date for the album has been pushed back a
month to February 27th.
