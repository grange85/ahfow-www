<p>The 15th A Head Full of Wishes survey has just kicked off. Head over to cast your vote for favourite albums and tracks by Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon & Naomi and Dean & Britta.</p>
<p>I have no incentives to get people to vote this year so you'll all have to do it for the love of the numbers.</p>
<p>If you feel the need for inspiration you can check out the previous surveys.</p>
<p>It would be nice to beat last years 97 responses.</p>
