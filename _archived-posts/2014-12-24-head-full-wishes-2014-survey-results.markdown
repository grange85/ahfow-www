<p>Thanks again to everyone who voted in this year's survey - voting was down to less than half of the <a href="/survey/" title="Survey">previous couple of years</a> - I guess I didn't harass people as much as usual. 62 people voted, on the plus side this does mean that you all had a better chance of being picked out of the hat in the draw - sadly it still means that only one person can get lucky and they've been emailed so if you haven't heard from me your name wasn't pulled out.</p>
<p>Thanks also to all the lovely things said about the web site, it gives me a warm glow. I was going to quote a couple here but it would seem a little vain - rest assured they were all very much appreciated!</p>
<p>Here's a quick summary of how things went you can <a href="/survey/survey-results-2014/" title="Survey results: 2014">see the full results over here</a>.</p>
<h3>Galaxie 500 album</h3>
<p>On Fire was once again the favourite album, although the other two studio LPs are tucked in close behind.<br />

<p>Tugboat overtook Fourth of July to top the favourite track poll.<br />

23 Minutes in Brussels was, as always, the favourite Luna song although it wasn't  as comfortable as usual at the top, with Indian Summer hot on its heels.<br />

<h3>Damon & Naomi</h3>
<p>Damon & Naomi's first album More Sad Hits has always topped the poll but as years progress it becomes clear that folk are digging into the rest of Damon & Naomi's catalogue. With Ghost was in a very healthy second place.<br />

<h3>Dean & Britta</h3>
<p>Dean & Britta's first album L'Avventura once again tops the poll, with only one vote separating the other two albums in the chase.<br />
