<p>A nice <a href="http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=372742">Luna show from 1994 in Milwaukee has shown up on Dimeadozen</a> - the uploader describes it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Supporting their great album, Bewitched, I caught Luna many years back and recently<br />
transferred the tape. I don't see many tapes from this band and this one came out very nice. I hope you enjoy it.</p></blockquote>
<p>You <a href="http://www.dimeadozen.org/account-signup.php">need to register</a> to download from dimeadozen (I've no idea if the registration problems of the past still apply but the advice was always of the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edward_Hickson">if at first you don't succeed...</a>" kind)</p>
