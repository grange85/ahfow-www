### Come and join the new A Head Full of Wishes fan community on Slack

The latest in my ongoing and neverending attempts to get a fan community going outisde of Facebook is now online - I've decided to give the workplace collaboration app Slack a shot so please come and join us there.

Sign up is via invitiation only<sup>*</sup> so please shout in any of the following places if you want to join

 - There's a temporary [invitation link on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/aheadfullofwishes/permalink/10156730719174017/)
 - [email me](andy@fullofwishes.co.uk)
 - [tweet me](https://twitter.com/ahfow)
 - [grab me on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fullofwishes/)
 - find me in anywhere else I might be

Slack is a great tool for collaboration and community allowing discussion channels, private messaging, file and image uploads and could be perfect - what it's currently lacking is you - please come and join us!


<sup>*</sup> _This isn't for any elitist reasons ~ it's the way Slack works - you're all welcome!_
