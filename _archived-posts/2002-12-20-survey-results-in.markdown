<p>The A HEAD FULL OF WISHES/GALAXIE 500 MAILING LIST survey results have just been compiled and are online for your perusal. Not too many surprises - On Fire, Penthouse and More Sad Hits holding onto their crowns. A decent show from the newer albums with both "Romantica" for Luna and "With Ghost" for Damon & Naomi getting a few votes.You can see the results here: <del datetime="2012-12-23T11:32:18+00:00">http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/survey_results.htm</del> <ins datetime="2012-12-23T11:32:18+00:00"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvVnJzEnLB7fdDJLdWlfZkdIc2tfQTFRd1ROeXZ6N2c">survey results 2002</a></ins></p>
