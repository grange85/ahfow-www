<p>Dimeadozen has a Galaxie 500 show for download - it's marked as being the Camden Falcon show from February 1990 but is more likely the Subterrania show from June 1990 - quality is pretty good and the show features Kramer gor the last couple of numbers - worth the download if you have the time/bandwidth.</p>
