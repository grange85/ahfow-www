Damon & Naomi have released the third single from their new album _A Sky Record_ with a video directed by Naomi and fashion designer Gary Graham,

{% ahfowvideo "QKd6XeIQDK0" "Damon & Naomi - The Aftertime (Gary Graham / Naomi Yang)" "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/03-damon_and_naomi/pictures/damon-and-naomi-the-aftertime-video-01.png" %}

The video was [premiered on Brooklyn Vegan](https://www.brooklynvegan.com/damon-naomi-discuss-the-influences-behind-new-album-the-aftertime-video/):

> The video for "The Aftertime" was directed by Naomi and fashion designer and artist Gary Graham. “Gary Graham and I have worked together for almost 15 years," says Naomi. "I wear his clothing every day and on stage and I have collaborated with him on many videos for his brand, GaryGraham422. 'The Aftertime' is a song about the kind of freedom you can give back to yourself, after emerging from a challenging situation — be it a relationship or a year and a half of lockdown…”
> 
> Gary adds, “The original idea was about a squatter who begins overlaying her own imaginary world onto an abandoned building. I love the interior landscapes and the seascape and the castle wallpaper — our castles, the interior/exterior worlds we occupy. Naomi's voice is like an heirloom siren call, the chanteuse as trickster from a faraway place. That place is where Damon & Naomi live, a place that offers a new hypnotic understanding of time, of getting to see how long the sun lasts.”

A Sky Record is [released as a book and digital download on Friday via Bandcamp](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/a-sky-record) (and elswhere later in the month).
