<p>I just came across this video of <a href="http://www.britishseapower.co.uk/">British Sea Power</a> covering Tugboat live in Newcastle back in October. They recorded the track for a <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/release/ba5ca536-00e1-483d-b175-8abcdf9389f8.html">Rough Trade compilation</a> a couple of years back.</p>
