Happy birthday Britta.

So far this year Britta has been Dean's bass player, made a cameo in forthcoming movie of [Jem and the Holograms](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3614530/combined), and is hopefully wrapping up the album that was delayed by the untimely passing of producer Scott Hardkiss

Here's Britta's lovely cover of Spectrum's How You Satisfy Me from Club AC30's Never Lose That Feeling, vol 2

Next up here she is adding vocals to Some Things Last a Long Time from last year's splendid FÃ¼xa album The Electric Sounds of Summer.  


Here's her and Dean in last year's Frances Ha
