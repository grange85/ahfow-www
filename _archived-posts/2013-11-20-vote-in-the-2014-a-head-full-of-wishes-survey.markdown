<div style="font-weight:bold; font-color: #339; font-size: 2em; text-align: center;">Vote in the 2013 survey</div>
<p>It's that time of year again where you get to vote in the 19th A Head Full of Wishes. Vote for your favourite Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon & Naomi and Dean & Britta album and five tracks. One lucky voter will get a couple of 7" singles - probably this one, this one, and the last one of these I'll ever give away!</p>
