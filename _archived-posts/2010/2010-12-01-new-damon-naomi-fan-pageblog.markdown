<p>Still in it's very early days <a href="http://damonandnaomi2011.blogspot.com">The Wondrous World of Damon & Naomi</a> is aiming to provide a place that "people can turn to, for updates about what's going on with the band" </p>
<p>I'll forgive this sentence...</p>
<blockquote><p>I was shocked to discover that there's very little out there in the way of fan-created websites, showing support to this band:)</p></blockquote>
<p>... because this one is an admirable aim...</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to create a an online community where current Damon & Naomi listeners can come together and bask in their love for the band! I would love to have some good Damon & Naomi discussions, about favourite albums, songs, and what their music means to others!</p></blockquote>
