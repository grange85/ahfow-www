Thanks a lot to everyone who voted it was the second biggest turnout ever.

  * Voters from 14 different countries
  * We're all getting older  
in 2006 23% of voters were aged 40 or over as opposed to 11% in 2003 and just
2% (Bob!) in 1995

  * Lunapark topped the Luna poll for the first three surveys  
this year it came 7th (last of the studio albums)

All the usual suspects at the tops of the charts. Galaxie 500's On Fire has
topped all but one poll since 1995; Penthouse has been at the top of the Luna
results since the year after it was released and More Sad Hits is always the
runaway winner for Damon & Naomi. Dean & Britta managed to get votes for their
forthcoming album from a couple of lucky souls who obviously already have
their pre-release copies.
