<p>Thanks a lot to everyone who voted it was the second biggest turnout ever.</p>
<ul>
<li>Voters from 14 different countries</li>
<li>We're all getting older<br/>   in 2006 23% of voters were aged 40 or over   as opposed to 11% in 2003 and just 2% (Bob!) in 1995</li>
<li>Lunapark topped the Luna poll for the first three surveys<br/>   this year it came 7th (last of the studio albums)</li>
</ul>
<p>All the usual suspects at the tops of the charts. Galaxie 500's On Fire has topped all but one poll since 1995; Penthouse has been at the top of the Luna results since the year after it was released and More Sad Hits is always the runaway winner for Damon & Naomi. Dean & Britta managed to get votes for their forthcoming album from a couple of lucky souls who obviously already have their pre-release copies.</p>
