<p>Time for a real rarity. Open Road is a lost Galaxie 500 classic. It's only known appearance was on a few demo tapes that the band sent out in 1987. The demo tape officially had just three tracks (Walking Song, The Other Side and On the Floor) however a limited number had a further four tracks tacked onto the end. This is, in my opinion, the best of those extra tracks.<br />That this track wasn't selected for the box set is a real shame, and can be included, along with the Peel Sessions as justification for another Galaxie 500 rarities disc.</p>
