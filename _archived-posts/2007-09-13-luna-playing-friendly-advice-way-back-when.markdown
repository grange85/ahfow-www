<p>I just came across this video on YouTube of <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkEf5lyEZhc">Luna performing Friendly Advice</span>. I guess it was recorded for a TV show a long time ago...Sean has long hair and Justin and Stanley are in the band. It made me sad and happy simultaneously...There's a great moment about 3'20" in where Dean's soloing and Sean in the background seems to mouth something  with an ecstatic look on his face...</p>
