<p class="lead">Damon Krukowski's book <a href="http://amzn.to/2fwZkmH">The New Analog: Listening and Reconnecting in a Digital World</a> will be published on Record Store Day 2017 and is now available to pre-order from Amazon</p>

<blockquote>Rather than rejecting the digital disruption of cultural life, however, Krukowski wants instead to reexamine what we have lost as a technological culture, looking carefully at what was valuable in the analog realm so we can hold onto it.</blockquote>

<p>The promo blurb name-checks John Berger's amazing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ways_of_Seeing">Ways of Seeing</a> which is a pretty cool name-check and an appetite-whetting comparison.

<blockquote>What John Berger did to ways of seeing, well-known indie musician Damon Krukowski does to ways of listening in this lively guide to the transition from analog to digital culture </blockquote>
