<blockquote>After their triumphant return in 2015, it remained to be seen whether Luna’s reunion was permanent. The band took some time off after their New Year’s show in Californa, but earlier this month Luna played the first of quite a few scheduled 2016 shows [&hellip;] For this particular Dallas show, the setlist contained the familiar songs, but also included a couple of rarities and of course the show featured some clever banter.
