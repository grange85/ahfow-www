<p>It's all over. <a href="/database/survey/2008/">The 2008 survey results are now up</a> for your perusal. The lucky winner of the draw has been notified by email, if you haven't heard anything then sadly you missed out...better luck next year.</p>
<p>A quick summary for those of you who just want headlines...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Galaxie 500 album:</strong> On Fire</li>
<li><strong>Galaxie 500 track:</strong> Tugboat</li>
<li><strong>Luna album:</strong> Penthouse</li>
<li><strong>Luna track:</strong> 23 Minutes in Brussels</li>
<li><strong>Damon & Naomi album:</strong> More Sad Hits
<li>
<li><strong>Damon & Naomi track:</strong> This Car Climbed Mt Washington</li>
<li><strong>Dean & Britta album:</strong> L'Avventura</li>
<li><strong>Dean & Britta track:</strong> Night Nurse</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to everyone who voted and to all the folk who used the comments field to say such nice things about A Head Full of Wishes...I do it for my own sad satisfaction but if I were to need justification for the insane amount of time I waste/spend on it then I know I can find it.</p>
<p>Have a great Christmas if you care, or a great whatever you do care about if you don't</p>
