Back in 1997, in the wake of [the heartbreaking Ptolemaic Terrascope interview](http://www.terrascope.co.uk/MyBackPages/Damon_and_Naomi.htm), I wrote a fan letter to Damon & Naomi. To be honest I can't remember if this was a real letter or an email. In my head it was a real letter with a stamp and everything. But that maybe the romantic in me trying to convince myself that I'd written a proper, old fashioned fan letter.

For the sake of argument let's assume that it was real.

This was, I'm fairly certain, the first fan letter I'd written to anyone. I had previously joined the Motorheadbangers fan club but don't remember ever sending Lemmy a gushing letter.

The response I got was this lovely, and very real, letter from Naomi where she touches on the PT interview, and the first Terrastock festival.

There's more beneath the envelope but... I need some secrets. 

The last line read:

> Congratulations on your new baby

That new baby graduated from university last month.

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
