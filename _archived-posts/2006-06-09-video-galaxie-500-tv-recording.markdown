<p>This performance of Galaxie 500 performing Strange was recorded for a UK television show in 1990 - it features Damon playing acoustic guitar and some early kazoo work from Dean (who later played Kazoo on Luna's cover version of Everybody's Talking).</p>
<p>This and two other tracks from the same recording appear on the superb double DVD set of Galaxie 500 performances "Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste" - the DVDs are packed with live performances spanning the whole of Galaxie 500's all to short career - more details</p>
