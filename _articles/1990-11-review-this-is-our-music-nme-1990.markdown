GALAXIE 500  
This Is Our Music (Rough Trade LP/Cassette/CD)

LISTEN, THE dawn is breaking. Almost imperceptibly, crisp sunlight creeps
across the frosty soundscape of Galaxie 500, causing the gently strumming
American trio to stir from their hibernation. Stretching talented little arms,
they decide the world is ready for their third album.

Except for recent single 'Fourth of July', a fine mid-tempo rumble of scorched
thunder, every track unfolds in trademark slow motion. Eight sonic equivalents
of a '70s wax lamp, at once mesmerising and monotonous, timelessly beautiful
yet oddly nostalgic, pulsating with psychedelic colours.

The title is borrowed from Ornette Coleman, and there are moments of jazzy
shimmering in amongst the whispers. 'Spook', for instance, drenches
understated orchestration in slowly melting melody, while the translucent 'Way
Up High' sports a sweetly rambling flute solo courtesy of producer Kramer.

Occasionally they continue milking tunes long after they are dry. The crashing
guitar breakers and splashing cymbals of 'Summertime' trail off into
overcooked oblivion, while Naomi's folky rendering of Yoko Ono's 'Listen, the
Snow Is Falling' drags out like a junior school choir practice. Massed
recorder-playing seems likely at any moment.

But elsewhere there is artful use of church organ and bubbly wah-wah, choppy
Morse Code axe-slapping and oodles of hypnotic ambience. There is also quiet
humour like the synthetic ceremonial brass on the sublime 'King of Spain, Part
Two'.

Dean's thick-set garage guitar and distant echo voice reach right back to
veteran groaner Neil Young, even if the Galaxies are sometimes too deceptively
soothing for their own good. **(7)**
