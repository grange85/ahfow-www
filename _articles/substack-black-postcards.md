Towards the end of Luna’s first life (1992 to 2005) Dean Wareham started hinting in interviews that he was thinking of writing a book - when asked about his post-Luna plans he told Pitchfork:

<blockquote>
I don't know, I could write my memoirs, because I used to, you know. I was writing them for the website for a while, for the tour diary, and putting a lot of work into them. And finally it occurred to me no one's paying me for this, this is hard work
</blockquote>

At some point this speculation turned into reality:

<blockquote>
I got call from this editor at Penguin, Scott Moyers. He’s since left, but he asked me if I’d given any thought about writing a book. I had a few chapters and had almost written a book proposal, so I sent a few chapters. It all happened very quickly. He read them, loved them and got permission to go ahead.

The book finally got finished and published in March 2008 and was described in the synposis on the dust jacket as "a bewitching memoir about the lures, torments, and rewards of making and performing music in two iconic indie rock bands",

Lou Reed provided a promotional quote for the back cover "I have always been a fan of Dean Wareham’s and have worked with him and Luna many times, I love reading the thoughts of frontmen, I think it’s a great read for the fan of adventure."

Hmm "fan of adventure"?

Around the time that the book was published Dean sent me a copy, inscribed (you can see the dedication below - I’d just blush if I typed it out) and I read it, pretty much in one sitting… and then read it again. As I wrote pieces for AHFoW, I’d invariably refer to the book for fact-checking, or quotes, or back story. The more I flipped around hunting down something I remembered reading but couldn't remember where in the book it was, the more battered and bothered the book became.

Of course it’s more tatty than it would be if there had been an index. I’m guessing someone decided that the book didn’t need one - [this blog post](https://alanrinzler.com/2009/01/every-non-fiction-book-needs-an-index-heres-why/) suggests that the author is expected to pay some or all of the cost of an index - and they don’t come cheap so I sort of understand that someone might decide that an index is a luxury that can’t always be afforded. But even in the age of full text searches every word-heavy non-fiction book should have an index, as the above link says "there’s a big difference between an alphabetical list of keywords [...] and a real index that organizes and cross-references the theme and message of the author’s intentions according to topics, individuals, and relationships." A professional index made by a professional indexer creates a beautiful and useful (I'm almost enclined to say _essential_) addition to a publication.

But Black Postcards, has no index so... here is my first edition of Dean Wareham’s Black Postcards:

This raises the question what should a fan’s copy of a book look like?

 - Should it be treasured, carefully read, and filed away in as near mint condition as is possible?
 - Or better still not read at all, with a second viewing copy for use?
 - Should it be a constant source of research so that the repeated reference to it wears it down? So it looks like an invaluable source!
 - Should it look like it’s been loved?
 - Should it look like it’s been cherished?

Mine, as you can see, fits into the _repeated reference_ and _been loved_ categories - I imagine a book collector would be going into conniptions at the sight of my copy of - a signed copy sold in eBay for $75 a couple of months back!

Obviously mine is more special than those (see the dedication below) and I even get a 'thank you' in the back. Having a name beginning with **A** finds me credited first - see also the end credits of [Tell Me Do You Miss Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81Sv57rbujA) - this makes up for all the years of having to sit at the front of the classroom at school!

Dean mentioned in an interview the reason for that acknowledgement:

<blockquote>
I drew on the journals that I kept on the road. And I also had tour itineraries, with the names of clubs and hotels, and <strong>there is even a website online ([A] Head Full of Wishes) that has a list of almost every show I played with Galaxie 500 and Luna</strong>. I usually found if I could remember the club, then I could remember something about that day, especially if something interesting had happened. And certain incidents and nasty arguments just stick in your brain. And the songs themselves often trigger memories of what was going on in my life.
</blockquote>

Of course, as my copy started to fall apart I did track down another copy - but, the one that’s falling apart is the one with the dedication so - this is my primary copy - and yes, it’s still the one I use for research.

I also have two copies of the fantastic _Temperature’s Rising_ the Galaxie 500 oral history compiled by Mike McGonigal. This, like Black Postcards, is an invaluable research tool that also doesn't have an index - although it's quite picture heavy so can probably get away with not having one. My research copy has lasted better than Black Postcards but is starting to show some wear. In this instance my first copy wasn't the one signed by Damon and Naomi, I bought that later and definitely falls into the _looks like it's been cherished_ category.

Every Galaxie 500 fan should have a copy of this and you can still [get a copy for $30 from 20\|20\|20](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/p/galaxie500-book).

_Footnotes:_

Of course a book shouldn't fall apart so easily or catastrophically, and I have equally, or more loved books that have lasted better so I'm inclined to blame the printers/binders for it looking quite this bad!

So… yes I do have a second copy… one for show, and one for blow.

And I don’t have a digital copy of Black Postcards so sadly can’t do full-text searches anyway.
