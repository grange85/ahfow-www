OK... this is a post of a tragic obsessive who values accuracy above almost everything... if you can't get it right you need to try harder!

Three things that have annoyed me while documenting the history of the bands I love:

## THREE - Get the name of your own songs right!

Dear bands I love, you wrote most, and recorded all of these songs you could at least be consistent in your naming - here are some examples:

 - On the original Uncollected disc released with the box set in 1996 there was a track called {% ahfowtrack "I Can't Believe its Me," %} an early version of a song that eventuallty became {% ahfowtrack "Pictures" %}. On last year's Uncollected Noise New York release the song is titled **Can't Believe it's Me**  it's _missing the singular first person pronoun_ at the start of the title.
 - On Dean & Britta's debut album L'avventura they recorded a cover of Lee Hazlewood's {% ahfowtrack "You Turned My Head Around" %} on the accompanying video it is called **You Turn My Head Around**, it is no longer in the past tense? To be fair it seems Hazlewood, or his estate, used the names interchangeably but you shouldn't give the same song two different titles! When I publically expressed concern at this inconsistency Dean emailed me:
<blockquote>
<p>My original 7" single calls the song "You Turned My Head Around", which is how it is registered with the songwriting society also, so that's what I went with for our CD.</p>
<p>But on the Lee Hazlewood CD "The Cowboy and the Lady" (the song was not on the original vinyl release of that album, but was added as a bonus to the CD) it is listed as "You Turn".</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Email from Dean (March 2008)</p>
 - Luna's cover of Galaxie 500's {% ahfowtrack "Fourth of July" %} on Luna Live is listed as **4th of July** - numbers instead of words, some might consider this minor! I don't! See also {% ahfowtrack "Four Thousand Days" %} on the same release. 

## TWO - Get your dates right

OK I whined about this when the new Galaxie 500 _official bootleg_ album was announced a couple of months back - but it's worth repeating. There are only two correct orders for dates if you're using numbers - you either start at the biggest time period (year) and then move through the other time periods to the smallest one (day) **in order**. Or, you do it the other way around. You **never** go medium (month), then smallest (day), then biggest (year) - it not only makes no sense - it causes uncertainty! I have so many recordings that have been incorrectly dated because of this. Additionally if you use the big-medium-small system with your file names they will sort correctly on your computer!

Fortunately, and it's the only saving grace, that official bootleg, [CBGB 12.13.88 ]() was recorded on the 13th of December, and since there are only 12 months confusion is thankfully averted. But, it's still wrong.

Also, did we learn nothing from Y2K, although I'll grant that no one in the future is likely to think that it was recorded in 2088 (or 1888)... but still!

They should have asked me and it would have been called Galaxie 500 - **CBGB 13th December 1988**!


## ONE - Get your facts right

In the first edition of Dean's Black Postcards, while recounting the events of Luna's last show at The Bowery Ballroom in 2005 he asserts that thier final encore was 23 Minutes in Brussles followed by Indian Summer. I wasn't there, but I know this is wrong. Setlists were posted to The Galaxie 500 Mailing List pretty much as soon as the show was over, and not long after that recordings arrived. Luna played Indian Summer **then** 23 Minutes in Brussels. 

When I mentioned this at the time a few people responded saying that "it doesn't really matter does it?" - Well, yes it most certainly does for these two (and probably many other) reasons

1. If we know that this, in a _factual_ book, is wrong, how can we be confident that everything else is in the book is correct?
2. When you want to cite authoratatively what is more authoratative that the person who was on stage that day. So, if you wanted to, for example, mention that the last song Luna ever played live was 23 Minutes in Brussels on Wikipedia it could be removed because Dean Wareham wrote **in a book** that that wasn't the case!

Thankfully this was corrected in the paperback edition of the book so if I wanted to add that to Wikipedia I could... although, it turned out not to have been the last somg Luna ever played live so has lost a little of its value!
