"Surprising" in this instance I guess means songs **I** am surprised by whether it's because it was something I loved before it arrived onto AHFoW's radar, or just something that seems so far removed from what I would have expected. I'll do this as a countdown from five to one, but to be honest all except number one are probably not all that surprising.

First though I'll get a couple of surprises that I'm **not** including out of the way:

In 2007 Luna released a cover of Paula Abdul's {% ahfowtrack "Straight Up" %} on the _Guilty by Association_ compilation - so I guess surprising for two reasons (a) it was a new Luna release even though the band had split up two years previously and (b) it was a Paula Abdul track. BUT... when Dean shared it with me ahead of release he sort of watered down the surprising nature of it somewhat:

<blockquote>
The original concept for the album was supposed to be "guilty 
pleasures", songs that you are ashamed to like. "Straight Up" was 
suggested by the A&R guy. I told him it wasn't a guilty pleasure of 
mine - I simply don't like the song. But it turned out okay.

In December of last year... Dean & Britta finally caved into my relentless badgering and [played a few bars of Macca's Xmas masterpiece _Wonderful Christmastime_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz71Az2hijM) - not a surprise because I always knew I'd wear them down eventually... and it was just a few bars anyway!

So onto my five genuine surprises:

### Number FIVE - Galaxie 500 - {% ahfowtrack "Submission" %} (Sex Pistols cover)
When Galaxie 500 recorded Submission for their second John Peel Session in 1990 it seemed baffling - the idea that Galaxie 500 and The Sex Pistols were even on the same planet seemed bizarre - although the more I think about it the less surprising it becomes. I was never a Pistols fan as such but I had, and played regularly, a copy of _Never Mind The Bollocks_ so was very familair with the song and to be honest Submission is the most likely track on the album for Galaxie 500 to cover, and they don't really deviate all that far from the original. So it was surprising only in theory - in reality it turned into a perfect fit.

### Number FOUR - Luna - {% ahfowtrack "Sweetness" %} (Yes cover)
Back in the late 70s and early 80s during my musical development I got into a lot of music - jumble sales were a phenomenal learnng resource, and I bought a lot of records from them. A couple of years ago I was going through some boxes of my records that had been stashed in my dad's garage and came across five albums by Yes... was I a Yes fan, I didn't think so, but FIVE ALBUMS? I put one on, The Yes Album - the bands second LP, and was literally singing along to a song I hadn't listened to for probably close to 40 years. Was I Yes fan? It was really looking like I had been... and probably still was. So, when Luna announced their reunion covers album [A Sentimental Education]() and reported that they were covering Yes's Sweetness... it was quite a shock! My past and present colliding. Although Sweetness was from Yes's first album which I didn't listen to as much as the more proggy ones from The Yes Album onwards.

### Number THREE - Cagney & Lacee - {% ahfowtrack "Borderline" %} (Madonna cover)
To be honest most of Cagney & Lacee's output has been surprising, even the one non-cover was a surprise because it wasn't a cover! One of my early 80s jumble sale buys was a couple of Madonna promo singles - Lucky Star and Borderline - and, despite them not really being my cup of tea (I was buying lots of Yes albums ffs!) I fell in love with their bright poppiness. Cagney & Lacee released their cover on an Earworm single in 1998. Dean later covered another Madonna track on L'avventura but by then Dean covering Madonna wasn't a surprise any more!

### Number TWO - Dean Wareham - {% ahfowtrack "Wand'rin' Star" %} (Lee Marvin cover)
The fact that Dean and Cheval Sombre recorded an album of "cowboy songs" was a bit of a surprise in itself but that one of those was a cover of Lee Marvin's Wand'rin' Star was the real shocker. It's a song that, once you've heard Lee's version you couldn't really imagine anyone else even trying it. It is so perfect and unique that it would be mad for anyone to even consider covering it. When Dean mentioned it to me in an email I responded "Wand'rin' Star without Lee Marvin's voice is taking a bit of getting used to" he replied:

<blockquote>
I think in the USA people are not so familiar with “Wandering Star” — it was #1 in UK and in Australia but not here. But yeah it’s sorta impossible to top Lee Marvin, it’s such a great example of a non-singer vocal, you can hear that he is nervous and unsteady but it works for the character.
</blockquote>

But, I guess if anyone could pull it off it was going to be Dean... and he did!

### Number ONE - Luna - {% ahfowtrack "Killed by Death" %} (Motörhead cover)
Anyone who's known me, or read AHFoW for any length of time probably won't be so surprised by the number one surprise. In 1979 I heard Motörhead for the first time and my life changed completely. I'd been through my Beatles and glam phases, but they were inherited musical loves. Motörhead was the first love that was all my own... it was also the first time I became a _record collector_ as well as a music fan.

Luna's cover came (to me at least) completely out of the blue - they recorded it for the AV Club's "Undercover" series and when Jen sent the link to me in Facebook I gasped...

<blockquote>
<strong>Jen:</strong> Andy- is this like the intersection of Awesome for you?<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> Oh. My. God!!!<br/>
<strong>Jen:</strong> You didn't know!!!! What an incredible surprise for you!<br/>
<strong>Me:</strong> I feel quite weak<br/>
<strong>Jen:</strong> I feel so absolutely thrilled for you!

Obviously it's not Motörhead's finest hour - [that came five years earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VNUyjRRjxM) - and it wasn't the classic line-up - but it's Luna, covering Motörhead! And, look how much Sean is enjoying this!
