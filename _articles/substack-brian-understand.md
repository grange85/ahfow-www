## Part One: Galaxie 500 at The Subterania - 27th June 1990
So… at, I’d guess about 22:30 on 27th June 1990 Galaxie 500 returned to the stage of The Subterania in West London, joined by Kramer, and played Ceremony, followed by Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste - and, although I didn't realise it at the time, the course of my life took a turn... here's how:

### 1989
I was working in the film stores at the _BBC Film and Videotape Library_ - not a great job but the pay wasn’t too bad (with some overtime) and enabled me to get out and see gigs. I’d already been there five years (apart from a 18 months as a film projectionist) so it was looking like I was stuck there. Then, Ken joined the BBC (and there'll be more about Ken in the second half of this post) and he knew music better than anyone I had encountered before, and music that I liked, and music I didn't know but that he knew I would like. He also knew music journalists so occasionally tapes would arrive with new music to listen to. One of those tapes had Galaxie 500 on it. I was smitten.

Ken was also someone to go to gigs with, and we went to a lot of gigs! It was with Ken that I [didn't get to see Galaxie 500 supporting The Sundays](/2024/05/06/my-record-collection-133-galaxie-500-camden-the-falcon-11-02-90-mc/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=from+the+archive) in February 1990 and it was with Ken that I finally did get to [see Galaxie 500, at The Subterania in June 1990](/2018/08/22/video-galaxie-500-london-1990/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=from+the+archive).

### 22:30 - 27th June 1990
The Subterania was a club located underneath [the Westway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westway_(London)) in West London. Most gigs around then were happening in North London or [the West End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London) so it was nice having a venue a little closer to home so we saw quite a few gigs there over the years (although I somehow managed to _not see_ Galaxie 500's first gig there the previous year). 

To be honest I can't really remember the specifics of Galaxie 500's set, but, main set over, at approx 22:30 Galaxie 500 returned to the stage for an encore, they were joined by Kramer and played {% ahfowtrack "Ceremony" %}, followed by {% ahfowtrack "Don’t Let Our Youth Go To Waste" %}. I was mesmerised.

Galaxie 500 were supported by Teenage Fanclub who I was already a fan of... although this might have been the first time I saw them - I also saw them in December of that year in a show that was filmed for Snub - sharp-eyed viewers can see me in [this chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BYnpEhG0wU) (although my eyes aren't sharp enough any more!). 

### 1994
I’d been messing around with the Internet from pretty early on and towards the end of 1994 I had acquired some free web space. But had no idea what to do with it? So I taught myself how to code for the web by building a Galaxie 500 fan web site, because I still remembered that feeling from four years before. I was now a webmaster!

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/misc/a-head-full-of-wishes-1997.jpg" "A Head Full of Wishes (circa 1997)" %}

I had now been working in the film stores for ten years… it was _definitely_ looking like I was stuck there!

### 1995
I set up a mailing list for Galaxie 500 fans (more on that next week)

### 1999
In 1999 I applied to become one of the BBC Information & Archives (as the library was now called) first "media managers" - I was turned down for the job but thankfully Richard Wright, one of the interviewers appreciated that my knowledge of the Internet and the World Wide Web acquired over the five years of running A Head Full of Wishes might be useful so he invented a job for me, and put me to work on a European digitisation project, I shared an office with the three people who had got those media manager jobs that I hadn't.

{% ahfowimage "https://cdn.grange85.co.uk/substack/my-desk-at-wmr-october-2005.jpg" "My desk (circa 2005)" %}

Around that time the media managers were asked to help to develop a BBC wide intranet site to assist people in using the Internet, and I&A's internal tools, to do their research. Since I was the only person who had any experience developing for the web (_because of Galaxie 500_) I ended up doing quite a lot of the work on _Research Central_ and at some point it became my full time job.

Research Central changed over the years, it became research.gateway, and then Research Gateway - the job changed, the site changed - as people learned the web they needed less help and more tools - we gave them that.

### 2010 
The powers that be decided that my skills (_because of Galaxie 500_) would be put to better use not as part of the Information & Archives but as part of the wider BBC intranet. Lots of people thought this was a good thing - but… taking me away from archives wasn’t good at all. Unfortunately in the ensuing years a variety of managers came and went and none of them had a clue what to do with us and how to best make use of us. I had a few months seconded into an Internet development team which was good, but most of the next three years were frustrating.

### 2013
After too many years of doing nothing and not getting anywhere I happened upon an advert for a job as the Webmaster at The National Archives (TNA). I applied for, and got, the job _because of, you know… Galaxie 500_. I was back in an archive. Home. And I was now _officially_ a "webmaster"!

{% ahfowimage "https://cdn.grange85.co.uk/substack/tna-with-dean-and-britta.jpg" "Outside TNA on my last day - with Dean and Britta!" %}

### 2020 to the present
I spent seven very happy years at TNA before COVID threw a spanner in the works, I still enjoyed my work and loved TNA, but working from home didn't really suit me. Hazel and I then moved 300 miles away from my workplace so working remotely became the only option! I stuck it out for a few more years and then, when I arrived at the age of 60, I decided to retire - and suddenly AHFoW became my only _job_!

So, here we are - 35 years on from that gig at The Subterania that basically turned me onto the path that I'm still on. It's been quite a ride!

## Part Two - You Don't Want a Boyfriend
When Ken arrived at the BBC he arrived with a past - once it became clear that we were going to be friends he handed me that past - it came as a 7" single by a band called _Brian_ who, at the time was him, and his friend Niall. It also came with a newspaper clipping that declared that the single - A Million Miles - was Hot Press magazine's fourth best single of 1989 (and to be honest it was better than the three above it).

{% ahfowimage "https://cdn.grange85.co.uk/substack/brian-hot-press-singles-of-89.jpg" "Brian - Hot Press singles of 1989 - #4" %}

He also arrived with plans.

In 1990 Ken, Niall, and myself spent a lot of time in a bedroom in a house share, just off the [Hanger Lane Gyratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanger_Lane_gyratory) in west London demo-ing the songs that would eventually become Brian's first album _Understand_. Ken and Niall were the musicians, and I was the one figuring out the borrowed and rented equipment, that we were using to record, from well-thumbed manuals, or photocopies of manuals. Sadly Googling the instructions was still eight years away.

At one point over a meal at nearby L.A. Pizza I was asked to be the band's bassist, I accepted but never really had the skill or dedication to be that, so soon we decided that my skills better served the band as driver, technician, money-lender, and anything else that I was asked to do for it. I loved it!

{% ahfowimage "https://cdn.grange85.co.uk/substack/ken-avalon-road-1991.jpg" "Ken in Avalon Road, Ealing, 1991" %}

The first physical manifestation of all of this was a seven inch single that was put out on our own record label - Ken likes to say it was my label but that always felt a bit generous - I was just the _front_ - the label was called "Detzi Records" and was named after [Detzi Kruszyński who was a football player who played for Wimbledon](https://www.historicaldons.com/player.php?od=4&id=478) at the time. I think we chose the name less in tribute but more for the mysterious obscurity of it. The address on the label was that of my parents house in Cobham - and the only people who noticed, and made use of, the address were Matt and Claire of Sarah Records who sent Ken a letter there.

{% ahfowimage "https://cdn.grange85.co.uk/substack/detzi-krusynski-panini-1990.jpg" "Detzi Kruszynski Panini sticker 1990" %}

The photo on the front cover of the single was taken outside Ealing Town Hall by another BBC film library employee Martin - seven years later Hazel and I were photographed coming out of the same building by the same photographer after we were married. The _story_ on the back was written by Graham Linehan. I did take some video of the photo shoot but sadly that has gone astray (unless Ken has it somewhere).

{% ahfowimage "https://cdn.grange85.co.uk/substack/brian-you-dont-want-a-boyfriend.jpg" "Brian - You Don't Want a Boyfriend" %}

The single was Hot Press's 18th best single of the year (and to be honest it was better that the seventeen above it).

Ken signed to Setanta Records and Boyfriend, and the rest of the recordings, became Brian's first album _Understand_ an absolute masterpiece that I am so proud to have had a small part in (and my name on the back of). A short time later the album was followed up with the equally splendid Planes EP.

Both Understand and Planes are being reissued this week by boutique label [Needle Mythology](https://orcd.co/brian) renamed as _Understood_ and with the previously unreleased track _If You Knew_ that mysteriously never made it onto the album.

{% ahfowimage "https://cdn.grange85.co.uk/substack/brian-understand.jpg" "Brian - Understand (and news clippings)" %}

Ken went on to record a second album as Brian. _Bring Trouble_ was recorded at September Sound studios, a much more professional set up and is also excellent. By then, the Internet was becoming important so my job had moved from being all those other things (although I still did the driving) to running the Brian website, and an email newsletter.

{% ahfowimage "https://cdn.grange85.co.uk/substack/brian-website-1997.jpg" "caption" %}

And that was it... Ken returned to Dublin, and became an entertainment journalist... and my brief and exciting sojourn on the fringes of the music industry came quietly to an end.
