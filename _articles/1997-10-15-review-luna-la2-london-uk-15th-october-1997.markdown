OK, horrified as I am that I didn't manage to post the first review of this
show on my own mailing list - here's my view of events...

Arrived shortly before Cornershop - so I missed the first band too.

Last time I saw Cornershop I was converted - I'd never really been a fan but
that night I was moved - then I discovered that "Woman's Gotta Have It" is a
pretty good album - and since then they've released what is a serious
challenger for album of the year with "When I Was Born...".

But last night I was disappointed - they just never seemed to get going -
"WOG" and "Good Ship" were only average and "Brimful of Asha" should
have been great but barely got me bobbing, a pretty good closing "Jullander
Shere" almost saved the day but I know they can do better.

The crowd noticeably thinned for Luna - but it was still probably the biggest
and most enthusiastic crowd I'd seen at one of their shows, and tonight they
rocked - they seem to be getting a much harder edge to their sound of late -
"Time to Quit" positively buzzed, and even "California" seemed like the
evil brother of the song that's been gracing American Express TV adverts over
here.

They closed the main set with a glorious IHOP (the studio version seems so
much better having heard it live), and enccored with "Chinatown" and (of
course) an amazing "Indian Summer" - I keep thinking that one day I'll get
bored with them doing "Indian Summer" live - but after last night I'm not
sure I ever will.

After last years discussions that Luna were perhaps becoming a touch formulaic
live, this show managed to blow that theory right out of the water.

The evening's only down side was only the songs they didn't play - we weren't
treated to a Galaxie number, and there were a stack of my faves that didn't
get played - but I guess when you have four albums (plus the Galaxie 500 back
catalogue) to draw on you've got to accept that there will be disappointing
omissions.

(although they could have played longer!)
