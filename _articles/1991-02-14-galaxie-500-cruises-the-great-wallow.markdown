##  Galaxie 500 Cruises The Great Wallow - Mike Boehm Los Angeles Times (14/March/1991)

Sure, the pursuit of happiness is the American way.  
But sometimes a person just has to ignore the famous words of Thomas Jefferson
and Bobby McFerrin.  
Sometimes you have to turn off the onslaught of advertising cues that try to
instill guilt in those not chasing a brighter, slimmer, richer, more
fulfilling future.  
Sometimes what's needed is a good wallow.  
While hardly a band for all occasions, Galaxie 500 is definitely a band for
those occasions.  
The rock trio from Boston, which opens for the Cocteau Twins on Monday at UC
Irvine's Bren Events Center, makes melancholy mood music evocative of long,
rainy days, when it seems far better to watch the world from inside a cocoon
than to engage life and get all wet.  
Dean Wareham's high, tremulous plaint of a voice is the perfect, commiserating
companion for those gray funks (think of Neil Young singing a slower, tearier
version of "Only Love Can Break Your Heart"). Wareham's guitar playing sets up
a slow-moving, encompassing haze designed to hold the mood in. Bassist Naomi
Yang and drummer Damon Krukowski are careful to make the rhythm waft, never
prod.  
Then, at some point in most songs, Galaxie 500 will realize that, wallowing or
not, it is supposed to be a rock band. So the beat will gather intensity, and
Wareham's guitar will start to gain mass and presence, throwing off groaning
feedback. But just as Galaxie 500 seems on the verge of asserting itself --
the way such melancholic-rock mentors as the Velvet Underground or Joy Divison
typically would -- it will end the song or pull back. The cocoon is too warm
and pleasant. The wallowing is just too delicious to let go.  
Does this mean that Galaxie 500's members are the wallowing types?  
"No," said Wareham in a recent phone interview from his home in New York,
speaking in a soft voice that still bears an accented tinge from his childhood
days in New Zealand. "None of us are sad people or melancholy. It's just the
way the music comes out for some reason.  
"My favorite music is really melancholy," he added, citing such sources as the
Velvet Underground, Television, Big Star and Joy Division -- all names from
the canon of influences for contemporary alternative-rock bands that have a
pop-lover's sweet tooth for melody.  
Drummer Krukowski, in a separate interview, seconded the idea that it is
important to separate the singer's (or player's) personality from the song.  
"It's just what we like," he said. "I don't think it's that melancholy,
anyway. It's not a very gloomy thing to play music in a rock band. It's kind
of a silly, fun thing. It's not like wandering on a heath, reciting Byron to
yourself. I do understand (why the band is perceived as downbeat). The bands
we've always loved and imitated are certainly on the melancholy half of
things."  
Wareham's lyrics tend to be doleful, but sometimes a funny absurdity creeps
in. "Fourth of July," from the band's current album, "This is Our Music,"
shares a theme -- sorrow amid celebration -- with the X/Dave Alvin anthem of
the same name. A listener focusing only on Wareham's pale, lugubrious delivery
might miss the humor in some of his lines that seems to gently mock depressive
wallowing: "I wrote a poem on a dog biscuit / and your dog refused to look at
it. . . . I decided to have a bed-in, but I forgot to invite anybody."  
To listen to Wareham and Krukowski, who are both 27, Galaxie 500's distinctive
sound and mood are more a matter of happenstance than a concerted drive to
express their inner souls.  
The three members all attended an upper-crust private school in Manhattan,
then, by coincidence rather than plan, all wound up as undergraduates at
Harvard. Getting involved in a rock band also was purely a matter of accident,
as Krukowski tells it.  
One of their Harvard classmates "wanted a band so he could meet girls," the
drummer said. Because he was willing to pay for all the band's equipment,
"Dean and I went along for the ride" and became novice rockers.  
Dubbed Speedy and the Castanets, this precursor to Galaxie 500 played Clash
and Sex Pistols covers and entertained hopes of landing a Boston club gig. The
best they could do, Krukowski said, was develop a reputation for ineptness
while playing at Harvard events. Then the founder left: "He had a flirtation
with a fundamentalist Christian group, which told him rock 'n' roll was the
devil's music," Krukowski recalled. "They also told him to forgive his debts,"
which meant that Wareham and Krukowski got to keep the gear their departed
band mate had bought them.  
In 1987, after all three members had graduated from college, Yang, who hadn't
previously played in a rock band, took up the bass and joined her old friends.
Suddenly, Krukowski said, what had been "a terrible-sounding band" began to
show possibilities. "It's a mystery to us why it started sounding good after
so much struggle."  
The band named itself after a far-from-sporty Ford sedan from the 1960s.  
"It just sounded nice, and looked nice written down," Wareham explained. "It
didn't mean anything in particular. We wanted to let the band define the name,
rather than the other way around."  
While based in Boston (Wareham has since moved back to New York to be closer
to his girl friend), Galaxie 500 has not identified with that city's prolific
alternative-rock scene.  
"We're not a hugely popular band in Boston. I don't really feel an affinity,"
Wareham said. "Boston has a lot of bands. It doesn't have a lot of good bands,
in my opinion."  
After all, Krukowski said, with more than a trace of irony in his voice,
running with the pack wouldn't have fit Galaxie 500's image as a solitary,
brooding bunch.  
"We've always been down on the Boston scene. I guess it's our melancholy
nature. We're lonely in the crowd."  
Working with New York-based producer Kramer, Galaxie 500 recorded "Today,"
released in 1988 on a small Boston label, followed by "On Fire" and "This Is
Our Music" for the more prominent independent label, Rough Trade (Rough Trade
recently reissued "Today," as well).  
Band members foresee a move to a major label for the next Galaxie 500 album,
but it is not likely to bring changes in a style that could be described in
Youngian terms as "Muted Glory." While generally praised by critics, the band
has gotten some barbed comments for its languid, reserved sound. One New York
Times writer theorized that the sound and sensibility of Galaxie 500 and
fellow lassitude-rockers Mazzy Star exemplify "a kind of cultural catatonia"
afflicting a post-collegiate "generation caught between dead ends." (On the
other hand, it could merely exemplify the timeless human need to indulge in a
nice wallow.)  
"Up to this point, we haven't contemplated (changes)," Wareham said when asked
whether the band had a more affirmative, energized side to show. "You can't
let critics or the public or record companies dictate to you what your next
move should be."
