The lift is in a slightly grotty upstairs room of a pub in the very cool south
coast resort of Brighton, having arrived too early (first ones in) we sat
through an overlong set by a support act who had a couple of favourable points
- a pleasant sound and one occasionally special voice - but one major negative
point - a frustrating lack of variety. Two songs in I was enjoying, ten songs
in I was tearing my hair out.

Damon & Naomi arrived on stage, set up their gear and proceeded to battle
through sound problems and deliver a fine set. The Brighton air had obviously
given them a more relaxed outlook to the point that the feeding back was
almost acceptable. A healthy bunch of oldies including "New York City", "This
Car...", "Information Age" were mixed in with a couple of new songs, "I
Dreamed of the Caucasus" and "Judah and The Macabees" plus a delightfully
beautiful take on Big Star's "Blue Moon". Not a gem of a show but one to wipe
the memory of the previous years awkward Dingwalls performance.
