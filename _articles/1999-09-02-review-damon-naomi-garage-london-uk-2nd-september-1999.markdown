I arrived and caught most of the support act, Tram (I think) and was
sufficiently impressed, but for them persistently giving their songs fake
endings, which is frustrating for a keen audience, and I can't believe it's
not frustrating for the band.

Damon & Naomi took to the stage and played another enjoyable set, covering
pretty much the same ground as they for the two previous shows, a gorgeous
"Laika" was one of the high points. They also played a genuinely new song "so
new we're still fighting over the lyrics". "Mirror Phase" saw Damon & Naomi
alternating the vocal which was quite unusual but effective.

Another fine performance.

If I have one criticism of these three shows it's that none of them were long
enough, Terrastock obviously had a tight schedule to stick to, but the other
two shows would have benefited from maybe shorter support acts or a later
curfew to allow Damon & Naomi to put in a show over an hour long. Having said
that I've been treated to three very good shows in eight days so I guess I
shouldn't really complain.
