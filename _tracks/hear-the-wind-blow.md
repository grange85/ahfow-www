track-lyrics: "Hear The Wind Blow\n\nSometimes you feel\nyou've traveled the whole wide world\nAnd sometimes it seems\nyou haven't gone so very far\n\nI know you're tired and your shoes are filled with sand\nBut I'll take you anywhere you want to go\n\nI'll give you the wind\n  to take you to the oceanside\nOnce he was an orphan boy\nNow he's not so alone\n\nNighttime is all we have the hours move so slowly now\nAnd I'll take you anywhere you want to go\n\nHear the wind blow\nBlow through every tree\nInside every house\nIf you're listening\n\nAnd if you're tired\nAnd you're weary\nRest your sleepy head\nHere beside me"
