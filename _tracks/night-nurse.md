track-lyrics: "You are the treacle in my pie\nYou are the splinter in my eye\nYou make the ice melt, the butter run\nYou are the ink stain, you are the one\n\nSleep together the milkyway\nSleep forever and a day\nLovely jewels in joy designed\nLa la la la...\n\nI am the local, I am express\nI am a tourist in a summer dress\nI am the night nurse, I am the most\nI am the visitor, you are the host\n\nChorus again\n\nMy wings are clipped\nMy drinks are sipped\nMy lips are lipped\nMy lid is flipped\n\nI am the night nurse\nI am the most\nI am the visitor\nYou are the host\n\nChorus"
