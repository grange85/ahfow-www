track-lyrics: "We were brown and we were down\nWe were black and we were slack\nWe are digging us a hole\nThere is nothing in this bowl\nOn the way, to Kansas C.\nWho are we supposed to be?\nIt's raining rain, it's raining snow\nTell me where you wanna go\n \nI don't want to take your call\nI refuse to climb your wall\nI don't want to ride your bus\nI am tired of all of us\nOn the way, to Kansas C.\nWho are we supposed to be?\nIt's raining rain, It's raining snow\nTell me where you wanna go"
