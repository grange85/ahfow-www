track-lyrics: "Well I'm sorry about the weather\nAnd I'm sorry that the drive was much too far\nSeems like everything is business\nAnd were sorry all the time\n\nBut when we're home (all alone)\nWhat is home (on your own)\nHome is home (all alone)\nWhere we love the weather\n\nAre you sorry that you love me\nAm I sorry that I love you too\nSeems it doesnt make a difference\nThat we're sorry all the time\n\nBut when we're home (all alone)\nWhat is home (on your own)\nHome is home (all alone)\nWhere we love the weather\n\nAll alone (what is home)\nOn my own (what is home)\nAll alone (on your own)\nAnd I love the weather"
