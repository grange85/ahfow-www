track-lyrics: "Breakfast in cemetery\nBoy tastin wild cherry\nTouch girl, apple blossom\nJust a boy playin possum\n\nWe'll come back for Indian Summer\nWe'll come back for Indian Summer\nWe'll come back for Indian Summer\nAnd go our seperate ways\n\nWhat is that cheerful sound?\nRain fallin on the ground\nWe'll wear a jolly crown\nBuckle up, we're wayward bound\n\nWe'll come back for Indian Summer\nWe'll come back for Indian Summer\nWe'll come back for Indian Summer\nAnd go our seperate ways\n\nMotorbike to cemetery\nPicnic on wild berries\nFrench toast with molasses\nCroquet and Baked Alaskas\n\nWe'll come back for Indian Summer\nWe'll come back for Indian Summer\nWe'll come back for Indian Summer\nAnd go our seperate ways\n\nCover me with rain\nWalk me down the lane\nI'll drink from your drain\nWe will never change\nNo matter what they say"
