track-lyrics: "When the rich die last\nLike the rabbits\nRunning from a lucky past\nFull of shadow cunning\nAnd the world lights up\nFor the final day\nWe will all be poor\nHaving had our say\nPut a blanket up on the window pane\nWhen the baby cries lullaby again\nAs the light goes out on the final day\nFor the people who never had a say\n\nThere is so much noise\nThere is too much heat\nAnd the living floor\nthrows you off your feet\nAs the final day falls into the night\nThere is peace outside\nin the narrow light"
