track-lyrics: "I told you that we've been through this but\nYou know I told you that before\nI try to find out where we missed but\nI gets to be such a bore\n\nCause ever since that time I told you so\nWell something gets my eye and it won't let go\nAnd then the stories and words are here and gone\nWell that's what you always say\n\nI try to sit and talk with you but\nYou know how moods change all the time\nI try to wait a week or two but\nBy then I'll probably change my mind\n\nCause ever since that time I told you so\nWell something gets my eye and it won't let go\nAnd then the stories and words are here and gone\nWell that's what you always say"
