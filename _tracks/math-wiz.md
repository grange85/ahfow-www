track-lyrics: "Where is he going?\nWhat has he done?\nWhat's to become of him\nI wrote a speech to my dad\nTwenty-one pages long\nHe twisted my jokes and swallowed their meanings\n\nI lay awake counting one, two and three,\nIt's alright, it's alright\nI fell asleep \nCounting eight, ten and four\nit's okay\n\nA twelve year old math wiz\nCame to me in my sleep\nHe knew all the answers\nWhich he kept to himself\nHe said I'd hate to be you\nWhen the big day comes\nThe look on your face\nWill be priceless"
