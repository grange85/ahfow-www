track-lyrics: "Up all night\nJust to feel the breeze\nAn attic room\nClosed for centuries\nThe turnaround\nThe change of key\nThe open door\nYou gave to me\nA dusty book\nWith tipped-in plates\nBrushes dipped\nIn fresh white paint\nAn open door\nMight lead you\nA million miles away\nBut this heart will stay\nBeside you"
