track-lyrics: "shall i tell you once again\ni didn't change my mind\nit changed all by itself\nnow they say that i'm unkind\nthere was nothin' i could do\nno decision to be made\nlittle by little\nit caught me surprise\n\ni don't know why\ni can't say how\n\nwho'm i gonna be\nwhat am i gonna do\ni've been foolin' everybody\ni've been uptown at the zoo\ni have seen the chimpanzes\nin the afternoon sun\nit's quiet at the snakehouse\nand my legs are turned to jelly\n\ni don't know why\ni can't say how\n\nwho're you gonna be\nwhen you walk into my life\ni turned so sentimental\ncause i have no one to talk to\nover and over\nit's a merry go round\nit changed all by itself\ndon't you say that i'm unkind"
