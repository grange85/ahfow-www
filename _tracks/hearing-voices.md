track-lyrics: "Your lips ain't movin\nYour body still\nBut voices are talkin somewhere\nI hear a jukebox\nFrench fries and beer\nAnd people are talkin somewhere\n\nAnd I know there's no one home\nBut I won't put down the phone\nI can't think where I should be\n\nI searched the kitchen\nPut my ear to the wall\nI looked in the freezer again\nSometimes a notion\nSwells like the ocean\nThen I can't think where I should be\n\nAnd I know there's no one home\nBut I won't put down the phone\nI can't think where I should be"
