track-lyrics: "There's a train of thought \nMaking all the local stops \nHere's where I get off \nThat is where I fall \nThere's a rule of thumb \nThat comes in handy \nIt isn't just your word \nIt's who you give it to \n\nCan you hear the whispers?\nThe deafening whispers \nCan you hear the whispers?\nGanging up on me \n\nAirport time \nMoves so quickly \nIn the airport lights \nWe look so sickly \nRemember the caress \nOf your magical fingers \nI did a foolish thing \nI must be a fool \n\nMy mind is playing tricks on me,\nMy life is catchin' up with me \nIt's so damn hard to disentangle \nMy emotions \nIf we ask for the impossible,\nMaybe they will give it to us \nCould it really be...\nOur luck is coming back?"
