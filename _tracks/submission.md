track-lyrics: "I'm on a submarine mission for you baby\nI feel the way you were going\nI picked you up on my TV screen\nI feel your undercurrent flowing\n\nSubmission going down down\ndragging me down\nSubmission I can't tell ya what I've found\n\nYou've pot me pretty deep baby\nI can't figure out your watery love.\nI gotta solve your mystery.\nYou're sitfing if out in heaven above.\n\nSubmission going down down\ndragging me down\nSubmission I can't tell ya what I've found\n\nFor there's a mystery.\nUnder the sea... Under a water come\n(share it)\n\nSubmission going down down\ndragging me down\nSubmission I can't tell ya what I've found"
