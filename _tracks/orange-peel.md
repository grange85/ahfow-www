track-lyrics: "Asleep with one eye open\nItâ€™s an innocent dream\nThe telephone is singing\nAnd Iâ€™ll do it again\n\nResting in your yellow room\nYour face looks so surreal\nI kissed you with my rabbit foot\nI made your orange peel\n\nOn Christy Street, the sinking sun\nHas set your face ablaze\nYour ruby is weeping\nAnd youâ€™re all in a daze\nI told you all my riddles\nAnd I made your sickness heal\nI kissed you with my rabbitâ€™s foot\nI made your orange peel\n\nShadows on the wall\nHeading for a fall"
