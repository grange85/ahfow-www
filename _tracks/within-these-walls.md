track-lyrics: "When I hold my hand above the flame\nWhen I hold my breath beneath the wave\nCome to me, find me there\nCome save me, find me there\nAll I have is you\nIn this world too unkind\nIn this place too cold\nIn this night that is too long\nWhen I lose sight of what is real\nWhen I can't escape the way I feel\nCome to me, find me there\nCome save me, find me there\nAll I have is you\nIn this world too unkind\nIn this place too cold\nIn this night that is too long"
