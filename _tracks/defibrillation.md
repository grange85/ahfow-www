track-lyrics: "Lives crossing other lives\nIn a network of nerves\nCrossed signal â€” a twitch at the end of the line\nYour doubt reaches inside me\nAcross this network of nerves\nFlat line â€” alarm sounds â€” but I'm not the one\nThis I is not me, it's possession\nElectrical wires of relation: defibrillation\nYour doubt reaches inside\nInto my network of nerves\nRed light - alarm sounds - but I'm not the one\nThis I is not me, it's possession\nElectrical bonds of relation: defibrillation\nCome tomorrow I'll be another care from the past\nThis I is not me, it's possession\nDefibrillation: separation"
