track-lyrics: "Tell me who it was \nLet the creeps into my life \nTell me who it was \nLet the creeps into the house \nWell I guess that it was me \nWho handed out the key \nI gots to be more careful \nNext time \nSome very clever people \nHave got it figured out \nLet me say now \nYou are in grave danger \nI'll open all the drawers \nAnd look behind the socks \nSo where are you \nThis time \n\nDoes anybody see it?\nDoes anybody care?\nA hideous trick \nHas been played on all of us \nA saddle of deception \nA sauce of nasty lies \nGreetings from the chateau \nFor the very last time"
