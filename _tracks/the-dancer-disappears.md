track-lyrics: |
  I was the arrow, I was the bow 
  I love to give but I'm ready to go 
  Now that we’re here, I'm ready to leave
  The whole wide world behind

  Bring back the magic and let the match
  There's a dream that I'm open to catch
  Now that we’re here, I'm ready to leave
  The whole wide world behind

  Now in the twilight of the psychedelic years
  Roll back the highlights til' the dancer disappears, til' the dancer disappears

  Bring back the magic and let the match
  There's a star that I hope I will catch
  Now that we here, I'm ready to leave
  The whole wide world behind

  Now in the twilight of the psychedelic years
  Roll back the highlights til' the dancer disappears, til' the dancer disappears
