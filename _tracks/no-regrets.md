track-lyrics: "i know your leavin's too long over due\nfor far too long i've had nothing new to show to you\ngoodbye dry eyes i watched your plane fade off west of the moon\nit felt so strange to walk away alone\n\nno regrets\nno tears goodbye\ndon't want you back\nwe'd only cry again\nsay goodbye again\n\nthe hours that were yours echo like empty rooms\nthoughts we used to share i now keep alone\ni woke last night and spoke to you\nnot thinkin' you were gone\nit felt so strange to lie awake alone\n\nno regrets\nno tears goodbye\ndon't want you back\nwe'd only cry again\nsay goodbye again\n\nour freinds have tried to turn my nights to day\nstrange faces in your place can't keep the ghosts away\njust beyond the darkest hour, just behind the door\nit feels so strange to lead my life alone\n\nno regrets\nno tears goodbye\ndon't want you back\nwe'd only cry again\nsay goodbye again"
