    It's true
    You're lazy
    You're tired
    And crazy
    And you know there's something more
    But you can't give it a name
    Someone's selling all your heroes
    And they seem so tame

    You heard it all before
    And said your case was tragic
    You heard it all before
    And now they say it's magic

    You need
    Time off
    For good
    Behaviour
    And you know there's something else
    But you can't give a name
    Someone's selling all your heroes
    And it seems such a shame

    You heard it all before
    You said your case was tragic
    You heard it all before
    And now they say it's magic

    You heard it all before
    They said your case was tragic
    You heard it all before
    And now they say it's magic
