"Memphis" was actually written by actress Karen Black, for the Robert Altman film "Nashville"

She played a second-tier singer destined to serve as perpetual stand-in for emotionally fragile superstar Barbara Jean, another icon who is accidentally assassinated at a political rally at the movie's end. 

"Memphis" was generally considered an egregiously bad song written by an amateur whose dislike for country music was evident from the song's sappiness. At the time it was generally thought that Altman let it into the film as an indulgence to Karen Black.
