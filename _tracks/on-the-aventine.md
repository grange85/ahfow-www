track-lyrics: "Cheap champagne instead of rain\nA saffron dream come what will\nThe birds that sing in the middle of the night\nWhile the roses bloom on the hill\nPeace within and traffic's outside\nThe markets are closed\nThe day we sing in the middle of the night\nWhile the roses bloom\nA lightning storm to keep you warm\nYellow light standing still\nOn the Aventine\nOn the Aventine Hill"
