I'm really sorry if you've reached this page it's because Everything's Swirling, The Galaxie 500 30th birthday fanzine has sold out. My lack of trust in Paypal's auditing means there might actually be a few copies which I'll put online later (I didn't want to risk selling more copies than I had!). If more copies do become available I'll post in all the usual places (here, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram).

Sorry again, and thanks for your interest.

Andy
