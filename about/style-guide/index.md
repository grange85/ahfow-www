This isn't meant to scare folk off but - my editing is pretty light touch but this is a rough outline of how to write for the site. If you fancy writing anything for A Head Full of Wishes I am [always open for business](/about/).

A Head Full of Wishes
: The site's full name is _A Head Full of Wishes_ (note it has an _A_ and a lower-case _o_ in of) and in abbreviated form _AHFoW_ - either is acceptable but using the long form more than once in an article is probably overkill.

Punctuation
: Ellipsis - no space before&hellip; but a space after.
: Try not to over-use exclaimation marks (I know that I'm a serial abuser of this rule)
: Dashes should be en dashes (but generally aren't)

Dates
: For full date _[ordinal_number] [full month name] [full year]_ no commas. So, 17th May 1964 or 1st January 2000 - in filenames use yyyy-mm-dd so 1964-05-17 or 2000-01-01

& or and
: Always _and_ unless Damon & Naomi or Dean & Britta

Damon & Naomi
: Always with an ampersand when talking about the band, if talking about the members then use _and_ so: _Damon & Naomi played a show_ but _Damon and Naomi hung around afterwards to sign things_

Dean & Britta
: Always with an ampersand when talking about the band, if talking about the members then use _and_ so: _Dean & Britta have a new single_ but _Dean and Britta are always friendly_

Britta Phillps and Dean Wareham
: Treat as two individuals rather than a band so always _and_ not _&_


British English vs American English spelling
: *Always* use British English spelling so _rumour_ not _rumor_ and _analogue_ not _analog_ except when they are used in titles, so: _released on analogue formats_ but _The New Analog_

Bands *are* bands!
: When talking about bands use the plural form so Luna _are_ a band and Galaxie 500 _are_ a band

### Capitalization of song titles
This site uses the [Musicbrainz styles](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style/Language/English) for song and album titles.

* Always capitalize the first and last word of a title. This rule should be followed even if the words would normally be lowercase according to the other rules. If a title is broken up by major punctuation (colon according to subtitle style, question mark, exclamation mark, em-dash, parentheses, or quotes), capitalize each distinct piece of the title as if it were a distinct title. Therefore, for example, always capitalize the first and last words of each section.
* Between the first and last word of a title Capitalize all words except:
  * Articles: a, an, the
  * Coordinate conjunctions: and, but, or, nor
  * Short prepositions (three letters or less): as, at, by, for, in, of, on, to, but, cum, mid, off, per, qua, re, up, via -- except when used as adverbs or as an inseparable part of a verb (as in "Plug In Baby" or "Shine On You Crazy Diamond").
  * When used to form an infinitive: to
* In compounds formed by hyphens, capitalize each part exactly as if they were a separate word.
* Capitalize contractions and slang consistent with the rules above to the extent that such clearly apply. For example, do not capitalize o' for "of", 'n' or n' for "and".

In addition to the MB rules:
* In song titles and is always _and_ and not an _&_
* Song titles not in English use the style of that language so, _La poupée qui fait non_
