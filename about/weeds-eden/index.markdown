<p>Consider this a cursory thrown together collection of things I know (and have) about The Weeds of Eden - mostly based on a half-arsed skim through the AHFoW mailing list.</p>
<p>There are at least two other bands called The Weeds of Eden - so watch your step before you find yourself google-ing your way into a whole new world!</p>
<p>Earliest mention I have is 1999 - there was a virtually unreadable website in 2001 (sadly the Wayback Machine doesn't have evidence) - which had a few MP3s and talk of an EP - not sure if anything physical materialised but you'll find the four tracks below:</p>
<p>Described by David Voight in a post to the mailing list in July 1999 as:</p>
<blockquote><p>for the cats that are interested:  the weeds of eden is a powder trio that will kick anyone's ass into the cock pop multiverse.  this groop features two members of Luna:  Sean "dick" Eden and Lee "ghost" Wall.  There is also a third member that shall be discussed at a later date.</p></blockquote>

  <p>They played a few shows in NYC in August 2006 (with Elk City) - some pictures exist (thanks to Don Clark) that suggest that by 2006 they were more than a "powder trio":</p>
<p>David on the mailing list described the show:</p>
<blockquote><p>Week 2 of the Weeds of Eden/Elk City residency at Pianos.....another super enjoyable evening.  Elk City opened and was strong.  Weeds followed with a wonderful set....same 8 songs as last week with the order jumbled.  Dave joined them for the middle 4 songs....including a beautiful rendition of Still at Home.  And the closing pair of songs....Radiate and Saturdaze....were just extraordinary.</p></blockquote>
