This was the second of two limited run DVDs of live shows that Damon & Naomi released, this one was recorded over two nights in Tokyo in January 2008 with Michio Kurihara on guitar, Helene Espvall on cello and Bhob Rainey on sax.

It's a lovely performance shot with a couple of static cameras and has lots of nice long, lingering shots, although not always lingering where you might want it to be, most notably during Kurihara's fabulous guitar freak-out during _This Car..._ which has Naomi in the way at the beginning of it, and that would generally be no hardship, but the freak-out is so unexpected that it seems a shame we don't see the beginning of it. It does later cut to the other camera so we don't miss it all!

There's an eight minute clip of _Stars Never Fade_ from the DVD on YouTube that is pretty special too - with Kurihara and Helena Espvall duelling instruments

I love live albums, many of my favourite albums of all time are live ones, and I do like live video clips that turn up on YouTube - but full live concert videos for some reason don't work - this is lovely as a record of a show
