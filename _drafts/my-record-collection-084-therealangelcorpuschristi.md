Unlike Angel Corpus Christi's [lovely Luna tribute album]() I don't have to bend the rules to include _therealangelcorpuschristi_ since Dean plays guitar (and Britta bass) on the cover of The Velvet Underground's Femme Fatale.

_therealangelcorpuschristi_ is a compilation album pulling splendid contributions from across Angel's body of work
