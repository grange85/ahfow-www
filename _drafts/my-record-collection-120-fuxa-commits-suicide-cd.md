So space-rock supremo(s) Fuxa put in their second appearance, and they will be back at least a couple more times before the end of the series. This time on an EP of Suicide covers that contains a Richard Formby remix of Cheree that Dean sings on.

{% ahfowimage "url" "caption" %}

Cheree is over 10 minutes long, the EP also includes a "radio edit" - but, given that even that is over six minutes long I suspect it didn't find itself on too many radio playlists! Which is a shame because it is rather great.
