Illumination was the second album by The Pastels that Dean guested on - the sleeve notes aren't kind enough to tell who appeared on what track so I guess you have to listen closely! For some reason I've shared _Rough Riders_ when I've written about this before - I must have known that from somewhere?

Illumination is a fantastic album that I don't listen to enough ... maybe my favourie album by The Pastels (and not just because Dean's on it).

There's a lovely pic of all the album's collaborators which lived on Jonathan Kilgour's near-official website back in the day!
