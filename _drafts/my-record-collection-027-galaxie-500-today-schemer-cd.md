So, Galaxie 500's Today puts in it's second appearance in this series in the form of the release on Dutch/German label Schemer. For some reason the first European releases of Today were on Schemer, for the CD, and Shimmy Disc Europe for the LP.

This was the first CD release of the album and also the first appearance anywhere of _bonus track_ Crazy - and its only outing anywhere until it turned up on the _Uncollected_ disc in the box set in 1996. The Rough Trade reissue CD editions of Today did have an extra track but it was always the b-side of their first single, _King of Spain_.

The Schemer logo is oversized and ugly, and rather ruins the album's minimalist aesthetic, being carelessly dumped on the back of the sleeve, and on the very _undesigned_ disc itself.

This was another _fill out the collection_ purchase in 2012 - bought on eBay.
