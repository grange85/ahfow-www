So Dean Wareham's first LP puts in it's third, and (I think) final, appearance in this series with this test pressing that Nat kindly sent me ahead of release. Since in the previous posts I've mostly whined on about formats maybe it's about time to talk a little more about the music.

**Love Is Colder Than Death**
Named after Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first feature film... which [is on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW_5KheEG_c) and I started to watch but it was slow, and grubby and over stylised and derivative of the French New Wave from years earlier. We went and saw his much better The Marriage of Maria Braun at the NFT a few years ago and Hanna Schygulla introduced it.

**Emancipated Hearts**
This has an odd middle section where Dean drifts into Little Drummer Boy so I guess, this makes it a Christmas song.

**The Deadliest Day Since the Invasion Began**


**The Longest Bridges in the World**

**The Ticking is the Bomb**

**Air**
