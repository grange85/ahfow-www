Damon & Naomi's beautiful first album came used Man Ray's _Glass Tears_ on the front cover which just makes the album even more beautiful - also Macioce's pics on the back cover mirroring somewhat Man Ray's photo, are also perfect.

Interestingly while researching this post I found that in 2015 The Getty Museum described the photo like this:

> The face, however, belongs not to a real woman but to a fashion mannequin who cries tears of glistening, round glass beads; the effect is to aestheticize the sentiment her tears would normally express.

[Larmes (Tears), J. Paul Getty Museum (Internet Archive - archived 2015)](https://web.archive.org/web/20150301205145/http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/37756/man-ray-larmes-tears-american-1930-1932)

... and this claim is repeated all over the place ... but ... look at the photo, [look at it closely](https://www.manray.net/images/gallery/glass-tears.jpg) - there is no way that this is not a "real woman" this is clearly nonsense? By 2018 Getty updated their site and changed the words 

> The face belongs to a fashion model who cries tears of glistening, round glass beads; the effect is to aestheticize the sentiment her tears would normally express.

But by then it was too late and the nonsense was [sprinkled](https://sundayguardianlive.com/art/9513-making-it-visible-known-how-man-ray-realised-his-photography-dreams) all [over](https://www.manray.net/glass-tears.jsp#prettyPhoto) the [internet](https://p2602891.our.dmu.ac.uk/2020/11/05/man-ray-glass-tears/) and [treated](https://www.flickr.com/photos/greatestpaka/5169456855) as [fact](https://artclasscurator.com/artwork-of-the-week-man-ray-tears/)! This is so frustrating but, as someone who has been responsible for [sprinking misinformation around the internet](/2011/06/20/mp3-victory-garden-enough-or-adolf/) I can't really complain too much!

Anyway ... back to the album, and inside that perfect sleeve is a wonderful album - now while I might have suggested that [With Ghost]() is my fave D&N album and I'll stand by that (for now), More Sad Hits has a more emotional effect on me. The songs get deeper into me - maybe this is because of the post-Galaxie 500 relief - I listened to this album a lot when it came out, and still do now... and still hear things in different ways - e.g. being completely freaked out by the end of Astrafiammante at 3am while trying to manage a bout of insomnia.

Macioce posted some out-takes from the photo session on his [wonderful Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsJu9YVuW4r/?img_index=1) that includes this adorable, smiley photo!
