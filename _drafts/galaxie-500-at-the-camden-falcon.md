Thirty six years ago this week Galaxie 500 were on a tour of the UK supporting The Sundays that started in Newcastle on the 1st February and then worked a number of cities around the country with the tour scheduled to end on the 11th February at The Town and Country Club in London.

On the 3rd of Feb they were at the Leadmill in Sheffield and some pics from that show were shared with me last year:
