A couple of days ago I casually threw into [a social media post](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3zd24yzhk54uxdb53wvfjidu/post/3ldhiz33c2225) that around now was the 30th birthday of this website. I had intended (like I always do) some sort of grand celebration, but (like it always does) it turned into a hastily rattled out blog post. Welcome to that post!

{% ahfowimage "url" "caption" %}

To make this even more hgalf-arsed than that I'll point you towards the posts I made for AHFoW's 20th birthday... and then bolt a bit more on here. So, for the site's 20th I broke down my celebration into "20 bite-sized chunks" spread over four posts - so, start there...

 - [Happy 20th birthday to A Head Full of Wishes - #1](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2014/12/04/happy-20th-birthday-head-full-wishes-1/)
 - [Happy 20th birthday to A Head Full of Wishes - #2](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2014/12/07/happy-20th-birthday-head-full-wishes-2/)
 - [Happy 20th birthday to A Head Full of Wishes - #3](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2014/12/10/happy-20th-birthday-head-full-wishes-3/)
 - [Happy 20th birthday to A Head Full of Wishes - #4](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2014/12/13/happy-20th-birthday-head-full-wishes-4/)

and now... ten more to get us up to 30:

### 21: Fanzines and tribute albums
Over the last few years AHFoW entered the physical realm with a series of fanzines, and tribute albums

### 22: Terrascopaedia #11
In 2019 Phil McMullen asked me if I'd like to have a piece in his lovely letterpressed magazine "Terrascopaedia" so I pitched an interview with former Galaxie 500 members about how to keep Galaxie 500 a going concern even when it wasn't a _going concern_. Dean, Damon & Naomi were all happy to answer my questions and Phil did a fine job of wrangling my attempt into something others would like to read and it was published in issue 13.

Here is a [PDF of the final interview](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/docs/galaxie-500-terrascopaedia-13.pdf) you can also read my _unplugged_ interviews

### 23: It's all about me
 - [Poetic Justice](https://poeticjusticemagazine.com) online magazine asked me to pick my 10 favourite Galaxie 500 songs... [so I did and explaied why](https://poeticjusticemagazine.com/2022/10/04/a-head-full-of-wishes-top-10-galaxie-500-songs/)
 - [It's Psychedelic Baby interviewed me](https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2017/12/an-interview-with-andy-aldridge.html) about AHFoW and more.

### 24: Heading north
I moved from London to Whitley Bay in the North East of England and saw Dean on my doorstep not long afterwards

### 25: We all got older
From 1995 until 2020 I ran a survey every Christmas but interest seemed to wane (half as many people voted in 2020 compared to 2018) so I finally gave it the axe. In the final survey I posted a graphic that might explain why!

In 1999 Bob was the first of us who edged into the "over 50" category - in 2020 44% of us were over 50 - maybe old folk just don't like doing surveys!

### 26: Every cloud...
COVID happened... and we were all stuck at home for ages, some of us getting periodically sick, the rest getting tired of it all - but the silver lining was that Dean & Britta, initially with trepidation, but then later fully embraced, live streamed concerts from their living room. It was lovely to spend real time with them, and with other fans around the world. 

Here's [a playlist of clips from those shows](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVUlJ8-T7PGaHT7kFoKYnihyXtiugNoh-) (or rehearsals, or promos for those shows).

Also, always a joy watching them trying to switch off at the end of the show!
