A couple of days ago I casually threw into [a social media post](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3zd24yzhk54uxdb53wvfjidu/post/3ldhiz33c2225) that around now was the 30th birthday of this website. I had intended (like I always do) some sort of grand celebration, but (like it always does) it turned into a hastily rattled out blog post. Welcome to that post!

{% ahfowimage "url" "caption" %}

To make this even more hgalf-arsed than that I'll point you towards the posts I made for AHFoW's 20th birthday... and then bolt a bit more on here. So, for the site's 20th I broke down my celebration into "20 bite-sized chunks" spread over four posts - so, start there...

 - [Happy 20th birthday to A Head Full of Wishes - #1](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2014/12/04/happy-20th-birthday-head-full-wishes-1/)

and now... ten more to get us up to 30:

### 21: Fanzines and tribute albums
Over the last few years AHFoW entered the physical realm with a series of fanzines, and tribute albums

### 22: Terrascopaedia #11
In 2019 Phil McMullen asked me if I'd like to have a piece in his lovely letterpressed magazine "Terrascopaedia" so I pitched an interview with former Galaxie 500 members about how to keep Galaxie 500 a going concern even when it wasn't a _going concern_. Dean, Damon & Naomi were all happy to answer my questions and Phil did a fine job of wrangling my attempt into something others would like to read and it was published in issue 13.
