Dean and Britta's live streams 2020

I started this post as a history of Dean & Britta's live streamed shows during those awful and frightnening times five years ago, but the more I jotted down notes I found it was more about _me and Dean & Britta's live streamed shows_ so apologies as this is turning into a more personal story of how I, and my family, made it through 2020, and how important Dean and Britta's appearances over the course of the year became - not just for the music, but for the opportunity to engage with them and other fans over our shared, but quite varied experiences of dealing with COVID. I'd love to hear your experiences so, please leave a comment.

The beginning of 2020 seemed to be quite normal, we'd heard about this virus but didn't see how it would or could reach us. We'd been through these _scares_ before, and this was surelyy just more media tricks to sell papers, and get clicks. Adam, our son, had been unemployed for a while but in March was offered a job as a customer service assistant for Network Rail at Charing Cross station. Before the pandemic Charing Cross was the [15th busiest station in the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_railway_stations_in_Great_Britain_(2019%E2%80%9320)) - his first day at work was the 23rd March. On the morning of that day the UK prime minister announced a "stay at home order effective immediately" ... Adam started work at Charing Cross station as a customer service assistant on the very day that there stopped being customers to assist! As it was important to keep public transport open and running to ensure that essential workers could make it to work Adam went to work that day, and worked through the entire lockdown. On that first day Hazel and I were terrified for him... "you don't have to go" - but he went. Over the weeks the initial fear we had for him turned to jealousy - he was seeing London the way we had never, and would never see it!

My job at the time was the Webmaster at The National Archives (TNA) and, since it was very much an on-line role, and since TNA already allowed occasional working from home, the transition from being an office worker to a home worker was pretty smooth - we had the tech in place and most of the time it was working. We reacted quickly enabling free online access to resources that were normally only available on-site and ensuring that the web site was capable of coping with the increased use.

In April Dean was scheduled to tour the UK but these shows got cancelled and were rescheduled for January 2021 (and subsequently postponed again, eventually happening in October) - my life has very rarely gone that length of time without seeing Dean since my first time in 1990. It seems very selfish with the world going through this nightmare to whine about not seeing a band you love, but... music, and the connections made through music, were one of the things that were important, these were the things that we needed to try and live a halfway normal life through a completely abnormal time.

On the 25th April Dean and Britta played Tugboat and Moon Palace, live on Instagram, the first of a number of ad-hoc live appearances on social media platforms - sadly the time difference between Dean and Britta's Echo Park home and mine in London meant that I very rarely was lucky enough to catch these live. Los Angeles was in the midst of a heatwave, and Dean played the set topless. It was also the first opportunity we had to see that Dean was going down the route that many of us did in those early days of COVID of growing out some facial hair.

These little add-hoc performances were of course a treat, but never exxperiencing them live was a little heartbreaking, every morning before a daily Zoom meeting I'd scour Dean and Britta's _socials_ to see if they'd got up to anything while I slept.

At the beginning of May the duo agreed to do a full live show as a benefit for the proposed [Rental Affordability Act](https://web.archive.org/web/20200520033831/https://www.rentcontrolnow.org/) an effort to limit rent increases in California (the proposal was defeated in the November 2020 ballot). While they had seemed happy to do the little ad-hoc streams playing one or two shows, they had never intended to do a full live stream:

> I didn’t want to do it at first, but then we were asked to do a benefit — for rent control in Los Angeles — which is a good cause. We did that, and it was a challenge, but also it was fun connecting with people.

This did seem like a one off event though, and things went back to the ad-hoc social media events, and then Dean's newsletter arrived announcing that they would be playing a full show from their living room:

<blockquote>
Next Saturday evening May 30 at 9pm EST, 6PM PDT. Britta and I are going to do another stripped-down performance from our living room. After researching the many platforms out there (Facebook, Youtube, Stageit, Instagram) we have decided on a new site called VEEPS that seems to offer a high-quality experience and you don't have to be on Facebook or watch Youtube ads. If you are in Europe and fast asleep, you can watch the show when you wake up; the link will remain active for a week. And for those of you down under, 6pm PDT means some time Sunday morning, depending on your time zone.

6pm PDT is 2am during a British summer, and while as Dean said in the newsletter - "if you are in Europe and fast asleep, you can watch the show when you wake up" there was no way that I'd miss the chance of watching the show live - and it was a Saturday/Sunday, so not on a _school night_ so... I got dressed up, _no, really...I did_ and sat in front of my computer, tweeting, posting to Facebook and Instagram, and waited until the early hours of the morning... and then...

Britta: "Thanks for coming over"

Dean and Britta then talked a little bit about the current situation and then opened the show with a cover of The Clash's _I'm So Bored With The USA_ which segued into The Carnival is Over that they had recently released as lathe cut single. The show was a lovely mix of songs spanning Dean's career (and Britta's cover of Drive), and Dean threw in a couple of poems (Edward Lear's The Jumblies, and Bertolt Brecht's On Thinking About Hell). The show finished afer 3am with a cover of The Bee Gees' Massachusetts... I crawled off to bed - happy.

It's strange listening back to the show now, hearing Dean and Britta talking about the time, in the opening intro Dean mentions that "here in Southern California [...] they say that things are getting back to normal" which turns out to be nonsense of course, we had had similar teases in the UK, but things were far from normal and wouldn't be for a long time... and I'd say even if we have arrived at normal by now, it's a very different normal than pre-COVID.

At the beginning of June there was a 60 second Instagram story video that showed Britta sitting on their veranda/balcony with her bass on her lap while Dean, off camera, started playing the opening of Bowie's Rebel Rebel before launching into Galaxie 500's Strange... but then it ended... these little teases were sometimes - just not enough!

On the 14th June they performed a couple of songs for a "Silver Studio Session" for the Andy Warhol Museum, playing The Velvet Underground's Ride Into The Sun, and The Incredible String Band's Air, and the next week they appeared on another benefit show, this time playing Massachusetts as part of a five hour benefit live stream in aid of the London pub The Betsy Trotwood. Both of these were pre-recorded (and presented in black and white).

The two of them were obviously happy enough with the 30th May show that they scheduled another for the 27th June - this was picthed as Dean & Britta performing Luna:

<blockquote>
This time we are playing Luna songs exclusively. Sean & Lee can't be there but will share in the proceeds.

They trailled beforehand with some noodling that turned into the first airing of their cover of Donovan's Sadness on Instagram Live (so not a Luna song). The show was again scheduled for the early hours of a UK morning and once again I stayed up. The show was preceded by Sean playing Broken Chair on Luna's Instagram (the song also put in an appearance during the main set with Britta taking Sean's vocal). Dean & Britta were a lot more comfortable and relaxed - someone was also punching in some crowd sound effects.
