Dean and Britta's live streams 2020

I started this post as a history of Dean & Britta's live streamed shows during those awful and frightnening times five years ago, but the more I jotted down notes I found it was more about _me and Dean & Britta's live streamed shows_ so apologies as this is turning into a more personal story of how I, and my family, made it through 2020, and how important Dean and Britta's appearances over the course of the year became - not just for the music, but for the opportunity to engage with them and other fans over our shared, but quite varied experiences of dealing with COVID. I'd love to hear your experiences so, please leave a comment.

The beginning of 2020 seemed to be quite normal, we'd heard about this virus but didn't see how it would or could reach us. We'd been through these _scares_ before, and this was surely just more media tricks to sell papers, and get clicks. Adam, our son, had been unemployed for a while but in March was offered a job as a customer service assistant for Network Rail at Charing Cross station. Before the pandemic Charing Cross was the [15th busiest station in the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_railway_stations_in_Great_Britain_(2019%E2%80%9320)) - his first day at work was the 23rd March. On the morning of that day the UK prime minister announced a "stay at home order effective immediately" ... Adam started work at Charing Cross station as a customer service assistant on the very day that there stopped being customers to assist! As it was important to keep public transport open and running to ensure that essential workers could make it to work Adam went to work that day, and worked through the entire lockdown. On that first day Hazel and I were terrified for him... "you don't have to go" - but he went. Over the weeks the initial fear we had for him turned to jealousy - he was seeing London the way we had never, and would never see it!

There's a phrase we use in the UK where we would describe something or somewhere that's really, really busy as _being like Piccadilly Circus_ - this is Adam's picture of Piccadilly Circus in April 2020:

My job at the time was the Webmaster at The National Archives (TNA) and, since it was very much an on-line role, and since TNA already allowed occasional working from home, the transition from being an office worker to a home worker was pretty smooth - we had the tech in place and most of the time it was working. We reacted quickly enabling free online access to resources that were normally only available on-site and ensuring that the web site was capable of coping with the increased use. My job hardly changed, just the office and how I communicated with my colleagues. Hazel worked for The British Library at the time and her transition was less smooth - but we managed to get on with our work.

The _daily walk_ became a thing. We were lucky that we lived near to The Grand Union Canal, and had plenty of green space around us. Every day we'd head out and walk along the canal, the daily walk, despite the stress of other people, was a very important part of our daily lives. We got into the habit of it, and it's a habit we never got out of.

In April Dean Wareham was scheduled to tour the UK but these shows got cancelled and were rescheduled for January 2021 (and subsequently postponed again, eventually happening in October 2021) - my life has very rarely gone that length of time without seeing Dean since my first time in 1990. It seems very selfish with the world going through this nightmare to whine about not seeing a band you love, but... music, and the connections made through music, were one of the things that were important, these were the things that we needed to try and live a halfway normal life through a completely abnormal time.

On the 25th April Dean and Britta played {% ahfowtrack "Tugboat" %} and {% ahfowtrack "Moon Palace" %}, live on Instagram, the first of a number of ad-hoc live appearances on social media platforms - sadly the time difference between Dean and Britta's Echo Park home and mine in London meant that I very rarely was lucky enough to catch these live. Los Angeles was in the midst of a heatwave, and Dean played the set topless. It was also the first opportunity we had to see that Dean was going down the route that many of us did in those early days of COVID of growing out some facial hair.

These little add-hoc performances were of course a treat, but never experiencing them live was a little heartbreaking, every morning before a daily work Zoom meeting I'd scour Dean and Britta's _socials_ to see if they'd got up to anything while I slept.

At the beginning of May the duo agreed to do a full live show as a benefit for the proposed [Rental Affordability Act](https://web.archive.org/web/20200520033831/https://www.rentcontrolnow.org/) an effort to limit rent increases in California (the proposal was defeated in the November 2020 ballot). While they had seemed happy to do the little ad-hoc streams playing one or two shows, they had never intended to do a full live stream:

<blockquote>
I didn't want to do it at first, but then we were asked to do a benefit — for rent control in Los Angeles — which is a good cause. We did that, and it was a challenge, but also it was fun connecting with people.
</blockquote>

The show was at 7pm Los Angeles time, that is 3am during a British summer... in the early hours of a Friday morning... on a work night. But, this was during the times of COVID, no one needed to know how tired I looked at work the next day? And, who'd notice if I had an early-afternoon meeting with my pillow? I stayed up.

The show was wonderful, sounded great, the sun in the room caused exposure problems with the video but in retrospect looks better for that - although seeing the shadow of the camera on Dean's forehead was quite funny.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/live-stream-article/2020-05-14-camera-shadow.jpg" "Camera shadow" %}

They opened the show with {% ahfowtrack "Tugboat " %}and played a lovely balanced mix of Galaxie 500, Luna and Dean & Britta songs and threw in a new cover of The Bee Gees' {% ahfowtrack "Massachusets" %}. Their cover of The Rutles' {% ahfowtrack "Cheese and Onions" %}, was a particular high - mainly thanks to Britta's backing vocals. But the whole show was wonderful and it was great seeing them seemingly fit and healthy and getting on with their life as well as any of us were managing. They finished with a cover of Joy Division's {% ahfowtrack "Ceremony" %} that someone had requested... shouted out for it in YouTube chat!

Dean explained at the end that Britta had engineered the whole shebang and she replied "I wanted to learn it because we'll probably be doing more of this because... we can't go anywhere".

Just afer 4am I slipped into bed and slept for a couple of hours before work, I don't think Hazel noticed me coming to bed but she did look at me next morning with _you're-such-a-sad-sack_ eyes.

The following week Dean's newsletter arrived announcing that they would be playing another full show from their living room:

<blockquote>
Next Saturday evening May 30 at 9pm EST, 6PM PDT. Britta and I are going to do another stripped-down performance from our living room. After researching the many platforms out there (Facebook, Youtube, Stageit, Instagram) we have decided on a new site called VEEPS that seems to offer a high-quality experience and you don't have to be on Facebook or watch Youtube ads. If you are in Europe and fast asleep, you can watch the show when you wake up; the link will remain active for a week. And for those of you down under, 6pm PDT means some time Sunday morning, depending on your time zone.
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Dean Wareham newsletter (25th May 2020)</p>

6pm Los Angeles time is 2am so, once again at an ungodly hour in the UK, and while as Dean said in the newsletter - "if you are in Europe and fast asleep, you can watch the show when you wake up" there was no way that I'd miss the chance of watching the show live - and it was a Saturday/Sunday, so this time not on a _school night_ so... I got dressed up, _no, really...I did_ and sat in front of my computer, tweeting, posting to Facebook and Instagram, and waited until show time... 

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/live-stream-article/2020-05-30-andy-waits.jpg" "Waiting for show time (also COVID facial hair!)" %}

and then...

Britta: "Thanks for coming over"

Dean and Britta talked a little bit about the current situation and then opened the show with a cover of The Clash's _{% ahfowtrack "I'm So Bored With The USA" %}_ which segued into {% ahfowtrack "The Carnival is Over" %}. The show was a lovely mix of songs spanning Dean's career (and Britta's cover of {% ahfowtrack "Drive" %}), and Dean threw in a couple of poems (Edward Lear's The Jumblies, and Bertolt Brecht's On Thinking About Hell). The show finished afer 3am again with their cover of The Bee Gees' {% ahfowtrack "Massachusetts" %}... I crawled off to bed - happy.

I'm listening back to the show now, hearing Dean and Britta talking about the time, in the opening intro Dean mentions that "here in Southern California [...] they say that things are getting back to normal" which turns out to have beeenn nonsense of course, we had had similar teases in the UK, but things were far from normal and wouldn't be for a long time... and I'd say even if we have arrived at normal by now, it's a very different normal than pre-COVID.

The following week Dean & Britta's cover of The Carnival is Over was released as a single, both digitally and as a transparent square, lathe-cut 7" - Dean talked about The Carnival is Over, and The Seekers, for the Möistworks blog:

<blockquote>
In 2008, in Jersey City, Britta and I attempted to record the song. We had gone into the studio to try a few covers, including the Cure's "It's Friday, I'm in Love." We finished the Cure song but gave up on "Carnival"—it was probably in the wrong key for Britta's voice. But when the pandemic hit and the world ground to a halt, the titled popped back into my head and I urged Britta to try singing it again. We opened the old ProTools files and discovered we had the percussion (by Anthony LaMarca), electric 12-string guitar, and a mellotron by Britta—all ready to go. Still, it took Britta more than a couple of attempts to figure out how to sing it. Sometimes when tackling a cover it takes time to get the original singer out of your head and deliver it in your own voice.  Sometimes you have to admit that you and the song are not suited to each other at all. But not this time.
</blockquote>
<p class="caption"><a href="https://moistworks.com/home/carnival">The Carnival is Over by Dean Wareham (Moistworks, 18th June 2020)</a></p>

The song was then sent to Kramer to finish it off - "he came back to me a few days later with a beautiful arrangement and mix".

I ordered two copies of The Carnival is Over - which, with shipping came to an eye watering amount - one for me and one for Andrew which saved a little on the postage. In July I cycled into Hammersmith and sat in a churchyard with Andrew and handed over his copy of the single. One of my pals from work lived by the river in Hammersmith so later I sat with her on the riverside drinking tea and trying to understand the strange world we were living in. These were rare face-to-face encounters with anyone I wasn't related to, and was a joy to see them both.

At the beginning of June there was a 60 second Instagram story video that showed Britta sitting on their veranda/balcony with her bass on her lap while Dean, off camera, started playing the opening of Bowie's Rebel Rebel before launching into Galaxie 500's {% ahfowtrack "Strange" %}... but then it ended... these little teases were just not enough!

On the 14th June they performed a couple of songs for a "Silver Studio Session" for the Andy Warhol Museum, playing The Velvet Underground's {% ahfowtrack "Ride Into The Sun" %}, and The Incredible String Band's {% ahfowtrack "Air" %}, and the next week they appeared on another benefit show, this time playing Massachusetts as part of a five hour benefit live stream in aid of the London pub The Betsy Trotwood. Both of these were pre-recorded (and presented in black and white).

In June the UK Government had started relaxing restrictions so on the 22nd June Hazel and I took a train into the West End to see the city before most of its people returned, I guess it wasn't as quiet as it had been when Adam had started work at the end of March, but it was still a strange and haunting experience

Dean and Britta were obviously happy enough with the 30th May show that they scheduled another for the 27th June - this was picthed as Dean & Britta performing Luna. They trailled the show beforehand with some noodling that turned into the first airing of their cover of Donovan's {% ahfowtrack "Sadness" %} on Instagram Live (so not a Luna song). 

The show was again scheduled for the early hours of a UK morning and once again I stayed up. It was preceded by Sean playing {% ahfowtrack "Broken Chair" %} on Luna's Instagram (the song also put in an appearance during the main set with Britta taking Sean's vocal). 

Another lovely set, this time of Luna classics, a couple more poems, and the show finished with a cover of Mercury Rev's {% ahfowtrack "Car Wash Hair" %} which had become a Luna song a few years before on their A Sentimental Education covers album.

On the 15th July my dad turned 80, he had planned on having a big party (possibly even two big parties, he's a very popular person), but COVID restrictions put paid to that, however a lot of the more stringent restrictions had been lifted and outdoor gatherings were permitted and so my sister decided to arrange a surprise meeting with him, in a park near Arundel. 

Hazel, Adam, and I took the train down and joined the rest of the family near Swanbourne Lake and gave my dad quite a surprise - possibly added to by the ridiculous moustache I had acquired by this time! We had a lovely afternoon wandering around the lake. It was lovely to see so many faces but felt very strange being in such a big group... big was about 10 to 15 people. A few weeks later, when things started going to crap again a new _rule of six_ was introduced that would have put paid to this.

Meanwhile Dean and Britta had announced yet another live streamed show for the end of July, this one being scheduled at a more convenient time for the European fans - "Britta and I have scheduled our next live show – Saturday July 25 at noon Pacific, 3pm EDT, that’s 8pm in the UK and 9pm in Europe. This time we will play a set heavier on Galaxie 500 songs. Hope to see you there!"

For this show Roger Brogan was roped in to help out with drums and tech and an Instagram post before the show gave a little 60 second look behind the scenes of a Dean & Britta live stream:

{% ahfowvideo "C-w-qxlOU-Y" "Behind the scenes" "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/live-stream-article/2025-07-25-britta-soundchecks.jpg" %}

This time the show was subtitled "Leave the Planet" and promised to be a set of "Galaxie 500 and more", however the show didn't start as planned:

<blockquote>
The duo have decided to used the Veeps platform for the concerts which consensus seems to suggest was a wise decision as the sound quality is pretty good although for the first ten minutes of last night’s performance you wouldn’t have known that as the show started without sound. After a couple of minutes of their opener the message that the only people who could hear the show were the three folk in D&B’s living room the event ground to a halt. With some knob twiddling and a call to tech support things were finally resolved and the concert restarted with My Rifle, My Pony and Me from Dean and Cheval Sombre’s album of cowboy songs from a couple of years back.
</blockquote>

This was the first show that offered, for a few extra pennies, a download of the full show, and in this case also meant you finally did get to hear the version of My Rifle, My Pony and Me that previously we had only seen.

In August the living room shows entered the physical realm with the release of The Quarantine Tapes - a lovely, but pricey, set of seven lathe-cut singles with tracks recorded either during their live stream shows, or in their home studio. The overall cost with shipping to the UK rather scared me - and it was… middle of covid and the middle of us trying to sell our house and move. Then I got an email from Dean and he’d noticed I hadn’t bought a box… so sent me one. I honestly get spoiled by these people!

In September the "final shows of the season" were announced - two sets would be played on the 26th of that month, one early for the Europeans, and a later one for everyone else - Dean assured us that the during the shows they would "mostly playing the same songs at both sets, maybe a few variations and a different poem, but not much" and so I didn't need to buy tickets for both, and stay up until the early hours of the morning.

I bought tickets for both, and stayed up until the early hours of the morning.

But... was this really going to be "the last show of the season" ... in the post-show chat I suggested that they should do a Christmas show, and Britta said that they were already thinking about that... so, thankfully "season" meant Autumn, and we'd get a winter show... or two.
