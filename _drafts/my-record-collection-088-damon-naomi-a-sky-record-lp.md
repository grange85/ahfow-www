The album was started before covid, started by Damon & Naomi in their home studio, and then taken to Japan for Michio Kurihara to do his bit. The lyrics were _post pandemic_ and can't help but be heard in that context, and because of that the album reflects a time more than most. 

> We started [it], like, 2018, or early 2019. We intended to finish it in 2020, so it started in the normal world (laughs). And then it just happened to be finished in the middle of this insane world we’re living in now, so it definitely was influenced by it.
