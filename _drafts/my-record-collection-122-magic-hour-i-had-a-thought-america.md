After a crazy run of Magic Hour releases in the first few months of this series this is their first appearance in over six months. This is a black vinyl copy of the last Magic Hour single.

The A side is I Had a Thought and is lifted from their second album _Will They Turn You On or Will They Turn on You_, the B side is a cover of America from Peruvian rock band Traffic Sound's third (self-titled) album from 1970.
