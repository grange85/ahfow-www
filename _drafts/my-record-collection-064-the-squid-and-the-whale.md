Dean & Britta provided the soundtrack for Noah Baumbach's The Squid & The Whale... although the album has only two tracks, plus Dean's cover of Pink Floyd's 'Hey You'.

In fact the one Lou Reed track is longer than all three of their contributions combined. There is more music in the film as Britta revealed on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List back in October 2005:

> We had 8 cues in the movie. The 2 main themes recur 3 times  (each time with a slightly different arrangement), and we did a version of one of the Burt Jansch songs (without vocals) as well as that version of "Love On A Real Train."

'Love on a Real Train is a Tangerine Dream song originally used in 'Risky Business' - the quote above implies that it was Dean & Britta's version
