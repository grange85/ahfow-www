Luna's 'Bobby Peru' was released as the second single off their fourth album "Pup Tent"

"Bobby Peru" is the character played by Willem Defoe in David Lynch's Wild at Heart, a film I haven't seen for 25+ years - I should probably rectify that but to be honest, as I get older my tolerance of Lynch has been deteriorating - I think his films suit a younger persons brain? Except maybe Mullholland Drive? There was a time I loved his oddness - I loved Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart, waited obsessively for each new episode of Twin Peaks and even had two different box sets of it. Then I started to rewatch it a few years back and gave up on it halfway through the first season.

I have no memory of the character of Bobby Peru so can't even begin to think how he would have handled things and what clever things _he_ would have said.

However... lovely Laura Dern! So I can include this pic of Dean with Laura from Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story

I suspect I bought this seven inch on release - it may even have been an early instance of me buying more than one format on release.
