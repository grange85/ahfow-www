I have surprisinly few bootleg cassettes. I have the ones I've made (a couple of which will turn up later) but not so many others. This is a Luna show from the Fox Theatre in Boulder, CO in 2000 and ... I've no idea how it came into my possesion.

During my metal phase I had literally hundreds of bootleg cassettes - mostly bought at markets around London, often recordings of gigs I was at that normally hit the markets the weekend after the show. Sadly all of those went AWOL in a move (something else I keep dreaming will turn up again).

But by the time I became a Galaxie 500 fan I'd stopped that. Maybe because I just didn't go to where they were being sold any more. I also think I digitised and ditched a lot of the ones I did acquire over time so there are very few cassettes in my collection, so the ones that are are a bit of a mystery. Why do I have this? Why did I keep it? It's a fair audience recording from Britta's
