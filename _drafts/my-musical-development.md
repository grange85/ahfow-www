OK, so this post will be starting a wee bit (or possibly quite far) off topic - although by its very definition it will hopefully end up _on topic_. I have already posted about how I arrived at this point starting in 1989 and being given a cassette of Galaxie 500, but that wasn't really the start of things. Music has been a constant in my life but has always moved on, sometimes perhaps by evolutionary changes, and in a couple of instances by revolutionary ones. So I thought I might look at how music has moved through my life and how my life has been moved by music.

The reason I've started this post is because I started wondering how much more can I write about Galaxie 500 and the bands that developed from it (to be honest I'm surprised at how much I can witter on about them... although I suspect my family isn't! I suspect however that I'll be repeating myself before long... actually I probably already have, and in this post certainly will!

So consider this also a call to arms, if you feel you fancy writing for A Head Full of Wishes on pretty much anything related to Galaxie 500 etc. please [get in touch]().

The two posts related to this are:

In this post I will touch on both of those, but this is going to be more about the lead up to that moment in 1989.

There was always music, lots of music. We had boxes and boxes of singles, most not even in sleeves, and as many albums. The upstairs ceiling of my childhood home was literally bowed down by the weight of LPs, singles, and 78s. The 45s were mostly 60s pop, although not all, and plenty of oddities could be found... and also so many duplicates. We had a record player, and two or three gramophones to play 78s, and a cylinder gramophone that would be dug out occasionally - although the horn was missing so we had to make one from card which wasn't very effective.

Of course my memories only really kick in in the early 70s, so The Beatles were already a big point of my life, of all of our lives. But there were other records I remember as key from those days. The 78s were mostly swing and crooners, but there were a few rock and roll gems that would get played repeatedly - I remember some Bill Haley, and Move it by Cliff and The Drifters... and also this one.

Jim Dale was the bloke from the [Carry On films]() and not a pop (or rock) star so this was a novelty, but also a gem. Pre-Beatles British rock and roll was (and still is) an important touch point for me. British Rock and Roll is often sneered at, maybe because it was more conventional, more acceptable, but Cliff, Joe Brown, Marty Wilde, and (especially) Billy Fury were alongside The Beatles at the heart of my growing up.
