Luna were dropped by Elektra on the eve of the release of The Days of Our Nights so it's US release happened months after the UK/EU release on Beggars. This is the CD that finally made it out in the US on Jericho Reocrds in October of 1999.

The Jericho CD came in that (mostly) annoying occasional CD addition - the slip case. The Days of Our Nights slip case added very little to what it was slipped over. Maybe a few millimeters more on the left of "Horizontal Blonde". The picture on the back was a different shot from the same photo session as the one inside - Lee and Justin have swapped places - neither of these is the same as the one used on the Beggars Banquet release (and on the [recent LP release]()).

I think this release might be the first to have a link to Luna's website fuzzywuzzy.com, the Beggars release didn't. Fuzzywuzzy was subseuqently flogged off and now redirects to fluffywuffy.com from where you can buy fluffy boots. The Beggars release did have a link to beggars.com ... which is at least still owned by them.
