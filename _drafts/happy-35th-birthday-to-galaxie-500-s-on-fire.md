Today&dagger; is the 35th anniversary of the release of Galaxie 500's masterpiece 2nd album On Fire. If you've been reading this blog for ten years you may recognise most of this post from the LP's 25th birthday!

<blockquote><p>If a Pyrrhic victory means triumph won at such cost you may as well have lost, then Galaxie 500's music is the exact opposite: a statement of defeat that resounds like a glorious triumph</p>

<p>Here are some quotes lifted from the thoroughly brilliant "Temperature's Rising: Galaxie 500 an oral and visual history" by Mike McGonigal...</p>
<blockquote><p>We made that record so easily! I'm not even sure there were any second takes. It's one of the easiest records I ever made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Kramer</p>
<blockquote><p>Making On Fire was a very happy experience. I think we were at a point where we were accomplished enough musicians that we were able to play what we had in our head. There was a generally optimistic feeling about the direction of the band and we were getting attention from the critics. It was a lot of fun and the possibilities seemed endless, something that I feel I was very lucky to experience. A very joyful, youthful moment.</p>

<blockquote><p>
On Fire inhabits an awesome, distorted reality. The band, ostensibly a trio of guitar, bass and drums, sound more like a sun carriage. Damon Krukowski’s cymbals and Dean Wareham’s falsetto become lead instruments. Naomi Yang doesn’t so much play as paint with her bass. These abstract tones and spots of primary colour are the sound of three people locked somewhere in a beautiful space, the midpoint between telepathy and propulsion. From the languorous opening bars of ‘Blue Thunder’ to the euphoric closing refrain of “What a pity, what a pity” the record moves back and forward allowing waves of electricity to swell and break across its ten tracks. Few songs have been more appropriately titled than ‘Snowstorm’ and few bands have been in such graceful control of a maelstrom. Has anyone played a wah-wah with such equine grace as Dean Wareham? Each note in the solo crystallizing the reverie of a snowflake hitting the ground.</p>

## &dagger; Why today?
I haven't figured out exactly when Galaxie 500's On Fire was released but I think 23rd of October is the most likely date - I came up with it becuase...

- Simon Reynolds review of the album was in the 28 October edition of Melody Maker
- MM always came out the Wednesday before the date on the cover which would have been 25 October
- Records in the UK were released on the Monday and you'd want the record to be in the shops when folk opened their MM on Wednesday - so On Fire must have been released on the 23 October

A US press release dating from August 1989 when Galaxie 500 signed to Rough Trade, suggests the album would be released on 20 October, but as that's a Friday I'll dismiss it.

Records in the US are apparently released on a Tuesday - so US release date was possibly the 24 October... so we can party tomorrow as well!

There is also an early press release that suggests it was to be released on the 16th October - but I reckon all the above suggests it was pushed back a week!

Feel free to correct me if you think I'm wrong.
