Lovely release on the always wonderful UK indie Great Pop Supplement, released in 2010 it contains two tracks from Dean & Britta's 13 Most Beautiful remixed by Scott Hardkiss.

It came in a wrap around card sleeve with an extra couple of pages stapled inside with photos from a live performance of 13 Most Beautiful.

I bought this from Piccadilly Records (online). As it was a limited edition I bought it before I posted/tweeted about it ... just in case a post on A Head Full of Wishes caused a surge in sales - I do occasionally have an inflated view of the power of AHFoW!

Despite the fact that I've titled this post "I'll Keep It With Mine" this is another double A side single. I'll try not to get annoyed every time one turns up but singles (almost&dagger;) always have an A and a B side no matter how hard the record company try to convince otherwise - the AA side is invariably a B-side! After all who would think that "Girl's School" by Wings was a Christmas number 1? No one - that's who!

It's as ridiculous as co-headlining tours - you go on last... you're headlining!
