Dean & Britta's live streamed shows were one of the few bright points in the shit show that was 2020 and Quarantine Tapes is a lovely live record of those shows.


Not all of these are from live streamed shows, some were recorded in Dean & Britta's home studio, but I don't have the patience (or acute hearing) to sit down and compare! One we can be faily sure of though is _He Dines Out on Death_ which was included in this set - announced in August 2020, but wasn't played in a live stream until September. 

The set was first released in this box of lathe-cut plastic discs for $75 (and individually or as digital downloads) and is, I guess
