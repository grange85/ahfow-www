Fortune is Damon & Naomi's soundtrack to Naomi's short and silent film Fortune, a film that's initial spark was to create something to be projected during Damon & Naomi's live shows.

It doesn't have a strong narrative but is more a series of vignettes and as such works perfectly well without the film. It also has, in The North Light, one of Damon & Naomi's most beautiful songs.

I have seen Damon & Naomi play the film three times, the first at Cafe OTO in London in May 2014, then at Rough Trade East in April 2015, and finally in April 2016 in Berlin. All were lovely. I think the film works better with live performance - perhaps because of it not really having a narrative. Although ... it does have a story that is [explained on Naomi's web site](https://www.naomivision.com/film).

The album was released in March 2015 and I bought my copy for Â£16.19 from Norman Records.
