This is an advance CD of Galaxie 500's live album _Copenhagen_ that was sent to me in March 1997 by Andrea at Rykodisc ahead of it's release. I [covered this previously in my Artefacts series](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2019/06/07/artefacts-001-galaxie-500-advance-cd/) a few years ago so, once again, expect a bit of a rehash.

It came with a brief press note with all the flowery language you'd expect:

<blockquote>
This spectacular performance shimmers with the finesse that characterized their 3 studio albums, but adds the unsuspected power of their live show.
</blockquote>

I also saw Damon & Naomi for the first time that month and I asked Damon about the live album "I always liked that tape" he said.
