To be honest I knew, back then, and know now, very little about Shapir O'Rama. Dean Wareham appears on vocals on the final track on their first album _El Mundode Vapor Valentia (Old Vienna)_ which came out in 1994.

A bit of internet scouring to be honest hasn't revealed much ... [this article on Trouser Press](https://trouserpress.com/reviews/when-people-were-shorter-and-lived-near-the-water/) suggests that the band exists becuase of a desire of Kim Rancourt (of When People Were Shorter and Lived Near The Water) had a "desire to work on original material with Dave Rick" and so is basically Dave Rick's earlier band Wonderama with Kim Rancourt.

I have this on LP, can't remember when I bought it - possibly early 2000s ... certainly not in 1994 because this completely slipped me by at the time... and only when Kiek pointed out that I hadn't included it in my Dean Wareham discography did I then manage to hunt down a copy. I later had to scrounge a digital copy of the track so that I could share it.
