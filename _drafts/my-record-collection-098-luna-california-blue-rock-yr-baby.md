I had intended giving you all a break between Christmas and New Year but then I decided it would probably be appropriate to throw together a post about Luna's New Year's Eve perennial - there wonderful cover of George McRae's disco masterpiece _Rock Your Baby_&dagger;, which had been a live staple for years before this post-reunion studio version was released in 2017.

Before their split in 2005 it had become a tradition for Luna to play in NYC (or NJ) on NYE, to my knowledge they played...

 - [Luna - 31st December 1996 - Mercury Lounge, New York NY, USA](/database/luna/shows/luna-1996-12-31-mercury-lounge-new-york-ny-usa/)
 - [Luna - 31st December 1998 - Knitting Factory, New York NY, USA](/database/luna/shows/luna-1998-12-31-knitting-factory-new-york-ny-usa/)
 - [Luna - 31st December 2000 - CBGBs, New York NY, USA](/database/luna/shows/luna-2000-12-31-cbgbs-new-york-ny-usa/)
 - [Luna - 31st December 2001 - Knitting Factory, New York NY, USA](/database/luna/shows/luna-2001-12-31-2300-knitting-factory-new-york-ny-usa/)
 - [Luna - 31st December 2002 - Maxwells, Hoboken NJ, USA](/database/luna/shows/luna-2002-12-31-maxwells-hoboken-nj-usa/)
 - [Luna - 31st December 2003 - Mercury Lounge, New York NY, USA](/database/luna/shows/luna-2003-12-31-mercury-lounge-new-york-ny-usa/)
 - [Luna - 31st December 2004 - Southpaw, Brooklyn NY, USA](/database/luna/shows/luna-2004-12-31-southpaw-brooklyn-ny-usa/)

... sometimes two shows a night.

At all of the shows I have a setlist for, they played their cover of George McRae's Rock Your Baby during the night (I don't have setlists for 1996, 1998 or 2003 but have no reason to think they didn't play it at those shows as well). It became such a part of New Year's Eve that in 2005 I felt the need to post a [Roll Your Own Luna new year](/2012/12/31/roll-your-own-luna-new-year-2013-version/) _(this is a repost from 2013)_ collecting together as many recordings of _Rock Your Baby_ as I could find

Dean & Britta looked like they might carry on the tradition when they played a show (and played Rock Your Baby) in 2007

... but that seems to have been a one off.

Post-reunion Luna have played one more New Year's Eve show in 2015

 - [Luna - 31st December 2015 - Starline Social Club, Oakland, CA, USA](/database/luna/shows/luna-2015-12-31-starline-social-club-oakland-ca-usa/)
