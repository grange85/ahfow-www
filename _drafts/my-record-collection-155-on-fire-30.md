In October 2019 Galaxie 500's masterpiece **On Fire** reached 30 years of age. At the beginning of May that year I came up with a half-arsed plan to commemorate this - over the next few months, and mainly because of other people - that half-arsed idea turned into **On Fire | 30**.

{% ahfowimage "url" "caption" %}

The original idea was to create a fanzine, with a piece of _art_ to represent each song on the album - I suggested a pretty loose definition of _art_ to try and encourage participation and there was a little interest although not as much as I'd hoped. However Miguel got in touch shortly after my [call for contributions](/2019/05/01/call-for-contributions-galaxie-500-on-fire-30/) and suggested that we expand this to include an album with bands doing cover versions of each track. So, the short turn-around to produce a fanzine became a short turn-around to produce a fanzine _and_ an album.

My first thought was to release the music on a cassette as it would have been cheaper and a little more quirky, but eventually opted for CD as something more useful (who actually regularly uses cassettes these days?) and, I was hoping, cheaper to post although this may not have been the case.

The whole thing wouldn't have happened but for the contributions of lots of people but most importantly these three:

 - The album wouldn't have happened without Miguel, he rounded up most of the artists including a couple of coups in Britta for one track, and Robert Scott (of The Bats) for another! 
 - John designed the beautiful sleeve and layed out the book and the cd sleeve and disc artwork.
 - Hannah did a fine job of coralling everything, arranging for the book printing and the cd pressing. She also came round and stuffed envelopes when it came to sending things out.

Contributors were "paid" in copies of the finished article.

**On Fire | 30** was released in two formats - a _deluxe edition_ that included the booklet with badges, photos, postcards and the disc - I also andomly included horrendouns, messy, limited-edition lino-cu, and a CD only for folk who just wanted the music - this turned out to be a mistake since nobody wanted just the CD - I still have a few kicking around, I sometimes leave them at gigs just to get rid of a few!

The booklets sold out fairly quickly
