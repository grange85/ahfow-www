In October 2019 Galaxie 500's masterpiece **On Fire** reached 30 years of age. At the beginning of May that year I came up with a half-arsed plan to commemorate this - over the next few months, and mainly because of other people - that half-arsed idea turned into **On Fire | 30**.

{% ahfowimage "url" "caption" %}

The original idea was to create a fanzine, with a piece of _art_ to represent each song on the album - I suggested a pretty loose definition of _art_ to try and encourage participation and there was a little interest although not as much as I'd hoped. However Miguel got in touch shortly after my [call for contributions](http://moonshot.local:4040/2019/05/01/call-for-contributions-galaxie-500-on-fire-30/) and suggested that we expand this to include an album with bands doing cover versions of each track. So, the short turn-around to produce a fanzine became a short turn-around to produce a fanzine _and_ an album.

The album wouldn't have happened without Miguel, he rounded up most of the artists - which explains the rather Spanish heavy content - although he also roped in Britta for one track, and Robert Scott (of The Bats) for another!
