The soundtrack album for Naomi Yang's film _Never Be A Punching Bag for Nobody_ is available now to [stream/buy from Bandcamp](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/never-be-a-punching-bag-for-nobody-original-soundtrack) and to stream in, I suspect, all the usual places (e.g. [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3XVjtjDYGxTRqGmWzmXloL?si=GnXdfOWtQZeJWPVcC1UT9Q)).

This is Naomi's first solo release and is a beautiful and gentle electronic score with added analog atmosphere. As an album it stands alone beautifully, which will have to do for me until the film reaches somewhere I can see it. If, however, you're close enough to Cambridge MA you can see the film at the [Brattle Theatre as part of the Boston Independent Film Festival on Sunday 30th April](https://iffboston.org/series/the-festival/screening/never-be-a-punching-bag-for-nobody).
