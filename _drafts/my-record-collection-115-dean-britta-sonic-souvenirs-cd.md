Sonic Souvenirs was Dean & Britta's second release and contaiins Sonic Boom remixes of tracks from their first release _L'Avventura_, it is an absolute gem!

{% ahfowimage "" "caption" %}

Those first two Dean & Brtta releases were credited as "Britta Phillips & Dean Wareham" - I vaguely remember Dean saying they had toyed with Britta & Dean but the 'a' at the end of Britta and _a_ at the start of that ampersand sounded clunky. I guess he felt that Britta's name should go first. They gave up on that shortly after, and had comfortably settled into Dean & Britta by the time their second album came out in 2007.

Britta offered some insight on the mailing list:

> 'Britta Phililps & Dean Wareham' is just too damned long. Plus people don't know where to file it or find it in stores. It may just end up being 'Dean and Britta'....

In an [interview from 2005](https://midnighttosix.wordpress.com/category/interviews/pete-kember-aka-sonic-boom/) Sonic Boom declared this CD as his "favourite album to listen to high"...

> Possibly 'DEAN WAREHAM & BRITTA PHILLIPS' 'Sonic Souvenirs' EP on Jetset Records. That's a really nice record to get high to â€“ full of great feelings & words.
