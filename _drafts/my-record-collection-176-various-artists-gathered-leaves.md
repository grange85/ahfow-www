In 1998 Ptolemaic Terrascope moved from giving away a 7" EP with the magazine to a CD and in 2016 this LP, that collected a few tracks from the CDs, was released and featured Damon & Naomi with Kurihara's Eye of the Storm as previously available on the Song to the Siren fake live LP.

The idea behind this compilation was to enshrine some of the material previously only available digitally on a format worthy of it's legacy status.

... although Eye of the Storm had already been on a "format worthy of its legacy status" having been released on vinyl as part of the [1001 Nights]() set in 2009. Initially I had wondered whether this might be the [Playback Singers]() version, which _still hasn't been released on a format worth of its legacy status_ but obv that had no Kurihara so couldn't be.

Damon & Naomi's track had originally been on the CD that came with issue 31 of Ptolemaic Terrascope in 2001, more on that later of course!

The whole LP is a treat with contributions from the sort of Terrascopic mix you'd expect.
