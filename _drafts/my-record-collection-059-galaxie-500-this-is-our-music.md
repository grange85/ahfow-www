So, we arrive at another copy of This Is Our Music, and another _limited edition_ release I didn't get on first release. This is a CD in a card slip-case,a fancy tri-fold card sleeve and a pvc wallet. Uniquely&dagger; the CD also has a different sleeve, without the portraits and without the record label and barcode on the front cover.

The missing portraits seems to be rather an odd decision as it leaves a blank gold stretch on the front cover. The portraits do appear, larger in the middle of the fold-out
