This is a five track 7" that came with Chemical Imbalance issue 8 and features a different version of Galaxie 500's Oblivious to the one that turned up on Today. This version was recorded in February 1988 at the same sessions as the tracks on their first single.

This is another of the records that Damon and Naomi sent me in the 7" vinyl care package.
