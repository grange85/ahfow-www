So I closed the quiz and have spent the afternoon totting up the scores. There weren't too many entries but all who did enter did brilliantly... in fact they all did far too brilliantly, so well in fact that I've finished with a five way tie at the top of the table... they even all gave similar answers to the tie-breaker question!

This is heartbreaking to me because it means (because of outrageous postage costs) that there can only be one winner, and that means telling four folk that they haven't won ... despite being brilliant.

Dean Wareham took a look and commented on Instagram "It's a pretty tough quiz" ... he must have bailed early because he didn't submit his answers :)

It was also very reassuring that those who are reading my blog posts are reading them so closely and checking their answers accurately

But, there CAN only be one winner and they have been notified in email

Here are the answers with some commentary:
