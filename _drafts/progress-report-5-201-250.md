Up until now the progress reports have pretty much been nothing more than a bunch of numbers, but since we're now over half-way through the project I thought I should try and be a little more insightful... although, there's still going to be numbers!

When I started the project, back at the beginning of 2023 I don't think I was aware of just how big a project it was, my intention was to just do the occasional post, be a bit selective, and have it all wrapped up in a few months... but, here we are 850 days on and still the end is well over a year away.

Having said that, I have really enjoyed revisiting these records - it's too easy to just keep picking from a small subset so, having a project like this, has forced me to listen to things I haven't listened to very often, and in some cases, not at all. Some of it has been an absolute joy to get back to - for example I really enjoyed pulling out the [Pee Shy records](/2024/07/25/my-record-collection-156-pee-shy-who-let-all-the-monkeys-out/) that Dean produced; or listening to _the other tracks_ on the compilations that have only one or two tracks that got them included - e.g. [The Ladybug Transistor and Kevin Ayers playing Puis-je/May I]() on [Pop Romantique](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2023/08/31/my-record-collection-065-pop-romantique-french-pop-classics/) and [Marbles by Tindersticks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKRfWcRZpYM) that appeared on [Speed Dating](/2024/08/22/my-record-collection-164-various-artists-speed-dating/) - although I'll be happy never to have to listen to Dwarves again (on that same comp).

I have sometimes found it tricky to come up with interesting things to say so posts can vary in length:
