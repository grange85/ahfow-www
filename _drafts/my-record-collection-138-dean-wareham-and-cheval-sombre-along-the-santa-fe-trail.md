This is my second copy of the _Along The Santa Fe Trail_ lathe cut single, I think Dean sent me this copy, the previous one was the one that came with the deluxe edition of the [Dean Wareham vs Cheval Sombre release]().

Since it's a one sided single I thought as well as listening to it, this time I'd also watch [Santa Fe Trail]() the film that the song comes from. I have probably seen this before way, way back in the day but certainly not in the last 40 or so years. I'm not a great fan of westerns, although there are a good few westerns that I do love. I also love Olivia de Havilland and her 30s and 40s partnership with Errol Flynn and Michael Curtiz, and while I'm not expecting a Captain Blood, or The Adventures of Robin Hood, I'm hoping it might put up a decent show... as long as its better than The Charge of The Light Brigade I'll be happy.
