Damon & Naomi's first shows in the UK for close to two years were announced in November so I booked travel and hotel and waited for the three dates at Cafe Oto at the beginning of January.

On the morning of the first show I awoke in Whitley Bay to a layer of snow and news of Metro delays, and a points failure in Darlington that promised to make the journey longer than expected. I headed into Newcastle for the train down to London and arrived at King's Cross a half hour later than planned but not as bad as the on-train announcements suggested (although just long enough to get a 50% refund!).

I'd booked myself into the Premier Inn just around the corner from Cafe Oto and so was able to wander to the venue a few minutes before doors... and arrived to find a lengthy queue. Once inside I positioned myself to the right of the stage and waited for the show to start...

### Day 1

Opening the show was comedian Stewart Lee (last seen at Krankenhaus with Dean & Britta) who did a short and enjoyable (enjoyably short?) routine to warm the crowd before introducing Laetitia Sadier (of Stereolab) to the stage. Laetitia was playing solo - just her, a guitar, an electronic box-of-tricker ("my band") and a trombone. A lovely varied and humorous set ensued with a bit of mime thrown in for good measure.

In the interval I repositioned myself to the left of the stage, where it was cooler.
