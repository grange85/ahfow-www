Damon & Naomi's first shows in the UK for close to two years were announced in November so I booked travel and hotel and waited for the three dates at Cafe Oto at the beginning of January.

On the morning of the first show I awoke in Whitley Bay to a layer of snow and news of Metro delays, and a points failure in Darlington that promised to make the journey longer than expected. I headed into Newcastle for the train down to London and arrived at King's Cross a half hour later than planned but not as bad as the on-train announcements suggested (although just long enough to get a 50% refund!).

I'd booked myself into the Premier Inn just around the corner from Cafe Oto and so was able to wander to the venue a few minutes before doors... and arrived to find a lengthy queue. Once inside I positioned myself to the right of the stage and waited for the show to start...

### Day one

Before the show Naomi came over and handed me a folded up bit of paper and made me promise not to look at it until the show was over.

Opening the show was comedian Stewart Lee (last seen at Krankenhaus with Dean & Britta) who did a short and enjoyable (enjoyably short?) routine to warm the crowd before introducing Laetitia Sadier (of Stereolab) to the stage. Laetitia was playing solo - just her, a guitar, an electronic box-of-tricker ("my band") and a trombone. A lovely varied and humorous set ensued with a bit of mime thrown in for good measure.

In the interval I repositioned myself to the left of the stage, where it was cooler.

Stewart Lee did another short routine and introduced Damon & Naomi who performed a set of songs from accross the years before being joined by Laetita Sadier and Pulp's Mark Webber for an astounding and all too short set of Galaxie 500 classics - all with Laetitia on vocals (and trombone - which worked perfectly) FIrst up Flowers, and then When Will You Come Home ... "we don't have a word for 'home' in French... it's 'a la maison' [...] incroyable", and finishing with Tugboat - I honestly can't even begin to express the joy of seeing this collision of my two absolute favourite bands from the late 80s/early 90s. Add to that Mark Webber's beautiful guitar augmentations. Perfect!

Now, some folk might want a Galaxie 500 reunion - I don't - but I do want to see this line-up doing a "plays Galaxie 500" tour"!

Show over, I unfolded the note from Naomi which was the set-list, which I then got Damon and Naomi to sign and then headed back to the hotel.

### Day two

Up fairly early and walked to have breakfast at Hash E8 - a very lovely Eggs FLorentine with added slabs of goats cheese, and then decided to take the bus to Abney Park Cemetry to kill an hour or so - I've been before but was inspired by Naomi mentioning it the previous night. I then took the Overground to Hampstead to meet some old work friends for lunch and spent a happy couple of hours drinking coffee and nattering. Then back to the hotel to recharge both my phone and my self.

I arrived at Cafe Oto slightly earlier, and therefore to a slightly shorter queue and so this time managed to find a chair although with the intention of giving it up and standing for Damon & Naomi's set.

The show once again opened with a short routine (almost the same routine) from Stewart Lee and then a short, near-comedy set from Richard Youngs that finished with Stewart Lee reading cards of computer code... "type BASIC"... "input 'enter amount'"...  etc., accompanied by Richard playing guitar and occasionally adding wordless singing.

Followed by a short interval during which I relocated, standing behind the rows of seats and therefore having a better view. Naomi handed me another "secret setlist".

Damon & Naomi played another career-spanning set before being joined ny Richard Youngs for a couple of Galaxie 500 numbers - Spook and Decomposing Trees - colder, more melancholic interpretations than the previous night's - and with Richard's, sometimes discordant guitar accompaniment. Different, but also beaitiful!

The band were then joined by Jess from Still House Plants who added a beuatiful and unique voice to a mesmerising rendition of Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste.

I bought myself a copy of Damon's book and got it signed and acquired a black-vinyl copy of the live Galaxie 500 CBGBs recording since the limited edition "Ultra Clear And Black Cloudy" version was horrid - it looked like a five year old had scribbled it with a marker pen! Also a Galaxie 500 patch - apparently from a "failed beanie" idea.

### Day three
