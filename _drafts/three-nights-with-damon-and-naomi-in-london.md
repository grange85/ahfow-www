Damon & Naomi's first shows in the UK for close to two years were announced in November so I booked travel and hotel and waited for the three dates at Cafe Oto at the beginning of January.

On the morning of the first show I awoke in Whitley Bay to a layer of snow and news of Metro delays, and a points failure in Darlington that promised to make the journey longer than expected. I headed into Newcastle for the train down to London. The promised delays never materialised.
