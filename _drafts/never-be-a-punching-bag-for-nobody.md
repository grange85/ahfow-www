In November 2022 while idly scouring all the usual places for _news_ I came across the trailer on Naomi's Vimeo for a film called _Never Be a Punching Bag for Nobody_ about which, at the time, I knew nothing - my first thought was that it was something I had somehow missed. Anyone who had followed Naomi's Instagram for any length of time can't failed to have noticed two key factors that pre-dated this discovery:

 - Naomi had been making videos and short films for quite a while, most notably her film [Fortune]() and music videos for the likes of Meg Baird, Julie Holter, Tanya Donnely, and Future Bible Hereos.
 - Naomi had in recent years (bafflingly) taken up boxing!

The trailer that had been uploaded in June 2022, gave no clues as to when this was, or was going to be, released. I [posted it on AHFoW](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2022/11/09/naomi-yang-never-be-a-punching-bag/) and left it at that.

On the 9th February Naomi officially announced the film on her website and decalred that it was "coming soon in 2023".

<blockquote>
The film weaves together three stories: colorful boxing coach and ex-drill sergeant Sal Bartolo Jr., son of a renowned 1940s East Boston boxing champ; Yang herself, learning boxing from trainer Bartolo and reexamining some of her own family’s disturbing history; and schoolteacher Mary Ellen Welch, who in the 1960s mobilized a group of neighborhood women against encroachment from Logan airport, fighting back against an indifferent city government.

The film premiered on 30th April as part of the Boston Independent Film Festival, you can see the post-screening discussion with Naomi and Sal Bartolo Jr. here:

The film was then made available on some streaming services with a bonus of an interview with Naomi by Stewart Lee - you can see that on Vimeo now:

The film is beautiful and heartfelt with it's three intermingled storylines - Naomi's boxing, the expansion of Logan Airport, and Naomi's relationship with her father
