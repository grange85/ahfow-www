I was lucky enough to get a preview of Naomi Yang's new film, Never Be a Punching Bag for Nobody, which is being [screened on Sunday as part of the Boston Independent Film Festival](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2023/04/14/tickets-on-sale-for-the-premiere-of-naomi-yang-s-new-film/).

The film describes Naomi's unexpected induction into boxing at a gym near Logan Airport in East Boston, and through that tells stories of personal and social change, of local and environmental activism, and of the often careless neglect of humanity. 

The film, as you'd expect given Naomi's design and video work over the years, is beautifully shot, finding beauty where it's sometimes not obvious. This is mixed in with archive material covering the history of the area and the stories. All narrated by Naomi with her [beautiful soundtrack]() accompanying it.
