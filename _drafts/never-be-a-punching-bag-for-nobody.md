I was lucky enough to get a preview of Naomi Yang's new film, Never Be a Punching Bag for Nobody, which is being screened on Friday as part of the Boston Independent Film Festival.

The film describes Naomi's unexpected journey into boxing at a gym near Logan Airport in East Boston, and through that tells stories of personal and social change, of local and environmental activism, and of the often careless neglect of humanity.
