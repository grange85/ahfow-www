No Excess Is Absurd was Magic Hour's first album and is the one with the bonus of having Naomi doing a gorgeous vocal on their [cover of folk standard Sally Free and Easy](). It was released in the uk by Che records and I would have bought this round the time it was released in 1994.

Now, 1994 was the very early days of the Internet, I started A Head Full of Wishes in the autumn of that year. Magic Hour toured the UK in October 1994 ... I managed to miss [this news item in NME]() and so managed to _not_ see them when they toured. There is a [video of their show at The Sausage Machine in Camden on the 28th October]() which should make me happy but just makes me all the more annoyed that I missed it.

My CD of this is dying. When they were new, CDs were pitched as [being indestructible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMp1pSVxoqw&t=28s) but ... no, turns out this was nonsense - in fact not indestructible rather they fail more catastrophically - I'll have a story to tell about this in a later post. Luckily ... No Excess is Absurd is one of the many releases in this series I have multiple copies of so my dying Che CD isn't a complete catastrophe.
