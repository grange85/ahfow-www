This is an audience recording of Luna at The Knitting Factory in NYC on the 14th July 2000, the note next to this in my catalogue spreadsheet says "average quality bootleg, not digitised" - I think _average_ is being a little generous. I pondered digitising it anyway but decided it wasn't worth my effort.

Just to add another reason for not digitising this show is that it was one of the source shows recorded _properly_ for [Luna Live](/database/luna/releases/luna-live/) - and this being from the 14th of July, Bastille Day, this is the source of Dean's "I support the French Revolution" intro on that album. Of course one of the quirks of the live album is that on the album Dean does that speech between Anesthesia and Tiger Lily which are, according to the sleeve, tracks that Justin played on - but this show was one of the shows recorded after Justin had left the band, so Britta was on stage when Dean was speaking, and Justin was about 9,000 miles away!
