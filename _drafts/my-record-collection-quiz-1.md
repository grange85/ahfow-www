Now, since we're close to 100 posts in the series, and since it's almost Christmas, and since I get very little feedback on my posts (OK, a bit on Twitter, FB and Instagram, and the occasional email) - I decided to make sure that my dedicated readers, are actually reading!

So - here are twenty questions, the answers to all of them can be found in the [my record collection](http://moonshot.local:4040/category/my-record-collection/) series of posts, some will be easy to track down the answers to, others might require a bit of _lateral thinking_ or _legwork_ - there will be a prize for the person with the most correct answers.
