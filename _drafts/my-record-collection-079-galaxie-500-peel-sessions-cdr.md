As I [mentioned on my previous Peel Sessions post]() this was the major omission from the lovely box set and in between the relase of that and the official release of The Peel Sessions nine years later, I took advantage of my employment in BBC Information & Archives to acquire a copy of Galaxie 500's Peel sessions and burnt them on this CD.

My CDR is obviously better than the official release because:

1. The sessions are presented in the correct order.
2. It doesn't have a sleeve with portraits that are only vaguely reminscent of their subjects.

I can't remember where I pinched the astronimical illustrations I used on the sleeve from, but I'm still rather partial to it and it's clearly me riffing on the box set design ... although, I'm not a designer!
