This is the replacement copy of Luck or Magic that Britta sent me after [my first arrived damaged](/2023/03/27/my-record-collection-020-britta-phillips-luck-or-magic-lp/)

I didn't really talk _about_ the album last time so here's a quick track-by-track blast...

 - __Daydream__ is a track that pre-dates Britta's time with Luna, or perhaps from her early days with Luna, since she had a demo posted on her website in 2000 
{% ahfowaudio {
"audiourl": "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/audio/britta-phillips-00-daydream-demo.mp3<F2>",
"audiocap": "Britta Phillips - Daydream (demo, 2000)"
} %}

 - __Do It Last__ has a lovely/strange breathy-keyboard solo going into the bridge.
 - __One Fine Summer Morning__ was [originally recorded by Evie Sands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqLjkU57HF0) for her lovely 1968 album _Any Way That You Want Me_.
 - __Million Dollar Doll__ first turned up on the soundtrack of the Noah Baumbach film _Frances Ha_ as instrumental background music in a bar scene. It was then included on what seems to be a very rare, promo only, soundtrack album credited to Dean & Britta - I scrounged a copy off Britta...
> It was quite a last minute request to have the song on the sound track so it's kind of a rough mix. I still might put it on my solo "thing." Maybe give it a fresh mix.
 - I was never a fan of __Drive__ and then its use during Live Aid didn't help with that, so I wasn't too sure what to make of Britta's cover. I like it but it's still tainted by the original.
 - __Fallin' in Love__ was first released on a [split single with Dean Wareham's _Love_](/database/dean-wareham/releases/singles/#loveshade-017) on the other side by Formosa Punk in 2014.
 - __Luck or Magic__
 - __Landslide__ was written by Stevie Nicks and first [recorded for Fleetwood Mac's 1975 eponymous album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM7-PYtXtJM).
 - __Wrap Your Arms Around Me__ was originally by ex-Abba member Agnetha Faltskog's first English language solo album (also called Wrap Your Arms Around Me). Britta sings _fake-Swedish_ in the song.
 - __Ingrid Superstar__
