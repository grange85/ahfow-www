Here's a timeline of my experience of the Bandbox debacle that (sort of) concluded last week when Dean Wareham kindly gave me copies of two of the three live albums.

{% ahfowimage "url" "caption" %}

- **19th January 2017**: Luna play Bewitched in full live at The Chapel in San Francisco.
- **20th January 2017**: Luna play Penthouse in full live at The Chapel in San Francisco.
- **21st January 2017**: Luna play Rendezvous in full live at The Chapel in San Francisco.
- **4th February 2022**: #BandcampFriday and [Luna release a recording of the Bewitched show](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2022/02/04/luna-live-bewitched-on-bandcamp/) as a download on Bandcamp. The album was mixed by Lee, and features Kelly Kyle on trumpet, and a bonus of Indian Summer.
- **4th March 2022**: #BandcampFriday and the [Penthouse show](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/live-penthouse) gets a digital only release - bonus track Tracy I Love You.
- **1st April 2022**: Another #BandcampFriday sees the release of the final show, [Rendezvous](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/live-rendezvous) with an awesome Fuzzy Wuzzy as a bonus.
- **14th March 2023**: Bandbox announce a 2xLP vinyl release of the Live Penthouse album, with shipping expected in July - they start taking pre-orders for a "seafoam swirl" release.  
  I pre-order my copy for $44.99 + $19.99 shipping - total $64.98. I don't tell Hazel!
- **21st June 2023**: Bandbox announce that they will also be releasing 2xLP versions of Live Bewitched and Live Rendezvous, they offer discounts for customers buying two, or three album. Also promised is a "fanzine" which will include interviews, photos, and "more".  
  After a bit of email back/forth with Bandbox, I sort of get my discount on the pre-orders and pay an additional $55.98 bringing my total paid to $120.96!
- **July 2023** comes and goes and no sign of Penthouse. The Bandbox website now says the albums will be shipped in October.
- **October 2023** comes and goes and still no sign of any of the albums.
- **November 2023**: The first of a few emails I send to Bandbox - I get a prompt reply from Pam:
<blockquote>

<p>
We are waiting for Luna albums to arrive in our waehouse, and we have been notified by the pressing plant that these albums are scheduled to ship to us later this week and we should receive them next week.
</p>

<p>
We understand this may be frustrating. We plan to ship as soon as possible. I appreciate your continued patience.
</p>

<p>
If the wait is not acceptable, please let me know, we can exchange or cancel if this works better for you. Otherwise, we will ship asap.
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,
</p>

<p>
Pam

- I opt to wait
- **2nd Jan 2024**: Another email sent, and another prompt reply, and here's where *I* make my big mistake!

<blockquote>

<p>
Still waiting on the Luna Rendezvous, I will ask the team to ship the other 2 now. Will this be ok?
</p>

<p>

<p>
Hi Pam,
</p>
<p>
I'd be happy to wait for all three at once but it would be nice to have some idea how long that wait might be?

- ... and that's the last personal communication I get
- **13th January 2024**: Dean Wareham puts some copies of _all three_ releases up for sale on his website (cheaper than the Bandbox ones!) - I don't buy them because I'll be getting the Bandbox ones soon!
- **15th February 2024**: Email to Bandbox - "Still no sign of this?? Any news ... getting on for a year since I placed the first part of the order and I would have had them if I'd waited and ordered copies from the band last month!!" - no reply.
- **20th February 2024**: Email to Bandbox - "This is looking increasingly depressing - could you please let me know the state of this" - no reply.
- **23rd February 2024**: Bandbox "entered into an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors under Chapter 577 of the Minnesota Statutes" - but didn't tell the customers... yet.
- **27th February 2024**: Email to Bandbox - "Any news on this, I haven't had replies and some hint that I might actually get the albums I ordered" - no reply.
- **5th March 2024**: Email to Bandbox - "I would really appreciate a response regarding this" - no reply.
- **6th March 2024**: Email from Bandbox

<blockquote>

<p>
Bandbox is filing an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors. They are doing this in order to allow a court supervised process to liquidate the companyâ€™s assets and distribute the proceeds according to priorities established in law.

Thanks for the memories,

That "thanks for the memories" was a nice little sign off! Probably should have read "thanks for the $120 that didn't buy you anything".

In amongst all of that there were promises, discount cards you could buy, some bullshit about not being able to source the "brown pellets" for the Live Rendezvous.

A couple of weeks ago I got an email from Dean saying that he had a copy of the Bewitched and Rendezvous live albums for me and last week he was in London coincidentally at the same time I was and we met up and now I have two of the three LPs.
