<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/47988537793/in/dateposted/" title="Galaxie 500 - Copenhagen advance CD and press release"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47988537793_76cddacefc_b.jpg" width="934" height="1024" alt="Galaxie 500 - Copenhagen advance CD and press release"></a>

In [March 1997 Damon & Naomi played at the 12 Bar Club](/1997/03/19/review-damon-naomi-12-bar-club-london-uk-19th-march-1997/) on Denmark Street in London - it was the first time I'd seen Damon & Naomi since Galaxie 500 had split up, and therefore since A Head Full of Wishes had come into being (in 1994) - I got up the nerve to say "hi" to them between their two sets - "oh we're afraid of you" said Damon . Damon mentioned the upcoming Copenhagen release ("I always liked that tape"), I don't remember whether I'd already received this promo from Andrea at Rykodisc then.

> Make sure you pay extra careful attention to the excellent crowd patter. Those crazy Danes!
