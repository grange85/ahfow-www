I can't remember how this Galaxie 500 _Radio Sampler_ came into my posession, either a fan sent it to me (if so, thanks) or I bought it on eBay - one thing I'm certain of is that I didn't pay Â£3.99 for it in Our Price which the sticker on the case suggests, since - it's a promo and wouldn't/shouldn't be sold in a shop and, more pertinently, Our Price went out of business 5 years before Domino put this out.

This sampler was put out to promote the Domino re-releases in 2009 and collects one track from each of Galaxie 500's albums. Interestingly that while it picks the singles from On Fire (Blue Thunder) and This Is Our Music (Fourth of July), it opts for Oblivious rather than Tugboat from Today.
