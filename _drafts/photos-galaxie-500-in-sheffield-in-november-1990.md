After the [show in Leeds]() finished a couple of weeks back, while loitering in the venue Janet came up and introduced herself and mentioned that she'd seen Galaxie 500 a number of times in Sheffield back in the day, and that she had some photos from the show taken by her friend Scragga at the gig. A couple of days later a bunch of emails arrived loaded up with these!
