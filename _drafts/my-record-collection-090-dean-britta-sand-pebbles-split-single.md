This 7" is split with Australian band Sand Pebbles and was limited to 300 copies to be sold at dates on their 2001 Australian tour. Dean & Britta's side contains a Sonic Boom remix of I'll Keep it With Mine (possibly the only release with this remix).

The Sand Pebbles side has the excellent Occupied Europe (Take Me Across The Water).
