This is a sealed copy of the lovely double DVD of video that the band released in 2004, it was given to me as a gift and, since I already had a copy, stayed in it's shrink wrap - as an archival copy - it is after all the only Galaxie 500 release that I get a name check on!

Since it's sealed I guess all I can talk about is what's on the outside (I'll talk about what's inside later).

It contains a hype sticker on the front:

<blockquote>
<p>4 HOURS on 2 DVDs</p>
<p>"Galaxie 500 make some of the starkest, most **beautiful** American underground music"<br>MELODY MAKER</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">DVD case hype sticker</p>

That quote is from a [1996 Stephen Pastel review of the Galaxie 500 box set](https://oblivious.fullofwishes.co.uk/post/46418741985/stephen-pastel-reviews-the-galaxie-500-box-set-for)

There's another quote on the back that I have to take a bit of exception with...

<blockquote>
<p>"One of the most influential bands to emerge from the late-80s independent rock scene"<br>Karen Schomer, The New York Times</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Quote on the back of the DVD case</p>

I found the origin of that quote in a [1990 New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/arts/pop-view-music-s-new-catatonia-don-t-bother-getting-up.html), but the actual quote is:

<blockquote>
<p>Galaxie 500 <strong>could be</strong> one of the most influential bands to emerge from the late-80's independent rock scene.</p>
</blockquote>
