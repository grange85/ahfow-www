Luna's wonderful cover of Michel Polnareff's _La Poupée qui fait non_ first appeared on this compilation of 'French Pop Classics' in 1995.

Obviously I love _La Poupee..._ and have listened to it a lot over the years but I must admit it's been a while since I listened to the whole of this album. It is very lovely and has a couple of top notch guest appearances from legends no longer with us - Francoise Hardy with Air, and Kevin Ayers with The Ladybug Transistor.

Most of the songs on here are bona-fide pop classics, including four from the pen of Gainsbourg but there are a couple of ... outliers/cheats that possibly s-t-r-e-t-c-h the '_**French** pop classics_' definition:

__1:__ Lloyd Cole covers Fairport Convention's cover of Bob Dylan's 'If You Gotta Go Now' - in 1969 The Fairport's decided to translate Dylan's song into French ... which got me wondering why? Apparently the answer is that the band ["thought it would be amusing to do Dylan’s song in French cajun style"](https://mainlynorfolk.info/fairport/songs/situdoispartir.html)

__2:__ The Ladybug Transistor roped Kevin Ayers in to do a French language cover of his brilliant (but ... rather creepy) 'May I?' ... called 'Puis-Je?' - I assume this was the beginning of the relationship that led to Kevin's last album "The Unfairground" that had an [impressive line up of guests](http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=17317)!

I still wince with embarrassment about the time I tweeted an [unnecessarily snarky comment](https://twitter.com/grange85/status/49265990810345472/) about how [beautiful young Michel](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/licensed-image?q=tbn:ANd9GcTA7jGAbmJvVdsVAWTfy-Q6UmOF0I0ckDC2zYQaBoPofd_s_rM5ng_MrJTTCeSaRnPgJEsgwlU1F6KPWLw) was a little ... erm ... different from [Michel's subsequent style](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rhiJcSdvL._UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg) ... and it got _retweeted_ by the great man himself (_or more likely his team who didn't pick up the snark_) - particularly as he was still beautiful ... just differently beautiful.
