Another copy of Luna's final first-phase single Speedbumps. When Little Teddy Records announced this as a single I wrote to Dean to tell him how pleased I was because "it was the track that cried out 'single' when I first heard Rendezvous".

The b-side has two songs and runs at 33rpm, luckily the label clearly declares what speed you should spin the record at. Track _b1_, Astronaut, was the first track with music written by Lee Wall that was recorded by Luna (I think he also wrote _Star-Spangled Man_) - the lyrics were written by Dean. The track was recorded during the Romantica sessions and was released on the _Close Cover Before Striking_ EP and then remixed for Rendezvous.

Astronaut was quite a live regular towards the end of Luna's first phase but think it might only have been played recently when they performed Rendezvous in full back in 2017.

I moaned last time about the labels claiming this is a double A-side... but it just occurred to me that since the flip has two songs on it does this make it a triple-A side!
