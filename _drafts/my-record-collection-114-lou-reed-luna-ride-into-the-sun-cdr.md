This is a CDR of a live recording of Luna playing Ride Into The Sun with Lou Reed live on their tour supporting him in 1996. I have [posted about this before](/2019/07/12/artefacts-007-cdr-of-luna-and-lou-reed/) in the [Artefacts](/category/artefacts/) series I did a few years ago so this will be a bit of a cut and paste job. Sorry!

I can't find the accompanying communication that came with this but my memory is that Dean Wareham asked me not to make public this recording's provenance - but, given that he himself shared this recording on Soundcloud after Lou's passing in 2013, I guess it's OK for me to say that this CDR was sent to me by Dean back in 2004 specifically to put on A Head Full of Wishes.

That's Dean's handwriting on the CDR and it clearly says that it was live in Boston 1996 but this is the same recording as the one on Soundcloud that claims to be from the following night's show in NYC. Unless Dean wants to clarify I'm going to assume he was right when he wrote it on the CDR!

I didn't get too many exclusives for AHFoW so this was quite exciting - and was, for many years the most downloaded mp3 I ever shared and still periodically gets folk happening upon it.
