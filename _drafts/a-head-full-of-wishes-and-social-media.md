I must admit that over the last few years I have found the way social media has moved to be quite depressing, so I thought it was time to reign myself in and ease myself away from certain platforms. This has little to do with the evils of ownership (because all platforms have their issues in that area - even the ones that aren't technically "owned"), but it has more to do with the way that platforms deliver their content, the evils of their algorithms, their advertising, and their extortion and payola scams. 

I'm doing this because I no longer want to spread myself so widely, and therefore so thinly around - although... still quite wide, and quite thin!

### TL;DR

  - The website is my pride and joy - it has news, regular articles, a discography and gigography (that even Dean uses when researching), and has over 30 years of my life in it:

You'll notice that Twitter/X is not in those lists, of all the platforms Twitter is the one which has most notably changed. It's unbearable to use (and became more so when Twitter bought Tweedeck and ruined it). Over the last couple of years AHFoW has mostly just been auto-posting on the platform, and without any engagement I found myself spending less and less time looking after it. For those reasons, and for many others, I have decided to stop using Twitter/X as of now. The [@ahfow](https://x.com/ahfow) account will still be there and will still be able to be reached that way but I won't be posting or monitoring it in any notable way. The seventeen years of posts will, for now, remain.

The same applies to my personal account at [@grange85](https://x.com/grange85).

There are a few other places you'll find AHFoW but mostly in archived or legacy forms.

 - I [posted quite a lot on a Tumblr](https://oblivious.fullofwishes.co.uk/) back in the day and that's all still there.
 - Once upon a time Flickr was close to perfect but... it's a bit shit now, but does have a fair bit in the [A Head Full of Wishes Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/aheadfullofwishes/pool/).
 - I posted a [potted history of the Galaxie 500 Mailing List](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/the-galaxie-500-mailing-list-est) on Substack a while back and technically it [still exists here](https://groups.google.com/g/fullofwishes).
 - There's also a [Mixcloud with three mixes](https://www.mixcloud.com/grange85/) of AHFoW related stuff!

### The bit where I rant a little

Engagement has dropped across all platforms, partly I think because everyone is suffering from social-media-overload, or just that social media has lost somewhat the "social" bit. I can't really be too critical because I'm not exactly the king of _engagers_.

The other aspect that has become more frustrating is the way that the big players are building walls around their products - we once dreamed of this wonderful interconnected world where content could easily be shared and found. Now, by restricting and rate-limiting their APIs, paywalling content, obscuring content discovery behind undocumented algorithms, anyone who _needs_ content to be discovered are being forced to pay for that discovery. Now, AHFoW isn't, never has been, and never will be, something that is a commercial enterprise and so I won't play this game, but that means that it relies on word of mouth and luck to get discovered.

I love talking (well typing) about these bands and so the demise of places to talk (type) is a little sad but for all the good that the Internet is (and I have made so many friends thanks to it over the 30 plus years), there is so much that isn't good and it is being ruined by capitalism, by hate, by a sad lack of empathy.

There's an oft-used criticism that we have all become siloed and are just living in our echo chambers... I sort of wish that was a tiny but true but unfortunately it's not.

Sometimes it's worth seeing the trees, not the wood!
