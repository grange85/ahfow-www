Having assumed that the [previous Mistress America CD](/2023/06/22/my-record-collection-045-mistress-america-soundtrack-cd/) was sent to me by Dean I guess I must have bought this somewhere, although I can't find any evidence to suggest where. This ones been opened so it was the first one I owned.

So having damned the album with faint praise last time out - "while perhaps not loving it, I could at least appreciate it" - let's consider the other aspects that didn't really make it a Dean & Britta album ... namely the tracks that aren't by Dean & Britta:

 - __Souvenir - Orchestral Manoeuvres in The Dark__  
   This is clearly the baseline inspiration for D&B's recordings for the soundtrack ... in fact, until the vocal arrives if you didn't know better you'd assume it _was_ one of their contributions. Since it was a big hit in the UK in '81 I was already familiar with the song.  
   Souvenir was released in the UK on the 4th August 1981 - on the 1st August I was at Port Vale stadium watching Motorhead ... OMD were that off my radar!

 - __No More Lonely Nights - Paul McCartney__  
   ... OK, so I was a headbanger in '81, but I'd always been, and would always be, a Macca fan - since the red/blue Beatles comps came out in 73, and probably even before then. And I sometimes loved Wings as much as The Beatles ([me and Partridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyZspqjtG2k)!). No More Lonely Nights is from Paul's underrated Give My Regards to Broad Street film, and is a beauty.

 - __Dream Baby Dream - Suicide__
