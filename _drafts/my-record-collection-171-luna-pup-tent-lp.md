My first/primary copy of Luna's Pup Tent was on CD, this LP was bought later, although I can't remember (or find any clues in my email) of how much later.

Pup Tent was the second Luna LP made during the lifetime of the Mailing List and was the first to receive _mixed_ reviews on the list...

<blockquote>
Holy disappointment. I just received an advance of Pup Tent. I am praying
to the music Gods that this is just a sick joke and that I will soon fall
madly in love with this album. So far, it is not even a small case of puppy
love.

Okay, a lot of people have been voicing some negative first impressions about
pup tent. And no, it isn't the Luna we've grown accustomed to over the last
three albums, but at least they've stopped playing it safe. You can't knock
the band for doing something different.

Well I got pup tent, as usual I first thought, "not as good as the
last". Then I played it in the car; more like wearing headphones as
opposed to background music for when I am cleaning, cooking or just
beating my meat etc.. As has happened in the past I like it more with
each listen, remembering some of the songs from live shows; where luna
really shines

Pup Tent was a nice pop record and Dean did a nice tour
behind it, but it does not thave the passion that I
associate with G500 and even the very early Luna stuff.
