The first of a few American Laundromat tribute albums that will turn up in this series - this one is _A Tribute to The Cure_ from 2008, and has Dean & Britta covering Friday I'm In Love and is very lovely.

It's odd but there are bands that I don't really get - it's difficult to explain, I don't really have an opinion on The Cure ... more of a complete _lack of opinion_, like I just can't be bothered to find out if there as great as so many people think they are. Maybe they are... and maybe some day I'll _get it_. Although [this video for Friday I'm In Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGgMZpGYiy8) is truly awful so I may need to get that out of my head before I even consider trying!

Having said that the tracks on this album are mostly very familiar, they have seeped into my consciousness without any effort from me, or from The Cure - maybe that is their skill? And they're being covered by lots of familiar names here, and they mostly sound ... fine.
