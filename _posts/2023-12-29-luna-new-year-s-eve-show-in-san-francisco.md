Luna are playing a live show in San Francisco on Sunday night to see in the new year and it sounds pretty unmissable if you happen to be nearby (or can get yourself nearby). The show will be at the Fillmore and will feature a Luna "regular set" and will be followed, once 2024 arrives, by a set of Velvet Underground and Lou Reed gems - [tickets are available here](https://concerts.livenation.com/luna-san-francisco-california-12-31-2023/event/1C005F5EF2C6779A).

That _regular_ set will, I suspect include their New Year's regular cover of George McRae's disco classic Rock Your Baby - here they are, playing at The Fillmore in 2005 on their farewell tour as featured in Matthew Buzzell's fab _rockumentary_ Tell Me Do You Miss Me.

The VU/Lou set will undoubtedly include Britta performing Femme Fatale which is as swoonily brilliant as you can imagine here's a [clip of them performing it in San Diego](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBym_5yYANo) earlier in the year, and New Sensations which you [can see them rehearsing here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R28XEy1aHIE).
