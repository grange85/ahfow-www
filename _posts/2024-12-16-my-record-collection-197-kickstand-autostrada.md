Kickstand were an Hoboken based indie band who released a couple of albums in the later 90s, Autostrada was the second of these released in 1997 and Dean Wareham plays guitar on three tracks.

I heard about this release, and Dean's involvement in it, around the time of release via the Galaxie 500 Mailing List, but didn't actually get around to buying a copy until much later - although I think I must have had mp3s of it (or at least some of it) before then.

The band was made up of Jeff Feurzeig and twin sisters Tammi and Torri Colichio, and the album is sweet, mostly keyboard/synth driven, lo-fi songs. Maybe it outstays it's welcome a little but the sweet bits are exceptionally sweet.

Dean appears on three tracks _Flying Saucers are Real_, _Voyage to Illunination_ and a cover of Daniel Johnston's _Cosmic Kid_

Jeff Feurzeig is a film-maker who later made [The Devil and Daniel Johnston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_and_Daniel_Johnston) and was the producer of [a previous entry in this series](/2024/08/05/my-record-collection-159-lys-guillorn-cd/). He will be getting at least one more mention.
