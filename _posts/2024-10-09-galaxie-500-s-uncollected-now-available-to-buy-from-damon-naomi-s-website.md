Galaxie 500's _Uncolected Noise New York '88 - '90_ is now available to buy from Damon & Naomi's [20\|20\|20 website](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/) including (an undetermined number of) copies of the "handmade edition" which, if you can afford it, is a much nicer version IMO (I explained why I thought that in [my post earlier this week](/2024/10/08/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-09-and-10-galaxie-500-uncollected-noise-new-york-88-90/)) - they're limited to 500 copies and I can't imagine there are too many left so [head there quickly](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/galaxie-500-uncollected-lp) if you want a copy.

There are also three different colour vinyl variants, plus black, and CD and cassette versions if they take your fancy.
