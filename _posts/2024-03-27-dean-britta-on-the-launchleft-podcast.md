Dean & Britta are the guests of the [latest issue of the LaunchLeft podcast]()

<blockquote>
On this episode of LaunchLeft, Rain welcomes Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips of LUNA. They talk about how they first met, how music found them, performing live versus the recording studio, and the volatility of the music industry. Dean shares what’s up next for them, both as a duo and as solo artists. Dean & Britta launch Ryder the Eagle to close the show and we hear about the new single and album “Autotango”. He discusses what led him to write the record and what we can expect to hear from him next. Listen and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts today!
