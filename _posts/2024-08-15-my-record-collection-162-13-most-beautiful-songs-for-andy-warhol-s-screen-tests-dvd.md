This is another copy of the DVD release of Dean & Britta's _13 Most Beautiful..._, this one is still in its shrink-wrap since I bought it after Dean had sent me [the copy I previously posted about](/2024/05/02/my-record-collection-132-13-most-beautiful-dvd/). I either bought this around the time of release or possibly when Plexifilm were having one of their occasional sales.

It does feel a bit odd owning duplicate, unopened copies of these releases, and I'm not entirely sure why - I tend to convince myself using the [one for show, one for blow](https://habilitateblog.com/the-glorious-uselessness-of-the-pocket-handkerchief/) reasoning - but there's no excuse really it's just that sometimes I find it hard to resist.

So... what to say - I guess the only visible difference between this and the previous copy is that because the shrink-wrap is still on, so is the hype sticker that reads:

<blockquote>
<p>The Andy Warhol Museum presents Warhol's Screen Tests, available for the first time on DVD, with new soundtracks by Dean & Britta</p>
<p>"Mesmerizing"<br>
-The New York Times</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Hype sticker</p>

I thought I should look for the context of that "Mesmerizing" quote - because it isn't clear exactly _what_ the reviewer found _mesmerising_. It seems [this review](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/arts/music/20warh.html) is the source of the quote (can one word be a quote?) and is...

 - not a reference to the release (since the review is of the live show)
 - not a reference to the music
 - not a reference even to the presentation

<blockquote>
Filmed by a stationary 16-millimeter camera, these portraits, with their stark light and shadow, are, in a word, mesmerizing.
</blockquote>
<p class="caption"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/arts/music/20warh.html">For Warhol Visitors and Would-Be Superstars, 4 Minutes of Mystique</a></p>

So, it's actually describing the films, which is fine because the DVD release is of the films - and not a Dean & Britta release, they are only mentioned on the back of the case - "with new soundtracks by Dean Wareham & Britta Phillips".
