In 2008 Dean & Britta re-issued their debut album L'avventura on their own Double Feature Records, the second release the following year was the excellent Sand Pebbles compilation A Thousand Wild Flowers and Soft Core by My Robot Friend was the third.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/my-robot-friend-soft-core-23-mins.jpg" "My Robot Friend - Soft Core" %}

The album was released on CD on the 13th October 2009 and Dean added guitar to two tracks By Your Side, and Astronaut. It also includes My Robot Friend's cover of Luna's 23 Minutes in Brussels that had been released a couple of years before and that I have two copies of - one a 12", and one 7" on pink vinyl - both were bought on Discogs the 12" for £1.80 in 2016 and the 7" for 99p a couple of years ago.

As well as two copies of the 23 Minutes single I also have two copies of Soft Core, or at least I should have. I bought it when it was released (I think direct from Dean probably at the same time as A Thousand Wild Flowers) but that copy has gone AWOL - either misfiled, or perhaps found its way into a charity shop box when we moved, so I bought a replacement a couple of years back.

I don't listen to the album much but every time I do I like it much more than I expect to.

My Robot Friend has turned up elsewhere having done remixes of...

 - Dean & Britta - Say Goodnight released on [Variations](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/12/18/my-record-collection-dean-britta-variations-cd/).
 - Dean Wareham - Emancipated Hearts on the CD release of [Emancipated Hearts](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2023/01/26/my-record-collection-003-dean-wareham-emancipated-hearts/).

There is also a My Robot Friend release from 2016 called [Open the Book](https://myrobotfriend.bandcamp.com/album/open-the-book) that has Emancipated Hearts, Not a Young Man..., and also has Dean guesting on "Gone" - this was released on CD but I only have the download so won't be in this series.
