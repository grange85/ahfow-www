<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/9400848/" title="I wrote a poem on a cat biscuit by andyaldridge, on Flickr"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/6/9400848_f8732840fa.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="I wrote a poem on a cat biscuit"></a></p>
<p>Just because I had the time I decided to work on updating the <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk">A Head Full of Wishes database</a> (discography, gigography, etc.) - so far it pretty much does exactly what it used to but over the coming months I have plans to add more - but just in case you've forgotten (or was unaware) of what there was, here's a reminder...</p>
<p>A pretty full discography of <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/discography/galaxie_500">Galaxie 500</span>, <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/discography/luna" title="Luna discography">Luna</a>, <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/discography/damon_and_naomi">Damon & Naomi</span>, <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/discography/dean_and_britta">Dean & Britta</span> and <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/discography/dean_wareham">Dean Wareham</span> - still a few gaps and the pictures are a bit tiny.</p>
<p>An incomplete (but improving all the time) gigography of shows played by <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/gigography/galaxie_500">Galaxie 500</span>, <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/gigography/luna" title="Luna gigography">Luna</a>, <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/gigography/damon_and_naomi">Damon & Naomi</span>, <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/gigography/dean_and_britta">Dean & Britta</span> and <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/gigography/dean_wareham">Dean Wareham</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Some lists: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/database/guitar-chords/">A-Z of tracks with guitar chords/tab</a></li>
<li><span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/lists/albums">A-Z of albums/releases</span></li>
<li><a href="/database/tracks/">A-Z of tracks</a></li>
<li><span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/track/covers">A-Z of cover versions</span> (tracks covered by the bands rather than other bands covers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Still to do</strong><br />
Definitely...</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the above</li>
<li>Get the pictures bigger and better</li>
<li>Posters, photos and setlist scans for shows (I have a load not yet up there)</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe...</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to comment on shows, tracks, albums - I tried this before but it wasn't really taken up - but like the idea of it.</li>
<li>Ability to create a "collection" of records you have and/or shows you were at?</li>
</ul>
<p>Open to suggestions.</p>
