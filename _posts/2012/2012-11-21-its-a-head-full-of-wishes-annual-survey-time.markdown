<p>The 2012 survey has arrived - go choose your favourite Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon & Naomi and Dean & Britta albums and tracks. If you want a chance to win some of the duplicate vinyl I've accumulated over the years add your email address, otherwise everything is optional.</p>

<p>The first survey was in 1995:<br />
There was no Dean & Britta<br />
Galaxie 500's albums were still classified as "hard to find"<br />
Luna had an ex-Chill on bass and an ex-Feelie on drums<br />
Damon & Naomi... well they were still Damon & Naomi but had only released two albums</p>
