<p>After a few years of touring round both the "13 Most Beautiful" and "Dean Wareham plays Galaxie 500" projects Dean & Britta are starting to work on new albums... separately. Dean this week headed to San Francisco to start recording his first solo album with producer Jason Quever of SF indie band <a href="http://www.subpop.com/artists/papercuts">Papercuts</a>. While on the west coast Dean & Britta will be playing a couple of "plays Galaxie 500" shows at the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.hemlocktavern.com/prog_guide.php?adate_id=2012-05-11">Hemlock Tavern in San Francisco</span> on the 11 May (Friday).</p>
