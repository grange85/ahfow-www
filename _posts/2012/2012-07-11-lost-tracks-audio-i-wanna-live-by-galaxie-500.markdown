<p>I know nothing about this track... it's on a live recording I have from <a href="/database/show/1988-12-16-galaxie-500-rat-boston-ma-usa-2/">a 1988 show where Galaxie 500 were supporting The Pixies</a>.</p>
<p>I searched through the mailing list archives and all I could find was me asking if anyone knew anything about it (in 1999) -my question was answered with stony silence. Is it a cover? Google would seem to suggest otherwise, but Dean does say something, although maybe off-mic and certainly not very clear that initially sounded like it might be... now I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>Please feel free to fill in the many gaps!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I asked Dean on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fullofwishes#!/DeanWareham/posts/475603405785201?notif_t=share_comment">his Facebook page</a> about "I Wanna Live" so here's the gaps filled in...</p>
<blockquote><p> AHFoW: Hi Dean, whatever happened to I Wanna Live? Was it a cover? I keep coming across it and meaning to ask...</p>
<p>Dean: it was an original. . . a song we tried out live (apparently) but never recorded in the studio. So I guess you could say that nothing happened to it.</p></blockquote>
