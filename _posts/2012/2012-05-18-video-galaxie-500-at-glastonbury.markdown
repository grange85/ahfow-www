<p>A couple of months back a <a href="/2012/01/05/video-of-galaxie-500-at-glastonbury-in-1990/">video of some bands playing at Glastonbury in 1990</a> turned up on Dimeadozen... included were these four tracks by Galaxie 500. Look out for Kramer turning up on-stage - as mentioned in Black Postcards.</p>
<blockquote>In the middle of our third song I heard a sound behind me – it sounded like someone else was playing guitar. Kramer, He had given the house sound engineer some pointers and had quickly made his way through the crowd to the stage, where he found my spare guitar and a spare amplifier. He couldn’t resist – he was Kramer. He wanted to play the big stage at Glastonbury.
