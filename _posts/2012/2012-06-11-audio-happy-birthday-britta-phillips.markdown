<p>Happy Birthday to Britta Phillips, former Luna bassist, half of Dean & Britta, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlGFznUhrx0">singing voice of Jem</a> (of the Holograms) and the voice of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYhIZqzA-CU">Elizabeth Frankenstein</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley%27s_Frankenhole">Mary Shelley's Frankenhole</a><br />
<figure class="caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joniraundegi/536027137/" title="Dean &Britta by Jon Iraundegi (aterpeirun), on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/201/536027137_455fd66754.jpg" width="380" height="500" alt="Dean & Britta"></a><figcaption class="caption-text"></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>If memory serves these two mp3s were both on Britta's website before she joined Luna - they are two demos, one of which Your Baby obviously turned up on L'Avventura. I don't believe Daydream has been released although it did get an outing at <a href="http://rateyourmusic.com/release/unauth/britta_philips/britta_phillips_with_pete_donnelly__live_at_milkboy_/">Britta's recent solo show</a>.</p>

<p>And here's the original DVD version of I'll Keep It With Mine<br />

<p>When Flickr introduced their "Gallery" feature I threw together <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/galleries/72157622398131100/with/2965096050/lightbox/">a gallery of my favourite Britta pictures</a> - you can view that over here.</p>
<p><strong>Happy birthday Britta, have a lovely day!</strong></p>
