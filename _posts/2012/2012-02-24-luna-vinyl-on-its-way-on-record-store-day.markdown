<p>This just turned up on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dean-Wareham/331987853509795">Dean's Facebook page</a>... <del datetime="2012-02-24T16:05:49+00:00">it links to a blog post that doesn't seem to exist but I guess more details are on the way</del> <ins datetime="2012-02-24T16:05:49+00:00"><a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=1553">Blog post on Dean & Britta's website</a>.</ins></p>
<blockquote><p>
On Record Store Day (April 21, 2012) Double Feature Records will release limited edition (1,000 copies) 180-gram vinyl LPs of Lunaâ€™s Romantica and Rendezvous albums. Mastered by Scott Hull at Masterdisk, NYC, we just got test pressings in; they sound great and the images by Chas Ray Krider and Steve Ellis look beautiful too. These albums were originally on compact disc only; this is the first time they've been on vinyl.

<p>OK... found the rest of the post -<del datetime="2012-02-24T16:05:49+00:00"> I guess it'll reach the <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/">Dean & Britta blog</a> eventually</del><ins datetime="2012-02-24T16:07:33+00:00"> - post now on <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=1553">Dean & Britta's blog</a></ins> - (and probably warrants kicking some life into <a href="http://fuzzywuzzy.com/">Fuzzy Wuzzy</a>).</p>
<p>The post also mentions that Bewitched will get it's first ever vinyl release (on the <a href="http://gottagrooverecords.com/">Gotta Groove label</a>) some time this year and that a vinyl release for Penthouse is also in the works.</p>
<p>Better dig out the deck and make some room on your shelves!</p>
