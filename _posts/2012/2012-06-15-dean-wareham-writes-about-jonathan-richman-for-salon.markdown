<p>Dean has an <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/06/15/dean_wareham_my_jonathan_richman_romance/singleton/">article over at Salon</a> singing the praises of Jonathan Richman and hunting down the first Modern Lovers LP</p>
<blockquote><p>I searched every record store in New York looking for a copy of “The Modern Lovers,” released in 1976 but already deleted. And not the kind of deleted where you find it in 50 cent bins. Bleecker Bob himself laughed at me when I dared ask if he had a copy behind the counter of his shop on MacDougal Street. </p></blockquote>
<p>Read the <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/06/15/dean_wareham_my_jonathan_richman_romance/singleton/">whole article over at Salon</a> (and try not to be too offended by the awful Photoshopped stock photo they've used).</p>
<p>Also if you haven't already seen it check out my post from last month where<a href="/2012/05/16/happy-61st-birthday-jonathan-richman/"> A Head Full of Wishes wishes Jojo a happy 61st birthday</a> (complete with videos and AHFoW-related mp3s to download)</p>
