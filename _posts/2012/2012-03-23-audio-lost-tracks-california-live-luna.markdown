<p>All I know about this recording is what's written on the back of the <a href="/database/release/beautiful-view-release/">Beautiful View CD single</a> sleeve that this was released on. The track is called "California" without the usual parenthetical addendum and the sleeve informs us that it was...</p>
<blockquote><p>Recorded live and mixed by Brent Sigmeth at Pachyderm Studio, Cannon Falls, MN</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not even sure if that means that it was recorded live AND mixed or recorded live THEN mixed... There is a (small sounding) audience applauding at the end.</p>
