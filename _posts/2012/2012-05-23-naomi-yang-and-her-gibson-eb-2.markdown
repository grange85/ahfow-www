<p>Sadly Naomi hasn't brought her bass over on her last few visits to the UK - and I always got a buzz seeing it - still do - even if it has to be in pictures these days. </p>
<blockquote><p>It always seemed to me that equipment lists were the best thing about [<em>Guitar Player</em>]! On a practical and aesthetic level, as a musician, your equipment is an important issue to you - your choices define your aesthetic statement. But listing equipment is kind of a macho thing [...] </p>
<p>There's a whole mentality that prevails [at music stores] [...] There's a "who knows more about equipment| game that's played.</p>
<p>When I went shopping for that bass I had no idea how to play - so I used purely visual criteria. I chose the most beautiful bass in the store [...] I was lucky; in choosing one that was unique looking , I also ended up with one that had a very warm, natural, <em>old</em> sound.</p></blockquote>
<p>Naomi interviewed in Andrea Juno's mid 90s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0965104206/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0965104206">Angry Women in Rock</a></p>
<p>There were (at least) two basses - a sunburst one and the cherry red one - here you can see both in action:</p>
