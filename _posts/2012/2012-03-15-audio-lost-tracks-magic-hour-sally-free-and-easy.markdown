<p>Magic Hour were the psych rock band that Damon & Naomi formed with Kate Biggar and Wayne Rogers of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystalized_Movements">Crystalized Movements</a> (and <a href="http://www.twistedvillage.com/">Twisted Village</a>) after More Sad Hits. The band released three albums and a couple of singles between 1993 and 1996. Sally Free and Easy, from the band's <a href="/database/release/no-excess-is-absurd-magic-hour/">first album</a>, is the only Magic Hour song that was sung by Naomi and because of that, and because it was gentler and sweeter and folkier than a lot of Magic Hour's output, it could have just as easily fitted onto a Damon & Naomi album.</p>
<p>The song was written by English folk-singer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Tawney">Cyril Tawney</a> in the 1950s and has been covered by pretty close to everyone, from Davy Graham, The Pentangle and Bob Dylan to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpDlxkLV5ZY">Flying Saucer Attack</a> and a very <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpD0GGJ9D5E">wonderful version by Trees</a>.</p>
<p>Magic Hour's version is up there with the best and it's a shame that it has been mostly lost to Damon & Naomi's past (Magic Hour don't even have a Wikipedia page... I should fix that some time!)</p>
