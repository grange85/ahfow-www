<p>Five years ago <a href="/2007/08/28/on-the-20th-anniversary-of-galaxie-500/">I took it upon myself to declare Galaxie 500's birthday as being the 29 August 1987</a>, you can read my full argument for that date <a href="/2007/08/28/on-the-20th-anniversary-of-galaxie-500/">over here</a> but in short that was the date that the trio of Dean, Damon & Naomi first played to an audience at an apartment in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=248+front+st+new+york&ll=40.708127,-74.000883&spn=0.005148,0.007553&sll=40.708207,-74.001013&layer=c&cbp=13,271.89,,0,-10.73&cbll=40.708127,-74.000883&hnear=248+Front+St,+New+York,+10038&t=m&z=17&panoid=2cC3_xqC2_gZtSrtfuZPIA">Front St NYC</a>.</p>
<p>Nobody chose to argue with me at the time although Dean subsequently undercut me a little in Black Postcards a year later...</p>
<blockquote><p>Galaxie 500 was born the day that Naomi volunteered to play the bass guitar [...] we had our first rehearsal on May 27, 1987</p></blockquote>
<p>so I may have to concede that I should have put this post together three months ago.</p>
<p>However, while my argument that "it’s when you invite others to judge you that defines when a band is truly born" might be nonsense it is <em>my nonsesne</em> and I can publish it on <em>my website</em> with a fair amount of impunity. </p>
<p>Having made my declaration five years ago - I'll stand by it... for now.</p>
<blockquote><p>The first ever Galaxie 500 show was during the summer of 1987 at my apartment on Front St. in Manhattan. We played 4 or 5 songs, I can’t remember what they were, but I remember being pleased that I didn’t break any strings. I was working in the Elmer Holmes Bobst Memorial Library at N.Y.U. Damon & Naomi were in town for the summer, and Naomi had decided to pick up the bass guitar – I guess that’s when the band was born for real.<br />
<em>(Dean Wareham – Box set booklet)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So take your pick:<br />
27 May 1987 - first rehearsal<br />
11 August 1987 - first demo recorded<br />
29 August 1987 - first show</p>
<p>but whichever one you choose it means that we're at Galaxie 500's 25th anniversary - their silver anniversary... <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22389419@N08/7035682145/">silver Galaxie 500</a>. </p>
<p>Here's a collection of complete live shows I've shared over recent years - plus a couple I've not shared before. Enjoy them and raise a glass or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laurenrosenbaum/2406358388/">eat a twinkie</a> in their honour:</p>

<p>OK...

<p>Just in case the title of this post is meaningless... this is what pops into my head every time anyone says "25 years"...<br />
