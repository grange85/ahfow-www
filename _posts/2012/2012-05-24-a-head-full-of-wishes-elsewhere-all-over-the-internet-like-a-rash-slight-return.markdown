<p>Not done this for a while so... a little plug for where else you can find A Head Full of Wishes out there on the 'net...</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fullofwishes">A Head Full of Wishes Facebook page</a> is growing and while it's not quite buzzing with activity it ticks over rather nicely - getting close to 900 "likes" - while I'm not one to put much store by these numbers still nice to see that there's still an interest.</p>
<p>A Head Full of Wishes is also <a href="http://twitter.com/ahfow">on Twitter as @ahfow</a> - mostly it's just links to stuff I find and stuff post - if you want more discussion you can also (or alternatively) choose to follow me - <a href="http://twitter.com/grange85">@grange85</a> - but you will have to put up with all the other nonsense I spout!</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fullofwishes">The Mailing list</a> is very quiet these days - it'll have the occasional spurt of activity (and it's lovely when it does) and if I was a better caretaker I'd take better care of it. Come join us anyway!</p>
<p>There are a few releavant groups on Flickr:<br />
The main one <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/aheadfullofwishes/">called (surprisingly) A Head Full of Wishes</a> has close to 700 pictures in its pool and is growing constantly.<br />
There's my failed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1109080@N20/">A Fashion Parade of Wishes</a> - where folk (mostly me) can share pictures of them in their AHFoW related fashion (T-shirts) - just 19 pictures.<br />
There's also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/677374@N21/">You Turned My Head Around</a> which catches pictures of Britta at a certain moment in a certain song - 38 pictures, but it's been out of the setlist for a while.<br />
The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/92643213@N00/">Galaxie</a> group - that wasn't set up by me but was set up for "any excuse to name a photo after a Galaxie 500 song, or for that matter Luna and similar/related music" finally succumbed almost entirely to photos of cars... except when I belligerently post a picture!</p>
<p>I've also set up a <a href="http://pinterest.com/grange85/a-head-full-of-wishes/">Pinterest board</a> to post some of the more quirky (or plain awesome) pictures I find.</p>
<p>I also run the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/galaxie500official">official Galaxie 500 page on MySpace</a> but have to admit that I mostly don't - but I let myself off because Damon & Naomi asked me to run it but they've not been updating their MySpace page either!</p>
<p>If you just want links you can keep an eye on <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:grange85/t:ahfow/">my ahfow tag on Pinboard</a> which I use to manage my links.</p>
