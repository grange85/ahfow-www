<blockquote><p> Stanley drove into town, and we jammed together in the basement of Byron's apartment... We played "Slash Your Tires" one of the songs we had been playing with Byron. All of a sudden we sounded ten times better. We were no longer an underpowered train, struggling to climb a hill. Stanley was like a judicious metronome, a machine.<br />
