<blockquote><p>This is the first time Luna's Bewitched has ever been pressed on vinyl!<br />
TEST PRESSING CONTEST -- 50 randomly selected pre-orders will receive a test pressing copy of this record in lieu of the final pressing! </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The record features the cover art and photography (by Michael Lavine and Laurie Henzel) which the band had intended for the release, but which was replaced at the last minute when the original CD version was released. </p></blockquote>
