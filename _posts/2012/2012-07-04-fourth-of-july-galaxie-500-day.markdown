<p>Every so often I get an idea to have a Fourth of July game because for me the Fourth of July is <em>Galaxie 500 Day</em> although these games tend to have few players (although the ones that that do play produce gems) - I guess partly because of the half-baked idea for a game and partly because apparently <em>Galaxie 500 Day</em> conflicts with some other national holiday (not over here it doesn't - I'll be at work!)...</p>
<p>Anyway... if anyone wants to play along the rules are to produce something that is somehow connected with <a href="/database/track/25/">Galaxie 500's Fourth of July</a> for example...</p>
<ul>
<li>A poem, on a dog biscuit</li>
<li>Proof that the Empire State Building is no bigger than a nickel</li>
<li>A lonely bed-in</li>
<li>Or anything else that you feel inspired by</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few submissions from the past:</p>
<p>Simon submitted this sweet narrative song:</p>
<div class="flower_soundplayer"><strong>MP3: <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/audio/clares-club-fourth-of-july-still-playsiin-my-heart.mp3">The Fourth of July Still Plays in My Heart</a></strong></div>
<p>Paul sent in this photo of dog decidedly not interested in a poem on a dog biscuit<br />
</p>
<p>Ro proved that a nickel is in fact bigger than the Empire State Building<br />
