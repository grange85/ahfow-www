<p>There's a fairly lengthy Q&A with Dean Wareham over at The Village VOice blog - he touches on playing Galaxie 500 sets, Black Postcards, the Dean Wareham solo album and playing with Sean Eden (<a href="/2012/07/20/dean-britta-shows-in-ny-this-weekend/">which is happening tonight</a>)...</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>VV: </strong>What are the chances of you playing again with Sean happening?<br />
<strong>DW: </strong>Well, you know what, we're actually—we're not talking about a Luna reunion or anything—but we're playing this benefit on Long Island [tomorrow night] and Sean is going to play like four or five songs with us. So, we see him; we're still on good terms. I wouldn't rule out that we'd play shows together or something.</p></blockquote>
