<p>Here's Luna's cover of Waiting on a Friend originally released by The Rolling Stones on what is maybe their last mostly listenable album Tattoo You - well I bought the next one Undercover and it was awful and never bought another so I guess I don't really know for sure, although Dean agrees (see below).)<br />

<p>Here's <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.splendidezine.com/features/luna2/">Dean being interviewed by Splendi</span>d...</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Splendid</strong>: The Rolling Stones, for instance.<br />
<strong>Dean Wareham</strong>: Well, they made at least nine good records... but they haven't made a good record since...<br />
<strong>Splendid</strong>: 1982?<br />
<strong>Dean Wareham</strong>: Yeah. So twenty years of making sucky records.<br />
<strong>Splendid</strong>: And perhaps they're entitled to some of that, but it's still not fair to the rest of us.<br />
<strong>Dean Wareham</strong>: Hopefully we can age gracefully.
