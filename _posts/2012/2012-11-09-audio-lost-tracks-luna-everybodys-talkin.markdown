In 1998 Sub Pop decided to revive their Singles Club, so Singles Club V2 arrived with offerings from Jesus and Mary Chain, Modest Mouse, Ron Sexsmith... and Luna. If memory serves the singles arrived in twos (rather than monthly) so it would have been in the second mailing sometime in the summer of that year that <a href="/database/index.php/database/discography/luna/66">Luna's version of Fred Neil's Everybody's Talkin'</a> arrived in my life as a transparent yellow disc of plastic.<br />

That version of the song is available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00122K2NA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00122K2NA&linkCode=as2&tag=aheadfullofwi-20">Lunafied</a> and the two-disc edition of Best of Luna. I've shared the flip of that single previously, <a href="/2011/10/07/audio-friday-recycling-luna-with-sterling-morrison-great-jones-street/">right at the bottom of this post about Great Jones Street</a>.</p>
<p>In September of 1998 Luna scheduled a tour of Australia and to coincide with the tour an <a href="/database/index.php/database/discography/luna/67">EP was pressed by Aussie label Shock</a>. The EP had the album version of Tracy I Love You along with some radio sessions including one from 1997 that Luna did for KCRW in which they played a cover of Everybody's Talkin'.</p>
