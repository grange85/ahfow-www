This is an audience recording of Galaxie 500's first _non-secret_ London show that has been well covered on this site before...

This was one of the earliest cassettes that I was sent probably close to 30 years ago, and I'll use that as an excuse for not being able to thank who sent it to me, although it was definitely the same person who sent me a recording of [Galaxie 500's Camden Falcon show](/2024/05/06/my-record-collection-133-galaxie-500-camden-the-falcon-11-02-90-mc/) that I've already written about in this series. It was almost certainly someone on this side of the pond since they haven't used an insane dating system. If it was you thanks... again!

When I pulled this cassette out I noticed (and must have noticed before) that it also has a recording of Luna playing the Forum in London while supporting The Velvet Underground in 1993. I hadn't digitised it and it didn't seem to be _out there_ so... it is now - on bittorrent site Dimeadozen. I posted about that show a couple of weeks back...

 - [Audio: Luna in London supporting The Velvet Underground](/2025/10/08/audio-luna-in-london-supporting-the-velvet-underground/)

The recording cuts in midway through the first song of the set... funnily enough, I was late to the gig and also arrived midway through Luna's first song.

For those who don't or can't get torrent files I've also [zipped up the whole show and popped it on Mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/file/kwsa25xn0pqhvak/luna-1993-06-05-the-forum-london-uk-flac.zip/file).
