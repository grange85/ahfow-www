This is a CD that came with the [VHS I posted about earlier](/2025/08/11/my-record-collection-galaxie-500-live-compilation-vhs/) and a couple of posters. It contains studio outtakes, or unedited studio takes most of which has now been released, either on the first [Uncollected](/database/galaxie-500/releases/uncollected/#uncollected) or the more recent [Uncollected Noise New York](/2024/10/08/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-09-and-10-galaxie-500-uncollected-noise-new-york-88-90/) releases. Previously I had most/all of this [on a cassette](/2023/08/17/my-record-collection-061-galaxie-500-unreleased-sessions-and-live-at-the-rat/).

There is a live version of It's Getting Late tagged on the end but even that has now had an official release, it being from the [CBGBs show that recently got released](/2025/08/14/my-record-collection-galaxie-500-cbgb-13th-december-1988/).

The one, as yet still unreleased, gem is the fast version of Ceremony that I have shared before, but always nice to hear it again. I think this was recorded when they went into Noise New York to record demos for Slash Records in February 1989... I know somewhere Dean mentions the fast version in an interview/article/book but I haven't tracked down where that was.

There are also non-album versions of Pictures and Flowers. The cassette I mention above suggests that _Shout You Down_, _Can't Believe It's Me_, and _See Through Glasses_ were from December 1987, but I can't find any evidence to support that, and the Noise New York Uncollected dates them to February 1988.

Full tracklist:

 - Walking Song (August 1987)
 - On The Floor (August 1987)
 - The Other Side (August 1987)
 - Shout You Down (February 1988)
 - Can't Believe It's Me (February 1988)
 - See Thru Glasses (February 1988)
 - Song in 3 (July 1988)
 - Jerome (July 1988)
 - Ceremony (February 1989)
 - I Will Walk (February 1989)
 - Pictures (probably July 1988)
 - Flowers (probably July 1988)
 - It's Getting Late (live at CBGB's 13th December 1988)

OK - that all became a bit nerdy... and has me ready to start to document Galaxie 500's recording sessions... next project!
