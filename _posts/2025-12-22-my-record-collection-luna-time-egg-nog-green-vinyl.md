This is my second copy of Luna's promo/christmas 7" from 1992, this is the green vinyl version and, like the red vinyl copy came in a generic Elektra sleeve.

Last time out, for the [red vinyl version](http://moonshot.local:4040/2023/12/18/my-record-collection-096-luna-time-egg-nog-red-vinyl/) of Luna's Christmas single from 1992 I debated whether or not it really was a Christmas single - I don't think I came to a firm decision either way but one piece of evidence I missed was what Dean wrote about Egg Nog in the sleeve notes for [Best of Luna](http://moonshot.local:4040/2006/09/05/best-of-luna-european-release/).

<blockquote>
Elektra asked us to record a Christmas single in 1992. Justin had written a little instrumental that he thought might work - all we had to do was add sleigh bells and give it a Christmas-y title. This was our first recording session as a quartet, Sean having joined the band about a month earlier. These sessions took place at Mixolydian Studios in Boonton, New Jersey, with Feelies' engineer Don Sternecker recording and mixing. Over the course of two days we recorded "Indian Summer", "Ride Into the Sun", "That's What You Always Say" and "Egg Nog". Sean's playing was stellar, and for the first time Luna felt like a band.

So, it seems that Egg Nog existed _before_ it was turned into`a Christmas song with the addition of seasonal percussion and an appropriate title.

I don't really remember Egg Nog as being a _thing_ over this side of the pond, or at least not in our house - my mum was rather fond of a [Snowball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_(cocktail)) which was made with [Advocat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocaat) which is I guess a nog-ish beverage, and was certainly more likely to be drunk at Christmas - but the fizzy addition of lemonade took it quite a distance from Egg Nog.

Back in 2017 I decided to make an Egg Nog and made the mistake of handing my phone/Instgram account to the boy

It became a bit of a tradition, you can watch the [2019 #eggnoglive over here](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17857527670713967/) - the look on my face as I took a sip shows that I'm clearly not a drinker!
