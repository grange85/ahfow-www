This is my second copy of Luna's promo/christmas 7" from 1992, this is the green vinyl version and, like the red vinyl copy came in a generic Elektra sleeve.

Last time out, for the [red vinyl version](/2023/12/18/my-record-collection-096-luna-time-egg-nog-red-vinyl/) of Luna's Christmas single from 1992 I debated whether or not it really was a Christmas single - I don't think I came to a firm decision either way but one piece of evidence I missed was what Dean had written about Egg Nog in the sleeve notes for [Best of Luna](/2006/09/05/best-of-luna-european-release/).

<blockquote>
Elektra asked us to record a Christmas single in 1992. Justin had written a little instrumental that he thought might work - all we had to do was add sleigh bells and give it a Christmas-y title. This was our first recording session as a quartet, Sean having joined the band about a month earlier. These sessions took place at Mixolydian Studios in Boonton, New Jersey, with Feelies' engineer Don Sternecker recording and mixing. Over the course of two days we recorded "Indian Summer", "Ride Into the Sun", "That's What You Always Say" and "Egg Nog". Sean's playing was stellar, and for the first time Luna felt like a band.

So, it seems that Egg Nog existed _before_ it was turned into a Christmas song with the addition of seasonal percussion and an appropriate title.

I don't really remember Egg Nog (the drink) as being a _thing_ over this side of the pond, or at least not in our house - my mum was rather fond of a [Snowball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_(cocktail)) which was made with [Advocaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocaat) which is I guess a nog-ish beverage, and was certainly more likely to be drunk at Christmas - but the fizzy addition of lemonade took it quite a distance from Egg Nog.

Back in 2017 I decided to make an Egg Nog and made the mistake of handing my phone/Instgram account to the boy

It became a bit of a tradition, you can watch the [2019 #eggnoglive over here](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17857527670713967/) - the look on my face as I took a sip shows that I'm clearly not a drinker!

A couple of weeks back we were watching the 1938 film [Four Daughters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Daughters_(1938_film)) and were confronted by this little bit of dialogue...

    "Oh come along, let's have some Tom and Jerry"

Which led to some Googling and the revelation that a _Tom and Jerry_ is an egg nog variant that, according to Wikipedia, is served hot so we might give that a go this Christmas!

... and that is enough of [my record collection](/category/my-record-collection/) for 2025 (102 posts!) - if you celebrate have a lovely Xmas, if you don't celebrate I hope you make it through to 2026 relatively unscathed! All being well the next post in the series will be on 5th January... but there'll likely be more from me before then.

 - While I can't remember how the red copy came into my possession, this copy was definitely an eBay purchase since it has a nice hand-written note from the seller tucked into the sleeve.
