The show was recorded for posterity and released on a limited edition cassette by Sonic Cathedral and a photograph of the show from my position was used on the sleeve. There are more of my [pictures from the show on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/albums/72157632080412568/with/8209836725/).
