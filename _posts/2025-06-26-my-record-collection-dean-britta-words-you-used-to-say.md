This lovely little EP was released by Dean & Britta in October 2006 a few months ahead of the release of Back Numbers, and as well as the album version of Words You Used to Say has four fantastic cover versions, some of my favourite D&B covers. This was Dean's first post-Luna release a full eighteen months after the split. That was a long wait.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/dean-and-britta-words-you-used-to-say-ep.jpg" "Dean & Britta - Words You Used to Say" %}

 - {% ahfowtrack "We're Not Supposed to be Lovers" %} is by Adam Green and from his second solo album Friends of Mine - Dean & Britta's cover made it's first appearance on their MySpace page before appearing on this EP - this, like the album was produced by Tony Visconti.
 - {% ahfowtrack "Since I Lay My Burden Down" %} is by Michael Holland (of Jennyanykind) and was first released on his Tomorrow's American Treasures album - Dean & Britta's cover was mixed by Sonic Boom and has a guitar solo by Kev Cowan (formerly of The Darkside).
 - {% ahfowtrack "Colours" %} is by Donavan - Colours was one of the songs that I learned to play from my first "learn to play guitar" book about a billion years ago. I'm not sure I could play it now which means I'm a worse guitarist now than I was when I was about 13 (actually that's not a surprise because I so rarely pick up the guitar these days and I was never really any good).
 - {% ahfowtrack "Distractions, Pt. 1" %} is I think my absolute favourite Dean cover, I love it so much - it's a cover of a Bobby Darin song from his 1969 album Commitment. when I first heard it I wrote this to the mailing list:  
 "Distractions is funny - I mean it's surely Dean making excuses for taking so long with this album - and frankly ogling your naked neighbours is not a good enough excuse." This was also produced by Tony Visconti.

The only downside to this release is that I'm not that keen on the sleeve, I like the typography, and even the colour - just Dean and Britta look so grim...!

Oddly, this EP made up side four of last year's [L'avventura Record Store Day re-release](/2024/04/26/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-16-dean-britta-l-avventura-rsd-2024/), even though they date from Back Numbers - I mean Words You Used to Say is actually *on* Back Numbers as well as the L'avventura re-release!
