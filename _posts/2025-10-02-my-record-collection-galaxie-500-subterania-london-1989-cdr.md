Back in 2012, Lori got in touch with me and over the course of a few weeks sent me some absolutely lovely Galaxie 500 _stuff_ - some of which I wrote about in [a previous post](/2023/03/23/my-record-collection-019-galaxie-500-winkles-bedford-soundcheck-december-1989-cdr/) in this series. A few weeks later this CDR of Galaxie 500's show at Subterania in London in 1989 arrived.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-subterania-1989-cdr.jpg" "CDR of Galaxie 500 at Subterania in 1989" %}

I was, for a while I was sure I was at this gig but from Lori's description and listening to the show I'm now fairly certain I wasn't - although, given that Subterania was a local venue, and I was already a fan by late 1989 I'm genuinely surprised that I wasn't.

Support band for the show was Ride and BBC TV show Snub were there taping some of the show and it's the source of Galaxie 500's TV appearance on SNUB TV a month later being interviewed and playing Snowstorm. [Ride's performance of Drive Blind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1FZjgggSFE) was also on the show.

In her email Lori suggested that the show was "better than the Copenhagen live cd" and it is certainly a great recording, and sounds like it was a great show, although the punter relentlessly pleading for Tugboat might have got a little tiresome, certainly the band were probably getting a bit tired of it, and certainly some of the audience.

Now shortly after I received the CDR I was contacted by a friend of Lori, Josef K who filled me in a bit on the recording and ended his email with this cryptic nugget - "'Tugboat' is included on the copy of Subterania [...], but I didn't list it - you'll know why as you were at the gig!"

BUT! As it turns out I wasn't at the gig so have never found out the "why" and Josef never replied to my enquiry. If anyone knows I'd love to find out!

I'm not sure how widely this has been shared, Josef said he was planning to put it on DIME, but I'm not sure if that ever happened. I've [popped the flacs on MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/file/cr1iwn5jnzjhd67/galaxie-500-1989-12-13-subterania-flac.zip/file) if you're interested, and if my free MediaFire account can cope.
