In September 2019 Luna announced the release of this "quasi-bootleg" LP of tracks recorded on their (so called) farewell tour in 2004/5. The LP was to be a limited release of 750 individually numbered copies and would be sold on their autumn tour of the US before flogging the left-overs online. My copy is #695.

Side A has tracks from various shows of the final tour while side B is a selection from their final shows at The Bowery Ballroom.

The album is titled, and designed, to match the DVD _rockumentary_ Tell Me Do You Miss Me - the title of course being a lyric from 23 Minutes in Brussels, which was the closing song on the DVD but is actually not included on this LP. This is of course fine because the LP finishes with Fuzzy Wuzzy which is one of Luna's finest live songs!

So... just because, here's a list of what are currently my top five favourite live Luna songs&dagger;: _(most of which aren't on this LP)_

1. Fuzzy Wuzzy
2. Indian Summer _because a Luna show doesn't feel finished if they haven't finished it with this!_
3. Time to Quit
4. Black Postcards _which is so much better live than the LP version_
5. 23 Minutes in Brussels _becasue it would be churlish to ignore this_

Dean gave away a download of Black Postcards in his newletter back then and said _"attached to this email is the exciting (to me, anyway) 9-minute version of "Black Postcards" that appears on the album"_

Here's the full live version of _Black Postcards_ from the TMDYMM DVD just to show why it became one of my faves.
