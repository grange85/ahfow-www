Tell Me Do You Miss Me was Matthew Buzzell's wonderful 'rockumentary' of Luna's farewell tour, it was premiered at the Tribeca film festival in April 2006 and the US DVD followed a couple of months later. This DVD for fans outside the US finally arrived three months after that US release.

The DVD contains:

 - The film with a stereo and a 5.1 mix, and also a commentary with the band and director Matthew Buzzell.
 - Full performances of
   - Friendly Advice
   - Cindy Tastes of Barbecue
   - Bewitched
   - Black Postcards
 - A stack of "deleted scenes" which I suspect mostly weren't really deleted but ... leftovers
 - And an Easter Egg of Sean singing what appears to be a song called "[Matthew is a Cock](https://youtu.be/1u2XX5ybWSE)"!?

The bonus performance of Black Postcards is breathtaking. I think Black Postcards was the surprise high of Luna's farewell performances and so to include it in all its glory on the DVD was definitely a wise move!

I've seen the film on the big screen twice, although both times digitally projected from the DVD, and neither time in a cinema.

1. The film got its [UK premiere at the Half Moon in Herne Hill](/2009/12/22/review-uk-premiere-of-tell-me-do-you-miss-me/), the actual premiere was scheduled for October, postponed, and finally happened on a cold, cold evening just before Christmas in 2009. It was sadly rather poorly attended which was a shame. It was followed by The Dream Machine All Stars performing some Luna gems.
2. The film was then [presented at The Social in London's West End](/2019/06/22/a-tribute-to-luna-and-dean-wareham/), at the launch of Luna's entry in the Sonic Cathedral Singles Club. Again, not particularly well attended, astonishing considering the [special guest DJ set](/2023/06/08/my-record-collection-041-luna-something-in-the-air/)! It was followed by Daniel Land, Ben Phillipson and Buffalo Postcard performing some Luna gems.
