Dean & Britta's 13 Most Beautiful probably wins on for the most different formats in this series... this one is the LP version that was released by Danish indie Wouldn't Waste Records in 2017.

{% ahfowimage "url" "caption" %}

This LP finds the 13 tracks spread over three sides of vinyl and this one *almost*  matches the single CD version that was originally released in 2011 on Dean and Britta's Double Feature Records. Only _almost_ because the CD had an unlisted extra track, the Scott Hardkiss remix of _Not a Young Man Anymore_.

Previously the collection was released as...

 - A DVD in 2009 for $30 - [My record collection #139](/2024/05/02/my-record-collection-132-13-most-beautiful-dvd/) and [My record collection #169](/2024/08/15/my-record-collection-162-13-most-beautiful-songs-for-andy-warhol-s-screen-tests-dvd/)
 - A deluxe DVD in 2009 for $250 - I couldn't afford this one!
 - A double CD collection in 2010 - [My record collection #104](/2024/01/08/my-record-collection-099-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-2xcd/) and [My record collection #180](/2024/09/23/my-record-collection-173-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-2xcd/)
 - A limited edition single CD in with 14 tracks 2011 [My record collection #224](/2025/02/17/my-record-collection-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-pink-cd/)

The 14 track single CD version is [also available to download](https://deanandbritta.bandcamp.com/album/13-most-beautiful-songs-for-andy-warhols-screen-tests), Dean did claim in a recent newsletter that "this sequence of the album follows the live show we performed" but it doesn't because I'm pretty certain the live shows always started with _Richard Rheem Theme_ (although apart from that it was in sequence).

Anyway... the LP is a lovely package (although sadly not in a gatefold sleeve) and comes with a nice card insert with a slightly edited version of the notes first included with the double CD version back in 2010.

I've been lucky enough to see Dean & Britta perform 13 Most Beautiful twice, first time the UK premiere at [The Carnegie Hall in Dunfermline](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2009/07/09/13-most-beautiful-at-the-carnegie-hall-in-dunfermline/) in 2009, and then the London premiere at The Barbican in 2010 - both were exceptional but The Carnegie Hall show was the most memorable.
