This is the sixth and (so far) final apparace of Dean & Britta's 13 Most Beautiful which probably wins for the most different formats in this series... this one is the LP version that was released by Danish indie Wouldn't Waste Records in 2017.

This LP finds the 13 tracks spread over three sides of vinyl and this one *almost*  matches the single CD version that was originally released in 2011 on Dean and Britta's Double Feature Records. Only _almost_ because the CD had an unlisted extra track, the Scott Hardkiss remix of _Not a Young Man Anymore_.

Previously the collection was released as...

 - A DVD in 2009 for $30 - [My record collection #139](/2024/05/02/my-record-collection-132-13-most-beautiful-dvd/) and [My record collection #169](/2024/08/15/my-record-collection-162-13-most-beautiful-songs-for-andy-warhol-s-screen-tests-dvd/)
 - A deluxe DVD in 2009 for $250 - I couldn't afford this one!
 - A double CD collection in 2010 - [My record collection #104](/2024/01/08/my-record-collection-099-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-2xcd/) and [My record collection #180](/2024/09/23/my-record-collection-173-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-2xcd/)
 - A limited edition single CD in with 14 tracks 2011 [My record collection #224](/2025/02/17/my-record-collection-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-pink-cd/)

The 14 track single CD version is [also available to download](https://deanandbritta.bandcamp.com/album/13-most-beautiful-songs-for-andy-warhols-screen-tests), Dean did claim in a recent newsletter that "this sequence of the album follows the live show we performed" but it doesn't because I'm pretty certain the live shows always started with _Richard Rheem Theme_ (although apart from that it was in sequence).

Anyway... the LP is a lovely package (although sadly not in a gatefold sleeve) and comes with a nice card insert with a slightly edited version of the notes first included with the double CD version back in 2010. A slightly different version of the sleeve notes were [published in Bomb Magazine in 2009](https://bombmagazine.org/articles/2009/06/21/scoring-warhol-s-screen-tests/).

I've been lucky enough to see Dean & Britta perform 13 Most Beautiful twice, first time the UK premiere at [The Carnegie Hall in Dunfermline](/2009/07/09/13-most-beautiful-at-the-carnegie-hall-in-dunfermline/) in 2009, and then the [London premiere at The Barbican in 2010](/2010/07/31/review-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-the-barbican-london/) - both were exceptional but The Carnegie Hall show was the most special, and memorable.
