If you placed an order for the Luna live albums that Bandbox put up for sale a couple of years back, you can now, finally, get some resolution. 

Vinylbox are honouring the orders if you're happy to pay a shipping and handling charge.

The fulfillment company are based in the UK and the charge is în GBP and is £11.29 although I believe the US orders will be shipped from the US.

To make a claim you will need to [fill in an online form](https://luna.bandbox.sucks/LRwgkN) and will need your Bandbox order number and the last four digits of the card you used (PayPal orders are also accommodated).

I filled in the form and got an invoice within an hour and it all seemed to go smoothly, although I'll confirm that when I have the records! 

Hopefully this frustrating debacle is finally coming to an end.
