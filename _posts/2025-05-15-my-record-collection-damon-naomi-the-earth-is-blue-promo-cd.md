This is the promo of Damon & Naomi's sixth&dagger; album that Damon sent to me ahead of the release, along with the album's 'press materials'.

Now, I do love a press release because it involves someone having to write words about things that really need to be listened to - and those words then need to convert into press coverage, and thence to sales. What a ridiculous thing to have to do! It's the exact opposite of reviews or criticism. This PR however has resisted trying to describe the actual songs short of an overview:

<blockquote>
This release expands their sound and vision of modern pop music. Delicate harmonies and intricate melodic lines dominate the albums ten tracks
</blockquote>

Instead the PR reproduces the album's lyrics and has a short biography with fairly restrained floweriness:

<blockquote>
<p>The duo are artists in the most fully expressed sense of the word. With a new album, The Earth Is Blue, set for release in February of 2005, Damon & Naomi have cho-sen to take control of all aspects of their music and put the record out themselves. The album marks a new epoch in the wondrous world of Damon & Naomi, and is a stunning work to behold.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Nothing proves that more than The Earth Is Blue, their first album of new material in five years. Informed by their various experiences, both traveling the world and listening to and reading the greatest of human achievements, Damon & Naomi have created an album of worldly beauty and individual intimacy. The songs are smart and perceptive without forgoing a wide-eyed wonder at the many things there are to experience and learn.</p>
</blockquote>

And, nothing said is actually wrong - the album _is_ "a stunning work to behold" and _is_ "an album of worldly beauty" ... it might be their best album, and even if not that, it is certainly their most beautiful album.

I don't seem to get sent press releases any more, maybe they're no longer a thing. I miss them though, the beautiful ones (like this one) as well as [the hilarious ones](/2025/04/03/my-record-collection-luna-pup-tent-cd/)
