<p>Britta is interviewed about music and politics on pinkomag.com</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Pinko: So what’s up next from Dean & Britta?</em><br />
Britta: We have a few shows coming up at The Zipper Factory in NYC on July 24th, August 21st and September 20th. The Zipper Factory is an old zipper factory on W. 37th St. It only holds about 200 people and it’s seated (the seats are old car seats). We’re thinking of having different themes for each show (maybe all Galaxie 500 songs for one, our first album, “L’Avventura” for another, covers…??)</p></blockquote>
