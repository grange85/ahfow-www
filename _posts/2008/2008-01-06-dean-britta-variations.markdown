<p>Dean & Britta have a download only EP coming out soon that features a number of remixes of tracks from their Back Numbers album (and one new track) by Sonic Boom, Sand Pebbles, Richard Formby, My Robot Friend amongst others. You can <a href="http://www.myspace.com/deanandbritta  ">hear the Scott Hardkiss remix of Singer Sing on their MySpace page</a>.</p>
<p>The EP will be released on the 29 January and will be <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011UQA2K?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0011UQA2K">available from Amazon</span> (where you can currently here short previews of all the tracks).
