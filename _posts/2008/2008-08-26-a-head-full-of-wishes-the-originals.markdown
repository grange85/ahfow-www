<p>A few years back I started a project of putting up mp3s of tracks that Galaxie 500, Luna etc. had covered - the idea was that folk like us who had no idea as to how the original "Listen, the Snow Is Falling" sounded could find out - instead it just seemed to be a way for the world to download more Lennon, Dylan and Donovan tracks as the tracks in the "Originals" series were downloaded many times more than the other mp3s I uploaded.</p>
<p>I still think that it's an interesting idea and, in a lot of cases, a nice introduction to some of the music that influenced the bands I loved so I've taken the opportunity to create a last.fm playlist for you all to enjoy...</p>
<p>I suspect that a lot of tracks I've added won't actually be on last.fm's servers and there is the problem of the "originals" not really being originals at all (e.g. the version of Bonnie and Clyde on last.fm is a very dodgy live reggae version rather than the one of the Initials B.B. album) - that and the danger of hearing the original "Straight Up" or "Sweet Child..." when the cover is so far superior...</p>
<p>But anyway last.fm users .<span class="removed_link" title="http://www.last.fm/user/grange85/library/playlists/1xb8s_a_head_full_of_wishes_-_the_originals">head over here</span> to listen (non last.fm folk will probably need to sign up (for free) to  hear it) - please leave shouts so I can get the idea that I haven't wasted the evening doing this when I ought to have been doing something more useful...</p>
