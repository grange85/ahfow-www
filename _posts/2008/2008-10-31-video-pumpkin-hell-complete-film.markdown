<p>As a Hallowe'en treat I was going to hunt down and repost the trailer for Pumpkin Hell - the short film that Dean Wareham made last year, so I skipped off to the <span class="removed_link" title="http://finneranfilms.com/Site/Home.html">film's official website</span> and discovered that the <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1454928837/bctid1701198733">complete film was being streamed at the IFC website</a>. So now, instead of the one minute trailer you were going to, get you can head off and enjoy the full 20 minutes of Dean's performance as Mick the proprieter of a pumpkin patch left to babysit Terry after his father goes AWOL.</p>
<p>Happy Hallowe'en</p>
<p><a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1454928837/bctid1701198733">Visit IFC.com to view Pumpkin Hell</a></p>
<p>If you don't have 20 minutes to kill I guess you can still <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=753xFEpyu2Q">enjoy the trailer</a>...</p>
