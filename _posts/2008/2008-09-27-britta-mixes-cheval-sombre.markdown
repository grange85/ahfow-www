<p>Britta Phillips has provided a mix of a track by New York based act <a href="http://www.myspace.com/chevalsombre">Cheval Sombre</a> that will be released on their upcoming CD and 7" single on Irish indie <a href="http://www.trensmat.com/tr012.html">Trensmat Records</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Britta Phillips, once of Luna and currently of Dean & Britta, provides a remix of 'Troubled Mind' which creates a bleary cloudy atmosphere which is brilliantly broken and carries along with a languid bluesy swagger. Absolutely, perfectly gorgeous.</p></blockquote>
<p>The limited edition release is available to pre-order on the <a href="http://www.trensmat.com/tr012.html">Trensmat website</a> where you can also listen to short samples of a couple of tracks including Britta's mix.</p>
