<p>More details about the vinyl release of Dean & Britta's first album L'Avventura have been published via the Dean & Britta news mailing list...</p>
<blockquote><p>As previously mentioned, L'Avventura will finally be available on vinyl in September. We decided not to sacrifice audio quality by squeezing the bonus tracks onto the vinyl, but each vinyl copy will come with a free copy of the re-issued compact disc inside (which includes the three bonus tracks).</p></blockquote>
