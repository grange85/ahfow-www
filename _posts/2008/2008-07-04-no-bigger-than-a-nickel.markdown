<p>I'm a bit disappointed that there's <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=%22empire%20state%20building%22%20nickel&w=all&s=int">no photographic proof on Flickr</a> that the Empire State Building is in fact no bigger than a nickel.</p>
<p>Does  anyone in the vicinity fancy taking their camera and a coin out and snapping a picture that proves it - 'cos...you know that cameras never lie...</p>
<p>Eternal gratitude to anyone who can do this for me...</p>
