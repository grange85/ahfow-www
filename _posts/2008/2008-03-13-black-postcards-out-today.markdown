<blockquote><p>Black Postcards is a riveting, chilling read: a cautionary tale for anyone thinking of starting an old-school indie rock band, shot through with regret, desire and longing.<br />

<blockquote><p>At times a truly depressing read, and a more than valid shattering of the myth that living the dream does not automatically make for an easy bed, especially when those moments of being onstage for 90 minutes barely add up to the days and weeks in limbo where you try to exist as best you know how.<br />
