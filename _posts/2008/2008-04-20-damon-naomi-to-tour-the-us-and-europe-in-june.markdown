<p><a href="http://www.damonandnaomi.com/">Damon & Naomi</a> have <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.damonandnaomi.com/tourdates/tourdates1.html"> announced dates in the US and Europe for this summer</span>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Come warmer weather, we'll be hitting the road again. First a US tour together with the new duo of <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.dragcity.com/bands/helenabatoh.html">Helena Espvall (Espers) & Masaki Batoh (Ghost)</span>, as they promote their debut on Drag City and we all wend our way to Terrastock. Then it's off to Europe for our first ever shows in Ireland (and Northern Ireland), plus a stop in London (venue tba, but we're pretty sure it's happening) as we make our way to a festival appearance in Toulouse, France. A post-Toulouse show in nearby Bordeaux seems to be shaping up. And if there's no post-Bordeaux show in Paris, well, we'll just busk outside the Deux Magots like everyone else.</p>
<p>Note: all these upcoming shows will be as a straight-ahead duo, though plans are afoot to play at least a couple songs with Batoh and Helena on our tour together.</p>
