<p>I've just launched the 14th A Head Full of Wishes survey, so it's time to start figuring out your favourite albums and tracks and then head on over to the <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/surveyform/">survey form</span> and make your selections. You can choose one album and five tracks for each artist (Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon & Naomi and Dean & Britta).</p>
<p>I'll probably let it run for three or four weeks (or when the form-filling dries up) so expect results shortly before xmas.</p>
<p>If you need some inspiration feel free to peruse <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/survey/2007/">last year's Survey results</a> and previous surveys back until 1995!</p>
<p>PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD as last years turnout was the lowest for many years...</p>
