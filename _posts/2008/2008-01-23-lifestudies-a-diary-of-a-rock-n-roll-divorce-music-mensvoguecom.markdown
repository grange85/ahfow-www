<p>An Excerpt from Dean Wareham's book is on the Men's Vogue website. <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.mensvogue.com/arts/music/articles/2008/02/facingthemusic">A diary of a rock 'n' roll divorce</span> covers the period when Britta joined Luna and Dean's subsequent divorce from his wife Claudia. There's a few nice but small photos to accompany it (one of which I've ripped off here!)...</p>
<blockquote><p>After all the auditions, my bandmates and I stood outside on Avenue A to pick our new bassist. Our drummer, Lee, was sure that we should hire Britta. I was leaning that way. Sean, who played guitar, was on the fence. This was as close to a unanimous decision as we were going to get. It would be the first time a girl was part of our lineup.</p>
<p>"Listen," I said. "No hanky-panky. If anyone gets involved with her, they're out of the band."</p></blockquote>
