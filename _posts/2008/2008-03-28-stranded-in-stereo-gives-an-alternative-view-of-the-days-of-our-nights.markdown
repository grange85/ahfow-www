<p><a href="http://strandedinstereo.blogspot.com/2008/03/my-formative-years-days-of-our-nights.html">Stranded In Stereo</a> has a cool post about The Days of Our Nights", the album that Dean described (in Black Postcards)  as "possibly the worst" of Luna's albums ("It's not for lack of trying that the fifth album is a bloated dud"). It has inspired me to give the album another listen...</p>
<blockquote><p>"Is that your favorite album?" he asked me with great enthusiasm, amidst the hints of a New Zealand accent that still penetrated his speak from time to time. I had quickly said no, and that it was just my introduction to Luna for fear that an idol of mine was going to tear me a new one for citing that bloated dud of an album as the highpoint of their career. As he handed my book back to me, he let me in on a little secret.</p>
<p>"My favorite album changes all the time," he said. "I used to hate Lunapark, but I listened to it the other day and now it's my favorite."</p>
<p>I guess I should've just been up front with him.</p></blockquote>
