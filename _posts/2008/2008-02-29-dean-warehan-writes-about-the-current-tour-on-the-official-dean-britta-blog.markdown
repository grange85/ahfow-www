<p>Dean has posted another lengthy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080229+/http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=110">post on the official Dean & Britta blog</a> - they may be sporadic but they're big and packed with sex, drugs and rock and roll when they do arrive...</p>
<blockquote><p>Cold as it was that day, it was hot on stage at the Cedar Cultural Centre, and I had to remove my sweater during the show, revealing the T-shirt that I wore in my bunk the previous evening: BOSTON SUCKS. Of course a photo of me in that shirt quickly appeared on the internet. That’s the way it is now. Someone is always videotaping or photographing you on stage, as Michael Richards learned.</p>
<p>Our friends at Zoe/Rounder are based just outside Boston, and I did receive a query from our product manager on the offending shirt.</p>
<p>“DEAN!?”</p>
<p>“It’s not the people, or the city of Boston that suck,” I explained. “The shirt refers only to your baseball team.”</p></blockquote>
