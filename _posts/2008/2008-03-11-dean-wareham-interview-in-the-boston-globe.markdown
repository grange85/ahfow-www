<p>The Boston Globe has an interview/article about Black Postcards which covers the break up of Galaxie 500 and specifically comparing the two sides of the story. The article, <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/03/08/making_and_losing_the_band/?page=2">Making (and losing) the band</a>, also has quotes from Kramer and a "no comment" comment from Damon & Naomi. </p>
<blockquote><p>Wareham made the provocative choice to open his memoir with a comment from Krukowski, taken from a 1997 interview in which he accuses the band's frontman of duplicity and egomania: "Naomi and I had developed a strong distrust of Dean, which in the end turned out to be not nearly strong enough - we were blind-sided, despite our misgivings about the person he was becoming," the passage begins. Wareham goes on to spill plenty of ink recounting his version of events. He is clear-eyed and occasionally harsh about everyone involved, himself included</p>
<p>"I wasn't intending to settle scores with the book but I couldn't help myself," says Wareham, a New Zealand native who moved to New York as a teen. "Somebody directed me to that interview, which is posted on Damon & Naomi's website. We can't be happy with everything everyone says, and if it wasn't out there being displayed, if people didn't still ask me about it, I wouldn't have used it in the book. But it was a pretty scathing attack on me."</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean Wareham's memoir <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594201552?tag=aheadfullofwi-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=1594201552&adid=18P2XSZHT42QCEZ9RQPG&">Black Postcards</a> is released on Wednesday</p>
