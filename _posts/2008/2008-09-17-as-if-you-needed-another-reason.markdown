<p>The excellent blog <a href="http://www.thesoundofindie.com">The Sound of Indie</a> recenly posted a lovely sounding track from Dean & Britta's "Galaxie 500 show" from a few weeks back (<a href="/2008/09/12/mp3-of-dean-britta-covering-galaxie-500-covering-red-krayola/">see previous post</a>), I was among a number of people who pleaded for an opportunity to hear the whole show. Sadly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Wolfson">Howard Wolfson</a> a pundit for the vile "media" outlet Fox News apparantly also contacted the blog asking for more. <a href="http://www.thesoundofindie.com/?p=700">The Sound of Indie responded</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>I appreciate your interest in the Dean & Britta show and congrats on your new blog. I am in a bit of a quandary since it seems you are associated with Fox News. I, for one take to heart the simple axiom: “You are only as good as the company you keep”, which in the case of Fox News, as a company, doesn’t get any worse. Regardless your politically leanings or good intentions, you are simply another tool for the colossal super-conducting super-colliding horseshit/noise-generating machine that is Fox News.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>So concerning the Dean & Britta show: If Obama wins this election, you and all TSOI readers will get a copy of the truly sublime recording. If, however, the unconscionable happens - that those other two are elected - no one will hear that full recording and Fox News will largely be to blame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saddened as I am not to be getting my paws on this recording (yet) I have to admire the stand taken by The Sound of Indie and point out that there are lots of reasons to vote Obama/Biden, and lots, LOTS more NOT TO VOTE FOR McCain/Palin...but just in case you needed another one...</p>
<p>In the meantime The Sound of Indie has posted another track from the show to whet your appetite...</p>
