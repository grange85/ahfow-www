<p>Dean has posted an article on <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=15">the Dean & Britta blog</a> (the real one not the MySpace one although I guess it'll go there as well) summarising the first part of their European tour...</p>
<blockquote><p>We set out for Newark airport on Thanksgiving day, 2007, flying SAS to Copenhagen, the first stop on our tour of Northern Europe. We were four – Britta and myself, our drummer Anthony LaMarca, and keyboard player Ben Freeman. There would be no crew traveling with us, so in addition to being the singer I was tour manager and would do the bulk of the driving. Ben was the designated navigator. But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>and he managed to squeeze in a plug for the book as well...</p>
<blockquote><p>It was dark when we arrived in Copenhagen, and we were happy to find a van to take us to our humble hotel, the Hotel Saga, located behind Copenhagen’s main train station. I am familiar with this area, I had wandered around these streets in 1991 after the one and only Galaxie 500 show in this city. But that’s another story, one told more fully in my book.</p></blockquote>
