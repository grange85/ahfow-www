<div class="imagebox-center"><br/><span class="removed_link" title="http://forum.fullofwishes.co.uk">Oblivious - A new online forum</span></div>
<p>It's been a few years since I last tried to get an online forum going for A Head Full of Wishes and I thought it was time to try again. The <a href="/mailing-list/">Galaxie 500 Mailing List</a> has been a bit quiet of late, maybe that's because things are just quiet or maybe it's because mailing lists are so 20th century and people would much prefer to do things in their web browser - I suppose this is where we find out.</p>
<p>For starters I've created three forums one for "on topic", one for "off topic" and one for "tech stuff" - I was tempted to go with just one forum for everything as it seemed a bit silly to spread what may be a rather quiet enterprise thinner than necessary but I am aware that there have been list users in the past who find the off-topic posting a bit frustrating so we'll go with this and see how things pan out.</p>
<p>This is an out of the box installation of phpBB and as such it is packed with "features" that probably need turning off or tweaking, if you do find anything that bothers you or that could be better please post it in the "tech stuff" forum.</p>
<p>Please come and join us at <span class="removed_link" title="http://forum.fullofwishes.co.uk">Oblivious - The new online forum for A Head Full of Wishes</span></p>
