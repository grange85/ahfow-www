<p>I can't help but thinking this is asking for your money a bit too early but anyway you can pre-order the American Laudromat Records Cure tribute CD from their website - the CD isn't officially released until January 27th - but if you pre-order it you can get it in time for xmas! The CD features Dean & Britta covering Friday I'm in Love that they recorded with Nick Kramer <a href="/2008/04/15/dean-britta-recording-a-tribute-to-the-cure/">back in April</a>. The album also features a track by Elk City.</p>
<p>And talking of Elk City, while at the American Laundromat web site I noticded that they're also selling (exclusively through iTunes so I won't be buying it!) an Elk City cover of REMs Everybody Hurts  with Sean on guitar.</p>
