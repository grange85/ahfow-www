<p>Dean will talking with host David Dye about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594201552?tag=aheadfullofwi-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=1594201552&adid=1E9GRED7ADRBBJ2TMKWV&">Black Postcards</a> in the second hour of the 8 May edition of NPR's World Cafe. You can find out when it will be broadcast by your local public radio station on the NPR website or you can listen to the WXPN stream at 2pm Eastern Standard Time (<a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=5&day=8&year=2008&hour=14&min=0&sec=0&p1=179">what time is that where I live?</a>). Hopefully it'll be archived and/or podcast as well.</p>
