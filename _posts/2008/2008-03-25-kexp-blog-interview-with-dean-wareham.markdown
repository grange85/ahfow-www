<p>There's a short interview with Dean Wareham on <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/kexp/blog/?p=5323">KEXP Blog</a> talking about Black Postcards and Tell Me Do You Miss Me...</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Is it much different reading the book reviews than it is reading what people have to say about your music?</strong><br />
Well, the book is more personal, so I guess I do take the reviews for it more personally as well . It’s not just an album; it’s my life. Everyone seems to have an idea how the book could be different. Some people say there’s too much detail about Galaxie 500, or there’s not enough about this or that area.</p></blockquote>
