<p>Japanese label <a href="http://www.videoartsmusic.com/">Video Arts Music</a> have just re-issued the three Galaxie 500 studio albums as well as the Copenhagen live album on CD in lovely looking cardboard LP-style sleeves. Damon & Naomi are selling the four releases for the price of three (although being Japanese imports this is still quite pricey - $75 for all four albums) so if you fancy these gorgeous looking releases head on over to the merch page on damon&naomi.com.</p>
