<p>Pre orders of the <a href="http://www.alr-music.com/">American Laundromat Records</a> album Just Like Heaven - A Tribute to The Cure have started shipping (I got mine on Friday). American Laundromat have put up a media web page where you can stream some tracks (including Dean & Britta's cover of Friday I'm in Love), read quotes from the contributors and download high-res images of the acts.</p>
<blockquote><p>I suggested we cover Friday I'm In Love, because it was one of the songs on the first mix CD Dean gave me back in 2000. The outro of our version is my favorite part because somehow it ended up sounding like ABBA. -- Britta Phillips</p></blockquote>
