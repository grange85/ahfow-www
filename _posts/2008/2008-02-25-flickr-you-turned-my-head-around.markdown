<p>That moment in "You Turned Your Head Around" when Britta leans back and belts out the "b-a-a-a-a-b-y" line is clearly like crack to photographers. It seems there's no way to resist taking a photo of that moment. So in honour of that and because I'd like to see a slideshow of all those pictures I've created a group on (photo sharing site) Flickr dedicated to photographs of that moment in that song.</p>
