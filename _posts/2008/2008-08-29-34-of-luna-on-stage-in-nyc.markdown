<p>Three quarters of Luna shared the stage of the Bowery Ballroom to perform 23 Minutes in Brussels last Tuesday at the recent benefit show for <a href="http://www.frankbango.com">Frank Bango</a>. Dean & Britta were on the bill and Sean Eden was playing guitar wit Mr Bango as well as with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/simonewhite">Simone White</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/victoriawilliams">Victoria Williams</a>. Sean then joined Dean & Britta in an (almost) impromptu performance of the Luna classic. Sean emailed me to let me know (and was surprised that I hadn't heard!)...</p>
<blockquote><p>It was definitely a slightly emotional and strange moment for me and for Dean & Britta....! We hadn't decided we were going to play anything until late that afternoon. no rehearsal or soundcheck for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2008/08/frank_bango_ben.html">bunch of pictures from the whole show at Brooklyn Vegan</a> - none of the three of them together but plenty of Dean & Britta and you can see Sean backing Simone White.</p>
