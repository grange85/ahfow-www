<p>Lovely Spanish indie outfit <a href="http://www.polartheband.com/">Polar</a> are celebrating their 10th anniversary with the release of a covers album that features versions of Galaxie 500's "Tell Me" and "King of Spain" and Damon & Naomi's "Information Age". The album also features covers of songs by Yo La Tengo, Bedhead and The Velvet Underground. The album will be released in May on Jabalina records and will also include a DVD documentary about the band. You can hear a couple of tracks from the album (including Tell Me) on the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/polartheband">band's MySpace page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Next May will see the release of Polarâ€™s new album, their most excitimg so far, which will include an extra DVD featuring a documentary about the band in their 10th anniversary, at the price of a single CD. Before they start writing new material for their fifth album, due out in 2009, they have decided to look back on their influences by compiling the different versions they have recorded in the past (most of them unavailable at the moment) and recording five new covers.</p></blockquote>
