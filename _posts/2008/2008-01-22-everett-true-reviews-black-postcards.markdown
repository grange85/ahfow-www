<p>Everett True has a <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2008/01/hugs_dean_wareham_laurie_lindeen.php">short review of Black Postcards on his Village Voice blogs</a></p>
<blockquote><p>He is pretty fucking harsh on himself, full stop. Often, you’re like, “Dean! Quit it! If you don’t like the way you’re behaving, don’t behave like it! You’re a sensitive, intelligent person—get over it.” Yet, despite—or perhaps because of—all that, Black Postcards is a riveting, chilling read: a cautionary tale for anyone thinking of starting an old-school indie rock band, shot through with regret, desire and longing. There. That’s my pull quote for the dust jacket. Can I go now?</p></blockquote>
