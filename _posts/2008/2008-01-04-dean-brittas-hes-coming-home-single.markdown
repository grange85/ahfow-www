<p>I got my copy (copies!) of Dean & Britta's Christmas single a couple of days after Christmas but that didn't stop it getting plenty of spins over the next few days (I'd resisted listening to it on MySpace because waiting a couple of days rather than visiting MySpace is always preferable). </p>
<p>The package <em>is</em> lovely and the track an absolute gem and sure to become a seasonal regular. If you haven't bought it yet you really ought to - <a href="http://www.myspace.com/deanandbritta">check it out on MySpace</a> and then head off to <a href="http://www.chimneyrocks.org/hescominghome.html">Chimney Rocks</a> and hope they have a copy or two left - then pack it away with the decorations for an end of year treat (or listen to it all year round!).</p>
