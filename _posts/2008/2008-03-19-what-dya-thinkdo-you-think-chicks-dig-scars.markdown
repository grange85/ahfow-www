<p>This is a trailer for the short film, <a href="http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=30088876">Pumpkin Hell</a>, that Dean mentioned in an interview a while back but that I'd forgotten about since then - the trailer is pretty funny and Dean looks the part as a sleazy pumpkin seller...so I hope the whole film gets onto the Internet soon...<br />

If you're in the Orlando area it is showing as part of the Florida Film Festival on 30 March and the 3 April. You should probably take the opportunity while you can as it'll probably go the way of Piggie and <a href="/2006/05/22/lola-a-short-film-featuring-dean-wareham/">Lola</a>...</p>
