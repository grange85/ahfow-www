<p>After <a href="/about/#comment-570">a few  requests</a> I've finally got off my arse and started putting back a few of the things that were lost in the last upgrade. The lists of <a href="/database/track/list/">tracks</a>, <a href="/database/track/list/guitar">guitar chords/tab</a> and <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/track/list/covers/">cover versions</span> are the first to put in a reappearance. There will be more - feel free to comment if there's anything else missing or that you'd like to see...</p>
