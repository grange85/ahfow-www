<p>There's a bit of a followup to <a href="/2008/04/05/black-postcards-a-rock-roll-romance-dean-wareham-book-review-new-york-times/">Liz Phair's NY Times review of Black Postcards</a> in an <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/20696130/liz_phair_fifteen_years_in_guyville">interview on Rolling Stone's website</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>You recently reviewed former Luna and Galaxie 500 frontman Dean Wareham's autobiography for The New York Times. How did that come about?</strong><br />
I had a really good time writing that. They approached me, and I have no idea how I got the gig. But I wasn't going to pass it up. I think because I mention Galaxie 500 in [Exile in Guyville's] "Stratford-on-Guy."</p></blockquote>
