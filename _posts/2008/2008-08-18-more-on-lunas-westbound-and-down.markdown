<p>Sean Eden emailed to fill me in on the details of the Luna track <a href="/2008/08/15/a-new-to-me-at-least-luna-track/">Westbound and Down that I came across earlier in the week</a> - here's what he had to say...</p>
<blockquote><p>[It] was something i agreed to do for a friend in Austin Texas, who came to Luna shows and threw some good parties. His brother had made a low-budget movie called "Radio Free Steve", and they wanted a cover of this song with lyrics slightly changed for the last scene of the film. I was given $800 for the recording cost and Lee, Dean and I did it in an afternoon for about $400. The other $400 remaining was used to fund the video for "Superfreaky Memories" done by my friend Christian Moore. I play the bass and all guitars on the tune, Lee's on drums, and of course Dean is singing.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other Sean news he has recently recorded with Dave Derby's new project <a href="http://www.myspace.com/gramercyarms ">Gramercy Arms</a> - the album is getting lots of good reviews (in the UK for some reason) and...</p>
<blockquote><p>...is a collective of New York-based artists comprising former members of Guided By Voices, Luna, Joan as Police Woman, The Dambuilders,</p></blockquote>
