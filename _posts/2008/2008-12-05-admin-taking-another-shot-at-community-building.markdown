<p>The latest in the long line of trying to turn A Head Full of Wishes into something a bit more than a news and information website is now being trialled. The site now has some "social" functionality provided by <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.google.com/friendconnect/">Google's Friend Connect</span> which means you can sign in to the site (using your Google account if you have one) and once signed in you'll be able to write comments on the "wall", rate and review albums in the database, feel connected with other users of the site and...well actually that's about it for now but there will be more to follow.</p>
<p>The review and rating will be extended to shows so you can write short "I was there" posts about and let other users know just what they missed.</p>
<p>I'll be adding new features during the trial and any suggestions would be very much appreciated, either leave a comment or <a href="mailto:andy@grange85.co.uk">email me</a>.</p>
