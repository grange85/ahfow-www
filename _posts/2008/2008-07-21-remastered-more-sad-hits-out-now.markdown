<p>The newly remastered version of Damon & Naomi's first album More Sad Hits (from 1992) is now available to buy on CD from the usual outlets or direct from <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.damonandnaomi.com/frameset/main.html">DamonandNaomi.com</span>. The LP version, which has been delayed and will be released in September, is available to pre-order.</p>
<blockquote><p>The good news is that the CD package turned out beautifully. It's made to look like a mini-gatefold LP, on heavy shiny card stock, and there's really no better way to describe it than, "cute."</p></blockquote>
