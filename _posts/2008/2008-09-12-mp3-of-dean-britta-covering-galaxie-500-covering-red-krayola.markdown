<p><a href="http://www.thesoundofindie.com/?p=672">The Sound of Indie</a> has posted an mp3 from Dean & Britta's Galaxie 500 set at the Zipper Factpry a couple of weeks back.</p>
<blockquote><p>This show featured ten (!!!) Galaxy 500 tunes. Needless to say, the show was sublime. Imagine sitting is a small theater listening to [the] set performed perfectly [...] It was good enough to make a grown man cry. I am sure many did.</p></blockquote>
