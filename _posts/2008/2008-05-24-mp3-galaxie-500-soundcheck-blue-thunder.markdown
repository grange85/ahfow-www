<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a> introduced the wonderful concept of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boing_Boing#Unicorn_chaser">Unicorn Chaser</a> whereby a particularly unpleasant post would be followed by something considerably sweeter to look at - and what could be sweeter than a unicorn? So here's my equivalent. This is Galaxie 500 performing Blue Thunder at a soundcheck for a show in Holland in 1989...I'd say that's a sweet follow-on to the long, dry yawn of the previous post.</p>
<p>MP3: <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/5ev8o4gsgw">Galaxie 500- Blue Thunder (soundcheck) @  15 November 1989: Burgerweehuis, Deventer, Netherlands</a> (at box.net)</p>
