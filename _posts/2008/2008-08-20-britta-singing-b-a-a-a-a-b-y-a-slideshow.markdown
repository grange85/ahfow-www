<p>I set up the Flickr group called "You Turned My Head Around" to catch all the (many) photos of Britta singing the "b-a-a-a-a-b-y" line from that song just so I could see a slideshow of them. Flickr have updated their code so that the slideshow can now be embedded on other sites. The only reason for this post is so I can share my obsession...</p>

<p>Any flickr users with similar pictures that I haven't already solicited into the group please come, join the group, and add to the pool - and remember when Dean & Britta are in town to snap those b-a-a-a-a-by pictures for me!</p>
