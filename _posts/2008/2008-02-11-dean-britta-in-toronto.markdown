<p>I always look forward to my favourite bands reaching Toronto because there seem to be some very talented writers and photographers who seem happy to write and photograph them...here's a couple of reviews of Dean & Britta's Mod Club show at the weekend...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Frank from the always great Chromewaves has <a href="http://www.chromewaves.net/index.php?itemid=2918">written a great review</a> and <a href="http://www.chromewaves.net/concertPhotos.php?concert=deanAndBritta2">taken a stack of superb pictures</a>.</p>
<p>As has quadb over at at <a href="http://itsnotthebandihateitstheirfans.blogspot.com/2008/02/dean-britta-wkeren-ann-mod-club.html">It's Not The Band I Hate, It's Their Fans</a> - read the <a href="http://itsnotthebandihateitstheirfans.blogspot.com/2008/02/dean-britta-wkeren-ann-mod-club.html">review</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/quadb/sets/72157603882750563/">see the pictures on Flickr</a></p>
