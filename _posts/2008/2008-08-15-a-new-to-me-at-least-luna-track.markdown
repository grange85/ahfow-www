<p>OK, so it's probably a bit arrogant but I really had an idea that this site (and therefore I) pretty much knew all there was to know about Luna and their published work (or at least from 1994/5 onwards) so when I came across a track I knew nothing about this morning I felt a bizarre mix of excitement and shame. </p>
<p>One of my Google alerts threw up this <a href="http://candybarzine.blogspot.com/2008/08/luna-tell-me-do-you-miss-me-dvd.html">cool post on Candybar</a> about Tell Me Do You Miss Me - at the bottom of which the poster, Frank, had linked to a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080823133756/http://www.mixwit.com:80/fprovost5/luna-a-starting-point">mixwit introduction to Luna</a> mix. I idly clicked the button and started listening and went on with my other business. Then on came "Westbound and Down" - it was definitely Dean singing but I had never heard, or heard of, this track.</p>
<p>A bit of poking around the Internet revealed that the track was recorded for the film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274748/">Radio Free Steve</a> (official site), the film had been (mostly) made in 1984 and released in 2000 (<a href="http://radiofreesteve.com/buydvd.html">available on DVD from here</a>). Westbound and Down is a cover of a Jerry Reed track from the "comedy" film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076729/">Smokey & the Bandit</a> (you can hear the original over here - youtube). The lyrics for Luna's version have been changed to suit its new use.</p>

<p>Sean explained in an email to me about how Westbound and Down came about<br />
<blockquote>[It] was something i agreed to do for a friend in Austin Texas, who came to Luna shows and threw some good parties. His brother had made a low-budget movie called "Radio Free Steve", and they wanted a cover of this song with lyrics slightly changed for the last scene of the film. I was given $800 for the recording cost and Lee, Dean and I did it in an afternoon for about $400. The other $400 remaining was used to fund the video for "Superfreaky Memories" done by my friend Christian Moore. I play the bass and all guitars on the tune, Lee's on drums, and of course Dean is singing.</p></blockquote>
