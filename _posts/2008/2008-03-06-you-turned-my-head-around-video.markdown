<p>As mentioned in my previous post the new video for Dean & Britta's You Turned My Head Around hit the web yesterday - it's now <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaPFJGN28bA">turned up on YouTube</a> which means you can watch it without leaving the comfort of A Head Full of Wishes. The video is a sweet gem and features Britta cycling (on a very cool looking bike) around singing and looking gorgeous, and Dean on foot (in some very nice shoes) walking around and looking gorgeous.</p>

<p>My obsessive nature requires me however to be bothered by what the song is called, is it...</p>
<p>"You Turned My Head Around" (which is what's written on the CD, which is what I always thought was being sung, what I <a href="/database/track/317/">put in my database</a>, what <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.somevelvetmorning.net/">this Lee Hazlewood website</span> calls it and what I think Britta sings in the second and third choruses.</p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>"You Turn My Head Around" (which is pretty much everywhere else, including in this video, on the Dean & Britta website, Amazon  and Musicbrainz (for both the Ann-Margaret and Dean & Britta versions), on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/grange85/572241135/">Dean's hand-written setlists</a> and what Britta seems to sing in the first chorus.</p>
<p>Maybe we should have a vote...</p>
<p><ins datetime="2008-03-10T20:59:18+00:00">OK - Dean got in touch with me and here's the position...<br />
<strong>Turned:</strong>
<ul>
<li>original (Lee Hazlewood/Ann-Margaret) 7" single</li>
<li>rights society (<span class="removed_link" title="http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=550063573&search_in=i&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=10&start=1">ASCAP</span>)</li>
<li>(and because of that) on the sleeve of Back Numbers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Turn:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Cowboy & The Lady (CD release)</li>
<li>the video</li>
</ul>
<p>Which I'm going to take as a fairly resounding victory for "Turned" and I'm off to fix Musicbrainz!<br />
