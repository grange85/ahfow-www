<p>Britta has <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=194">written a post on the deanandbritta.com blog</a> about the bands recent tour supporting Mercury Rev.</p>
<blockquote><p>After 20 or 30 minutes, we came back to a much fuller room and finished our set, but my mic died again before our last song, Bonnie and Clyde, so I had to share Deanâ€™s mic. It [was] hard for us not to laugh because we had to almost kiss every time we sang the chorus together</p></blockquote>
