<p>Next Friday sees the premiere of 13 Most Beautiful...Songs for Andy Warhol's Screen Tests as part of the Pittsburgh International Festival of Firsts. The show features 13 of <a href="http://www.warholstars.org/filmch/screen.html">Andy Warhol's famous "screen tests"</a> (chosen from the 200 in the Warhol Museum's archive) including those of  Lou Reed, Edie Sedgewick, Nico and Dennis Hopper and will feature Dean & Britta performing a live accompaniment</p>
<p>There's an <a href="http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A53755">interview with Dean & Britta about the show in the Pittsburgh City Paper</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>And so what Dean & Britta will provide are 13 songs, of four minutes each. Most are new compositions, with a few covers thrown in -- a Bob Dylan song and a lesser-known Velvet Underground tune for the Lou Reed film -- and at least one reworking of a Luna tune. While there are no immediate plans to make an album of just these songs, they say they're sure to re-use at least some of the songs in future releases.</p></blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/14/AR2008101402916.html">a brief mention in a piece about the festival in the Washington Post</a>...</p>
<p>The show gets performed twice at the festival on Friday and Saturday at The Byham Theatre, tickets are available at the festival's web site.</p>
<p>Next year the show will visit other venues across the US over the next few months and hopefully will get a DVD release in February.</p>

<p>Update: There's an <a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribunereview/search/s_593792.html">interview with Dean in the current Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>"I got a call from Ben Harrison, the music curator at the Warhol," explains Wareham. "I've worked with them before -- they were always nice to Luna. Ordinarily, they loan 'Screen Tests' to galleries or universities, but not a lot of people have seen them. If you look on YouTube, there's nothing, which is incredible. So many of these are of famous people -- Bob Dylan, Salvador Dali, Edie Sedgwick."</p></blockquote>
