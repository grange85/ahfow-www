<p>All of this is merely a scarcely re-versioned news report that was recently posted on Damon & Naomi's web site so you may want to head over there to read it...</p>
<p>Damon & Naomi's very excellent debut album More Sad Hits is being reissued on their own <a href="http://www.20-20-20.com/">20|20|20</a> label - remastered onto CD and LP and "the best this record ever sounded" it will hopefully be available to buy on their upcoming tour with Masaki Batoh & Helena Espvall. Also available on the tour will be a(nother) lovely <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140517101809/http://ikerspozio.net/">Iker Spozio</a> limited edition poster and a cool looking <a href="http://www.garygrahamnyc.com/">Gary Graham</a> designed T-shirt (Gary Graham previously designed Naomi's wardrobe for their Boris tour).</p>
<p>Damon's book of prose poetry "The Memory Theater Burned" is getting published in French under the title "Lisez-moi," by Editions de l'Attente in Bordeaux.</p>
<p>The Damon & Naomi track Stars Never Fade was recently used in an episode of CBS legal drama <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_(TV_series)">Shark</a> - you might be able to watch it over at the CBS website...I couldn't...</p>
<p>And finally French photographer <a href="http://www.coriolislab.org/">Cedrick Eymenier</a> has made this rather lovely video for the track Within These Walls...</p>
