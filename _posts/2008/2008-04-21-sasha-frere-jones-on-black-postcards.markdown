<p>The New Yorker's music critic <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sashafrerejones/2008/04/crazy.html">Sasha Frere-Jones reviews both Black Postcards</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/books/review/Phair-t.html?ex=1207972800&en=4a3556391635b4fd&ei=5070">Liz Phair's NY Times review of Black Postcards</a> in a post on the New Yorker Online...</p>
<blockquote><p>Wareham’s book briefly recounts his childhood—there is an excellent line about a hat he wore as a schoolboy in New Zealand—and moves on to his beginnings as a musician, and his time in Galaxie 500. Wareham is dry, and, after a hundred pages, I wanted a long, tall glass of enthusiasm. The deadpan routine works for some aspects of the rock life, though.</p></blockquote>
