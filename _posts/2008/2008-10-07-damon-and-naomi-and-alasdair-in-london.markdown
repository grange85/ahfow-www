<p><a href="http://www.damonandnaomi.com/">Damon & Naomi</a>'s show this Sunday at London's Rough Trade East will be as a trio after Damon trimmed the top of his finger off while cutting an apple. The show will go ahead with <a href="http://theclientele.blogspot.com/">Alasdair MacLean</a> of <a href="http://www.theclientele.co.uk/">The Clientele</a> doing the bits that Damon's finger prevents him from doing. </p>
<blockquote><p>How will Damon pull off this Django Reinhardt-like trick? We're all wondering. But coming to the rescue, fretwise, will be Alasdair MacLean of The Clientele -- he has graciously agreed to fill in for any missing fingers. Maybe the nasty accident will turn into something to celebrate?</p></blockquote>
<p>The show will also provide the opportunity to buy a limited CDR of Damon & Naomi covering Irving Berlin's White Christmas which they recorded for the film Lovely, Still. Each CDR will come in a hand-drawn sleeve.</p>
<p>The show is free and starts at 7pm - collect wristbands from the shop one hour before showtime.</p>
