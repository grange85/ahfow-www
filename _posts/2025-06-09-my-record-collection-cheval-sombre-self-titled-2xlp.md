This is the 10th anniversary double LP version of Cheval Sombre's beautiful debut album that was originally released on CD on Dean and Britta's Double Feature Records.

This was released by Fat Elvis Records in 2020 and I haven't been able to figure out how I got it - apparently this edition was limited to 300 copies and sold through Norman Records in the UK, or direct from Fat Elvis - I'd assumed I'd have bought it from Norman, but it's not in my order history - it seems unlikely I'd have bought it anywhere else? Did I buy it from Sean at Fat Elvis, or did he send it to me?? It's odd for something just five years old that I can't find any evidence of it in my email. Inside the sleeve are a couple of Fat Elvis stickers... is that a clue?

_Update: Sean/Fat Elvis got in touch and cleared things up it seems I bought this direct from him with the arrangement happening on Facebook (where I never thought to look)._

Either way Sean at Fat Elvis Records has produced a lovely package deserving of the lovely music it contains (although a double album should always be in a gatefold sleeve).

I was additionally confused by the fact that my green-ish copy didn't seem to be the same as the one described on Discogs as "natural with blue, red, and yellow wisps" but the review on _It's Psychedelic Baby_ seems to explain that:

<blockquote>
Due to vinyl manufacturing and the colors involved in the pressing, not all the records pressed look identical to the ones pictured. Some of the records appear milky white with blue, yellow, and red swirls while others have a green-ish tint with blue, yellow, and red swirls.

My greenish copy is very nice, and certainly much nicer than the [label blowout copies](https://www.discogs.com/release/14787634-Cheval-Sombre-Cheval-Sombre/image/SW1hZ2U6NDQ0Nzk0OTQ=).

The music is of course beautiful and the LP was exapnded with some original demo versions.

Dean Wareham plays guitar on three tracks {% ahfowtrack "I Found it Not So" %}, The World is Wrong, and I've Been Around This World. Britta isn't credited with specific tracks so I guess can be found adding "bass, microkorg and celesta" over the album - she also mixed I Found it Not So, and has an _additional engineering_ credit.
