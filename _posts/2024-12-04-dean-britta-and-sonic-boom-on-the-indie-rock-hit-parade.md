Dean and Britta and Sonic Boom were [guests on WXPN's Indie Rock Hit Parade earlier](https://xpn.org/2024/12/03/irhp-dean-and-britta-and-sonic-boom-interview/) talking about A Peace of Us, and their favourite (and least favourite) aspects of the holiday season.

<blockquote>
As a fan not only of this trio’s music but holiday music in general, I could not have been more excited to chat with Wareham, Phillips, and Kember about A Peace of Us. In our conversation you’ll hear how Phillips’ attitude towards Christmas music has changed over the years, why Wareham decided to include a cover of “Snow is Falling in Manhattan” as a tribute to his late friend David Berman, and the surprising album that Kember forever associates with holiday time.
