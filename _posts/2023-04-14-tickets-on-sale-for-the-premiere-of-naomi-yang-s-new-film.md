The film will be screened at The Brattle Theater in Cambridge, MA at 19:45 and [tickets are available now for $15](https://iffboston.org/series/the-festival/screening/never-be-a-punching-bag-for-nobody)

> The film weaves together three stories: colorful boxing coach and ex-drill sergeant Sal Bartolo Jr., son of a renowned 1940s East Boston boxing champ; Yang herself, learning boxing from trainer Bartolo and reexamining some of her own familyâ€™s disturbing history; and schoolteacher Mary Ellen Welch, who in the 1960s mobilized a group of neighborhood women against encroachment from Logan airport, fighting back against an indifferent city government. None of these protagonists are destined to win the Big Fight, but all offer inspiration to anyone determined to stand up for themselves and hold their ground.
