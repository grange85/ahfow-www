A new version of Galaxie 500's "Uncollected" is to be getting a deluxe 2xLP release in September. The album contains a number of tracks not previously officially released and is now available to pre-order in a number of formats from [Galaxie 500's Bandcamp](https://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/album/uncollected-noise-new-york-88-90) or from record shops.

The album contains the first official release of the recordings the band made at Noise New York between 1988 and 1990, most of which have been doing the rounds in [poor quality bootlegs](/2023/08/17/my-record-collection-061-galaxie-500-unreleased-sessions-and-live-at-the-rat/) for many years but are now finally getting a proper release!

### February 1988 session

 - Shout You Down _first official release. This track is [available to listen to on Bandcamp](https://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/track/shout-you-down).

### February 1989 session

 - I Wanna Live _first official release, a live version turned up from a show in December 1988_

 ... in 2012 I asked Dean about it:

 <blockquote>
      <p>AHFoW: Hi Dean, whatever happened to I Wanna Live? Was it a cover? I keep coming across it and meaning to ask...</p>
      <p>Dean: it was an original. . . a song we tried out live (apparently) but never recorded in the studio. So I guess you could say that nothing happened to it.</p>
 </blockquote>

_so I guess he'd forgotten that there was a studio recording of it. This track is [available to listen to on Bandcamp](https://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/track/i-wanna-live)_
