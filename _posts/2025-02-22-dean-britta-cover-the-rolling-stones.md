While listening to [Dean and Britta's guest slot](/articles/dean-and-britta-on-pure-wkpn/) on Howard Thompson's radio show yesterday they snuck in a cover of The Rolling Stones' _The Singer Not the Song_ that they'd recorded and that I was unaware of.

{% ahfowimage "https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3123431363_65" "Super Bloom: A Benefit for Fire Relief in Los Angeles " %}

The song was recorded for [Super Bloom](https://superbloomabenefitforfirereliefinlosangeles.bandcamp.com/album/super-bloom-a-benefit-for-fire-relief-in-los-angeles) which is a lengthy benefit release for fire relief following the Los Angeles fires earlier in the year.

For $10 (or more) you get Dean & Britta covering The Stones and a hatful of other great songs ~ well worth throwing some money at.
