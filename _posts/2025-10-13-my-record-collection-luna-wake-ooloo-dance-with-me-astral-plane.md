This split single was released as being a tribute to Jonathan Richman and had Luna doing a cover of Dance With Me on one side and post-Feelies band Wake Ooloo covering Astral Plane on the flip.

Dance With Me was originally recorded by The Modern Lovers in the 1972 sessions with producer Kim Fowley but not released until the Original Modern Lovers LP was released in 1981. Luna's version was recorded during the sessions for Penthouse and was first released on the [Beggars Banquet 7" single of Bobby Peru](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2023/11/16/my-record-collection-087-luna-bobby-peru-7/) in 1997 before being included on this split single.

Wake Ooloo were the band formed by Glenn Mercer and Dave Weckerman when The Feelies split after _Time For a Witness_ in the mid 90s, they released three albums of Feelies-a-like angular rock before splitting. This single was released on _ROCKER! Supernova Records_ in 1998 by which time Wake Ooloo had, or were just about to, come to the end of their life.

This [two part interview with Glenn and Dave](https://www.furious.com/perfect/ooloo.html) ([part 2](https://www.furious.com/perfect/ooloo2.html)) from around the time of Wake Ooloo gives a bit of their story, and back story.

You can get most of Wake Ooloo's recorded output [on their Bandcamp](https://wake-ooloo.bandcamp.com/music).
