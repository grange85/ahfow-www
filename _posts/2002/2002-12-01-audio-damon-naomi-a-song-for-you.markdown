<p>It's been an absolute age since there was a D&N track of the month so here's a little live rarity for you. It's a cover of a beautiful Gram Parsons song (from his absolutely essential first solo album G.P.) and Damon & Naomi do a pretty good take on it with help from Kurihara on guitar. It was recorded in London in May 2001.</p>
