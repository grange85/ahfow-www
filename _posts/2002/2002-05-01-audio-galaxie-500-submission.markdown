<p>OK - I've been sitting on this one for an age waiting for someone to release it officially but it really doesn't seem likely so here for your enjoyment is Galaxie 500's cover of The Sex Pistols track "Submission".<br />This was recorded on October 30th 1990 at the BBC studions in Maida Vale, London (I think) and was broadcast on BBC Radio 1's John Peel Show on 4 November.<br />The session also contained an excellent cover of the Buffy St Marie track "Moonshot", a cover of the Young Marble Giants "Final Day" (that differs from the box set version in that Naomi takes the lead vocal) and "When Will You Come Home".</p>
