<p>In this occasional series I thought it would be interesting to make available the original versions of songs that have been covered by Galaxie 500, Luna or Damon & Naomi.<br />The first of these is George Harrison's "Isn't it a Pity" from his mammoth triple LP All Things Must Pass. The album had two versions of the song and this is the first and is considerably better, in my opinion, than the second.<br />The album is a very interesting one demonstrating once and for all that George had evolved into a exceptional songwriter in his own right. Sadly the over production and a certain Mr Clapton make the whole almost unlistenable in places.<br />All Things Must Pass was released as rather nicely packaged double-CD a few years back<br />Galaxie 500's version was the last track on their second album "On Fire"</p>
