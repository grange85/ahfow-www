This was the first of the two albums by Cheval Sombre released in early 2021 on Sonic Cathedral. I've already covered its partner [Days Go By](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/07/08/my-record-collection-151-cheval-sombre-days-go-by/) which was released a few months later.

Dean plays guitar on one track "I Could" and Britta plays bass on "No Place to Fall" and adds vocals to "Curtan Grove".

I do rather love the sleeves of these two albums, and the Art Nouveau typeface used which reminded me of the one on The Moody Blues [Every Good Boy Deserves Favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Good_Boy_Deserves_Favour_(album)).

The sleeves were by artist and printmaker [Craig Carry](https://www.craigcarry.net/about) based in Cork in Ireland, this is what his website says about them:

<blockquote>

<p>Both albums "Time Waits for No One" and "Days Go By" are intended as a pair: envisioned by Chris [Porpora aka Cheval Sombre] like Blake's books of innocence and experience, "…but releasing experience first, with a light at the end of the tunnel, with innocence second". Art direction is following the concept of time, with earthly/celestial journeys represented by an austere, minimal bird in flight with horizontal/vertical stained glass-like flight paths over both records.</p>

<p>Colour palette for [Time Waits For No One] inspired by the paintings of Georges Rouault, the horizontal orientation details "the sensual journey between birth and death" [...] "Days Go By" comprises the minimal austere bird flying vertically, to indicate a more heavenly, celestial journey, this celestial colour palette sourced from a magazine photo of a chapel's stained glass windows.</p>

<p>Crucially, the pair of LP covers overlap to form a super-imposed cross "linked together, suggesting the wholeness of human experience. Two birds flying in different directions, but the trail they leave behind, telling a subtle important story".</p>
