Amplexus was the first album released by Justin Harwood's MuttonGun after he left The Chills (or at least at the tail end of his tenure with The Chills) and unlike the band's [previous entry in this series](/2024/07/04/my-record-collection-150-mutton-gun-iii-with-wood/) I am fairly confident that Dean Wareham did have his fingers in this albums.

The album credits...
 - Dong Wareham - some cosmic interaction
 - Dean Wareham - galactic guitar

So it does actually mention _Dean_ and _guitar_ on the same line of credits - Dean's "galactic guitar" is on the track "Aldgate", and Dong's "cosmic interaction" is on "Das Lied f&uuml;r dong".

The album was recorded in London in 1990, so while Dean was still a member of Galaxie 500 and he appears "courtesy of Rough Trade" - I can't find any mention of Dean's MuttonGun appearance in Black Postcards, so I guess it was either not memorable enough, or not considered interesting enough to include. I do believe that Damon & Naomi were not happy with Dean moonlighting so not sure whether this was another milestone on the Galaxie 500 dissolution.

The album was "UNFORTUNATELY NOT Produced by Kramer BUT BY MuttonGun"

All three MuttonGun/Muttongun/Mutton Gun albums can be [bought/downloaded from Bandcamp](https://muttongun.bandcamp.com) for pay what you want and all three are worth throwing a few pennies at.
