This was the first of two EPs released by Luna that were both called "EP", this one was released in 1996 on Terry Tolkin's No.6 Records and contains some tracks not released elsewhere.

The opening track however is the Penthouse version of {% ahfowtrack "Seaside by the Seashore" %}, and the second track is Luna's cover of Talking Heads' {% ahfowtrack "Thank You For Sending Me an Angel" %}, that had been released the previous year on the Bonnie and Clyde single.

The next two tracks were only ever released on this EP and are both Luna rockers! I must admit it's been a while since I've listened to this EP but both of these tracks were reallly familiar - The Moviegoer has a similar feel to Rollercoaster, a song [I've dissed on a number of occasions over the years](/2012/07/25/audio-lost-tracks-lunas-rollercoaster/), I'm slowly coming round to it, but would say that The Moviegoer is better!

I like It's Bringing You Down even more. Back in 2009 John of Dream Machine Records got in touch and told me that he would be putting on the UK première of Matthew Buzzell's Tell Me Do You Miss Me in a pub back room in Brixton. After an initial postponement it finally happened on a cold December evening. After the film John and the "Dream Machine All Stars" put on a lovely and enjoyable set of Luna favourites and very surprisingly dug out this obscurity to cover.

The next track {% ahfowtrack "The Enabler" %} is also only available on this release although it will be quite familiar since it was re-purposed into {% ahfowtrack "Herringbone Tweed" %}, the track that accompanied Dennis Hopper's Screen Test in Dean & Britta's 13 Most Beautiful: Songs for Andy Warhol's Screen Tests in 2009, here they are playing it live in Pittsburgh in 2012

The final track is the cover of Tom Rush's {% ahfowtrack "No Regrets" %} that was previously released on the [23 Minutes in Brussels / Hedgehog single](/2023/05/29/my-record-collection-038-luna-hedgehog-23-minutes-in-brussels/)

The sleeve of EP is a riff on the poster for the film [Kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_(film)) which I have never seen and will never see.
