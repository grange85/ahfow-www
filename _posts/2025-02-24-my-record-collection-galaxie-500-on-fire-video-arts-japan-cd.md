This is the lovely reissue of Galaxie 500's On Fire released in 2008 by Video Arts Japan - this was one of a set of all four releases that Dean sent me around then. I've already posted about [Today](/2023/09/21/my-record-collection-071-galaxie-500-today-video-arts-japan-cd/) and [Copenhagen](/2024/01/22/my-record-collection-103-galaxie-500-copenhagen/), _This Is Our Music_ is yet to come.

Like the others...

 - It comes in a lovely LP sleeve replica
 - It has SAMPLE stamped on the inner ring of the disc
 - It has the song lyrics in English and Japanese
 - Dean has signed the OBI strip
 - It has a refreshed version of Byron Coley's box set notes... in Japanese

It also has a second set of sleeve notes written by Ryuichi Kanagawa which I do rather love (even if I only have Google Translate to help me) - I love fan writing... and this is a fan writing:

<blockquote>
<p>Three albums in three and a half years... I'm sure I'd be punished if I complained that this is not enough, but I think there was still a possibility for the Galaxie 500 sound. So, rather than looking for a post-Galaxie 500 band, I hope they'll reunite. I've never asked him directly, but even if Dean said, "We've done everything we can," I wouldn't believe him. If I ever meet Dean, I'll tell him this.</p>
<p>"Hey, you know what? Japanese fans haven't forgotten the events of that disappointing spring day even after nearly 20 years. You're not going to let it rust away in the garage, are you? I want you to restart the engine."</p>
</blockquote>

This is the sixth copy of On Fire in the series - and I have been listening to everything I can for this series, but... as my last.fm stats show I would probably be listening to it this much anyway!

_&dagger; -  lastfm doesn't catch all my cd or vinyl plays which accounts for a lot of my Galaxie 500 listening. This is why my listening appears to tail off after the [reissues](/2009/12/14/galaxie-500-albums-to-be-reissued-in-march-2010/) in March 2010! Although how last.fm could possibly think I only listened to three tracks from On Fire all last year is a bit of a mystery. I can assure you I listened to it a lot more than that! I try to [scrobble my non-digital listening too](https://www.openscrobbler.com) - but am not always that diligent!_
