These are two double CD compilations released on Mind Expansion Records - the first in 2006 and the second a couple of years later. Rather quaintly both had MySpace URLs on the back.

Mind Expansion was the label of Fuxa main man Randall Nieman and so both sets are packed with the spacey goodness you would expect from that. On the first compilation Dean & Britta provide their [cover of Dennis Wilson's Forever](/2013/07/03/originals-forever-by-the-beach-boys-covered-by-dean-britta/) that previously was released on a Starbucks CD in 2005 (which shockingly (as of now) **won't** be turning up in this series) - and the second set has Dean guesting with Fuxa on their cover of Suicide's Cheree, as released on [Fuxa Commits Suicide](/2024/03/25/my-record-collection-121-fuxa-commits-suicide-cd/) (also on Mind Expansion) in 2007.

I bought both from direct from Randall about the time of release one for $20 (including postage) and one with another CD (Suki Ewers' Kind of Hazy) for $35 (including postage).

Both sets have 32 tracks each, and a lot of great stuff there is... but, if you buy them digitally you get a whole lot more - with 50 tracks on #1 and 49 on #2 - which is a bit of a treat since they're available for _name your price_ a.k.a. _pay what you can_!
