The Guardian today has [a piece on Slowcore](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/aug/02/glacial-pleasures-of-slowcore-codeine-duster) that discusses Galaxie 500 and has some contributions from Dean Wareham.

> We were not trying to make people dance, we were not trying to ‘rock’ – we were trying to make things that were beautiful.
