This is a CD version of the expanded Uncollected that was released a couple of years back and was bought as a collection filler direct from Damon & Naomi a couple of months after the release of the LP versions - I've already [written about the two copies of that](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/10/08/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-09-and-10-galaxie-500-uncollected-noise-new-york-88-90/)

Since I have two LP versions, and a digital download (since I bought one of the LP versions via Bandcamp) there was no real reason to take this out of it's shrink-wrap... but, I just have because I guess there's no real reason not to.

I probably haven't listened to this through since I listened to the LPs when they first arrived... this sort of album isn't really an _album_ and so isn't really something that requires listening to as one. The tracks weren't recorded as an album they only live together through the coincidence that at the time of recording they weren't considered worthy of release, or had a different purpose. 

Of course to a fan everything is worthy of a release because everything on this release is a historical artefact. So it exists for the fan, although I guess a boutique/deluxe release like this hopes to trawl in a few non fans, but surely no one who bought this wasn't already familiar with all of the bands output? The problem of course is that if it was for the fan why wasn't it complete?

Anyway... the CD package is a nice card gatefold sleeve that is identical to the LP version (only smaller) - no designer ever really mastered how to release double CDs - think of all those horrid fat jewel cases, or the ones with the flimsy extra flap inside. The card sleeve is as close as you can get - although having the discs slot in from the middle is I think a mistake that invites damage.

There were a couple of tracks on the album that I hadn't had bootlegs of before, Never Get to Heaven was one, in the booklet Dean suggests that it "almost sounds like a parody" - but maybe that's why I like it although it does end sooner and more abruptly than I think I'd have liked.
