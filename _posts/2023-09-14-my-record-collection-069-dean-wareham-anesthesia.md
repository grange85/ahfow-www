This is the copy of Anesthesia I bought in early 1992, although I've [already covered how relieved I was](/2023/07/13/my-record-collection-051-dean-wareham-anesthesia/) when it came out, in the entry on the CD copy I bought later.

This was certainly bought before I [saw Luna at The Underworld]() on their first visit to London in 1992 because I remember Justin saying "thanks for coming out, without having a record" during the gig... and thinking... "well... I sort of _do_ have a record".

I always get a bit confused by the sleeve of this... I can't see the woman's face when I'm holding the record, only when I see it from across the room, or in photographs. A ghost. I'm not sure she's there until I move away!

So... since I've covered all that let's talk about _Tomato Poodle_. 

Anesthesia and I Can't Wait were recorded during the Fun City sessions by Wharton Tiers in July 1991 and both were later re-recorded by Luna for their first album. Tomato Poodle however: 
 - doesn't get a mention on the sleeve.
 - isn't on the No.6 release of Anesthesia.
 - doesn't put in an appearance on the Luna Demos bandcamp release.
 - or on the Luna Demos LP release.
 - or on the deluxe Lunapark double LP.
 - doesn't (to my ears) appear to have developed into anything else.

Nope - its only appearance is here, tucked on the b-side of this 12" single, and the third track on [the CD version](/2023/07/13/my-record-collection-051-dean-wareham-anesthesia/), oh and on they Mint Humbucker compilation of Mint/Jungle releases (which I'll come to later).

OK, it is just some Dean Wareham noodling but lets face it, Dean noodling is not really _just_ anything.

I can't remember where I bought this - I'm thinking Selectadisc, almost certainly a West End record shop, shortly after release.
