Dean has appeared giving a lengthy interviews to a couple of podcasts:

The second (of three) parts of Discograffiti's deep dive into Galaxie 500 albums has just been [released to Patreon subscribers](https://www.patreon.com/posts/206-directors-of-128321020) (or you can pay a one off for it). This episode looks at their second (and best??) album On Fire and contains ten extra minutes not in the free version:

<blockquote>
    <p>Here’s just a few of the many things that Dean discusses with Discograffiti in Part Two of this podcast</p>
    <p>Our many wayward tales of dropping acid and wandering around Cambridge, Mass.;</p> 
    <ul>
    <li>Exactly how many songs are inspired by LSD on their sophomore record;</li>
    <li>The nature of the disagreement that practically broke them up for good before the release of their debut;</li>
    <li>The question Sonic Boom had for Dean;</li>
    <li>Dean’s in-the-moment realization that the Blue Thunder EP was an unintentional suicidal depression concept piece;</li>
    <li>And a track-by-track rundown of On Fire!</li>
    </ul>

The free version of Discograffiti is released [on Friday via YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@discograffitipodcast2872/videos) or your podcast provider of choice.

Dean also appears on [Aquarium Drunkard's Transmissions podcast](https://aquariumdrunkard.com/2025/05/07/transmissions-dean-wareham/) talking to Jason Woodbury about the new(ish) album and other things - this seems to be behind Aquarium Drunkard's paywall but I did manage to listen to it on the [Talkhouse page](https://www.talkhouse.com/transmissions-dean-wareham/) and it is [also on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2fYbb452SMTmFKeqtlTOfE?si=Sedmi14cTQqGc2zcVu6m3w)... and may be available elsewhere.

<blockquote>
Do you ever connect with an old friend and find that, despite however many years it's been, you pick up right where you left off, as if no time has passed at all? That’s sort of what happened between today’s guest, Dean Wareham and producer Kramer in the making of Dean’s new album, That’s the Price of Loving Me.
