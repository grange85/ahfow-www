Following on from the earlier post 'The Cassette Converter' has shared another Galaxie 500 video from an unknown date and venue. The sound is fairly good, the video is very rough.

[Galaxie 500 - Live, VHS Rip, Unknown Venue, Unknown Date](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkGcOCI8n_U)

If anyone has any clues as to the date of the venue [please shout](/about/)!

Here's my half-baked analysis.

- Short setlist and Dean mentions that Kramer is coming on stage at 8:59 -  which is early so probably a support slot?
- No songs from This Is Our Music - so probably early 1990 at the latest?
- Kramer joins them on stage for the last two songs - Victory Garden and Ceremony.
- I know that Kramer was on the tour supporting The Sundays in early 1990, and he was joining them on-stage for Ceremony.
- Kramer was also on the co-headliner with Straitjacket Fits in Europe, so... could also be that??

My money's on it being from the tour with The Sundays - but more based on guesswork and not any real evidence.
