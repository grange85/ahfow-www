As I [mentioned previously](/2023/11/16/my-record-collection-087-luna-bobby-peru-7/) Bobby Peru was probably an early example of me walking out of a shop with the same release on two different formats (although there is [an example from 1984](https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2024/03/01/60-albums-1984-motorhead-no-remorse/)).

As well as the lead track, and _Bob le Flambeur_ that was on the seven inch, the CD has the cover of Blondie's _In The Flesh_ (previously [released as a single](/2024/07/18/my-record-collection-154-luna-in-the-flesh/)) and a demo version of Beggar's Bliss that I think only ever saw the light of day on this release.
