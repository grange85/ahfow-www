Less than a month ago I was already [clearly struggling with words](/2024/12/12/my-record-collection-196-galaxie-500-this-is-our-music-rough-trade-lp/) for the releases that repeatedly reappear... and here's _another_ This Is Our Music and there are four more to come. Perhaps I could have a wee moan about the multiple coloured variants that started appearing from late 2019... but [I've already done that](/2023/06/19/my-record-collection-044-galaxie-500-today/)! Luckily I did resist the last [batch of coloured reissues](/2023/02/23/new-coloured-vinyl-galaxie-500-releases/).

But, this one was in that first phase of Newbury Comics exclusives so I bought a copy. It was pricey, and became more pricey when the HM Revenue & Customs spotted it entering the country and slapped duty on it, which the GPO then charged a fee on top of for collecting that duty!

It was described as being "blue swirl" vinyl, but no _swirl_ on my copy, just a few vague grey smudges - although I think I prefer that to some of the _swirl_ vinyl records I have.
