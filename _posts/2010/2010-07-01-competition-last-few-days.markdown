<div>Last few days to enter the Fourth of July competition. <a href="/2010/06/20/fourth-of-july-competition-2010/">Details and "rules" can be found over here</a> but in short - create some "art" inspired by the Galaxie 500 song Fourth of July, send it to me - and me and my family will spend your independence day picking the one (or ones) we like best. Then I&#39;ll send the winner (or winners) some stuff I have. The "stuff" will mostly be CDs but will probably include a copy of Dear Paulina 7" (if required and if I can find one kicking around - it might not have a picture sleeve).
<p /> Here would be my entry if I were allowed to enter my own competition - I&#39;m sure you can do better!<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/4750361122/"><img src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4750361122_2b776b9771.jpg" border="0" height="395" width="500" /></a>
