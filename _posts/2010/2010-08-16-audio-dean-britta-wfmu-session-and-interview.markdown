<div>Just after returning from their 13 Most Beautiful show in London Dean & Britta popped into <a href="http://www.wfmu.org">WFMU</a> for an interview for the show <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/MN">Underwater Theme Park</a> with Meghan. They performed a three song set comprising I&#039;ll Keep it with Mine, I Found it Not So, and Galaxie 500&#039;s Hearing Voices. They also chatted at length about 13 Most Beautiful, Galaxie 500 and anything else that popped up. The interview is lovingly punctuated with Meghan&#039;s laughter.
<p /> You can <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/36894">hear the show and see the playlist on the WFMU site</a> - zip through to about 1hr 15mins in for the session and interview (here&#039;s a <span class="removed_link" title="http://mp3archives.wfmu.org/archive/kdb/mp3jump2010.mp3/0:7:6/0/MN/mn100812.mp3">direct link to the mp3 of the full show</span>).
