<div>Great Pop Supplement are releasing a Dean & Britta 7" single containing two tracks from 13 Most Beautiful. The single will be released on 26 July and couples the cover of Bob Dylan&#039;s I&#039;ll Keep it With Mine with It Don&#039;t Rain in Beverly Hills. Manchester (UK) indie store <a href="http://www.piccadillyrecords.com/products/DeanBritta-I%E2%80%99llKeepItWithMineItDon%E2%80%99tRainInBeverlyHills-TheGreatPopSupplement-70716.html">Piccadilly Records have it available for pre-order</a> but I suspect it&#039;ll arrive in a dealer near you in the not too distant future. As soon as I find some artwork and any more news of other stores stocking it I&#039;ll let you know.
