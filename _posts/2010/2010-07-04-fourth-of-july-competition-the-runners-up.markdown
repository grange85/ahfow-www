<p>Thanks to everyone who entered or thought about entering the A Head Full of Wishes competition. In the end there were four entries - all were wonderful and choosing a winner was really hard and I wanted to make everyone a winner but sadly I don't have enough stuff to give away! I do have some copies of Luna's Dear Paulina 7" so if any runners up want a copy give me a shout...</p>
<p>So here are the runners up in no particular order...</p>
<p><strong>Runner Up: Michael Korchia</strong> - <em>But I feel alright when you smile...</em></p>

<p><strong>Runner up: Paul Schuster</strong> - <em>Eichler won't even look at the biscuit<br /> </em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em></em></div>
<p><strong>Runner up: <span>Roc&iacute;o Ortiz Garc&iacute;a</span></strong> - <em>Maybe I should just change my style, but, when he smiles, I feel alright</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
