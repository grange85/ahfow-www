<p>And the winner is...</p>
<p>Simon Mealor's song The Fourth of July Still Plays in My Heart. It was lovely to get a musical entry and one that's been done so well. The excellently reverential backing track and the sweet narrative in the lyrics is just wonderful. Here's how Simon described it...</p>
<blockquote><p>Inspired by teaching in a French high school in the Normandy countryside in 1991 with only three cassettes to listen to for a year --- ‘On Fire / This is Our Music’ copied off vinyl onto one C90, The Cowboy Junkies’ ‘Trinity Session’ and Rolling Stones’ ‘More Hot Rocks (Big Hits and Fazed Cookies)’.</p></blockquote>

<p>Simon wins a small bunch of CDs and 7" singles including a copy of Luna's Dear Paulina 7" (with a sleeve!); a copy of the Luna <a href="/database/release/roundup/">RoundUp promo</a>; a copy of Dean & Britta's He's Coming Home 7" and a few other unrelated things I have kicking around.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who took the time to enter the competition and I look forward to five entries next year.</p>
<p><em>If you celebrate the Fourth of July have fun, be safe and enjoy the fireworks!</em></p>
