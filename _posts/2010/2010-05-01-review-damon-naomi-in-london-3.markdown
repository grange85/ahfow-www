<div>OK, &quot;review&quot; might be a bit grand for what is about to follow... it&#39;s late and I&#39;m exhausted so just a quickie...
<p />Another very lovely Damon &amp; Naomi gig. Amor de Dias (Alasdiar Clientele and Lupe Pipas) opened with a sweet set. Damon &amp; Naomi opened with Blue Moon in honour of Alex Chilton and played through an hour long set of old, new and very old. The &quot;new&quot; were a couple of songs being readied for the next album. the &quot;old&quot; was a selection of Damon &amp; Naomi gems, and &quot;very old&quot; was a stunningly beautiful cover of Blue Thunder that saw them joined by Alasdair MacLean and James Hornsey of The Clientele on guitar and bass - stunning.
