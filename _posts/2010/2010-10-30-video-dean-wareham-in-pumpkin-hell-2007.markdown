<p>So... Hallowe'en comes around again and again it seemed apt to dig out Dean Wareham's performance in Pumpkin Hell. Sadly the film appears to have <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.ifc.com/videos/pumpkin-hell.php">gone AWOL from the IFC site</span> where it was previously hosted. Luckily I've managed to track down a copy and present it here for your delectation</p>
<p>The film was made in 2007 by <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.finneranfilms.com">Max Finneran</span> and is...</p>
<blockquote><p>a short coming-of-age horror film about sons, fathers and the roles they play and imagine for one another.  Abandoned by his father at a highway-side pumpkin patch, an eleven year-old boy spends a peculiar and life changing night with the misfit proprietor of the patch. </p></blockquote>
