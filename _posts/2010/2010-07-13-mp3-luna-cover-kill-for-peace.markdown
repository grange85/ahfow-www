<div>I heard today that Tuli Kupferberg of The Fugs died earlier this week. On 20 March 2003 Bush and Blair invaded Iraq on spurious grounds. Luna covered Tuli Kupferberg&#039;s Kill for Peace at their Knitting Factory shows on the 20th and 21st of March 2003 - This recording is from the 11pm show on the 21st.
<p /> MP3: <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/3xropqis31">Luna - Kill For Peace</a> (via <a href="http://box.net">box.net</a>)
<p />You can hear Tuli doing an <a href="http://www.vietnamsongbook.org/setlist_jp.htm">unaccompanied performance of Kill for Peace at the Vietnam Songbook show earlier that month</a> (also check out <a href="http://www.vietnamsongbook.org/mp3/05%20-%20Dean%20Wareham-%20No%20Train%20To%20Stockholm%20.mp3">Dean Wareham doing No Train to Stockholm</a> while you&#039;re there).
<p /> And here&#039;s Tuli with The Fugs<br />
