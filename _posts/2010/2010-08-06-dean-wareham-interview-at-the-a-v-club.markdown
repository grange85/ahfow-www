<div>The A.V. Club has an interview with Dean Wareham covering the two roads that Dean &amp; Britta are currently going down.
<p />On 13 Most Beautiful...<br />
<blockquote>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote"> I’m not sure I would’ve actually liked to be hanging around the Factory. I have something of a work ethic—well, those people did too, I guess, because they were on spee [...] Sometimes you hear about these people in these incredibly productive periods where they’re just working all the time. It’s the same with Bob Dylan. How’d he do this? Then you find out they were on speed. You’re sleeping four hours a night, and I’m sure it can make you very productive for a short period. Obviously then it destroys some people as well. </p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And the upcoming shows playing Galaxie 500 songs<br />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote"> I know I get a real kick, an emotional charge, out of playing a song I haven’t played for 10 years. It just takes you back to that point in your life. I think I should’ve been playing more of these songs all along [...] <br /> The songs are more difficult to play than I remember. I listened to the live Galaxie 500 album from Copenhagen, and I realized that’s at the end of a tour, after we had been touring for a couple of months and had gotten pretty good at it. In terms of chord structure, the songs are incredibly simple. For example, a song like “Don’t Let Our Youth Go To Waste” is only one chord, but there’s a whole lot going on in it. </p></blockquote>
