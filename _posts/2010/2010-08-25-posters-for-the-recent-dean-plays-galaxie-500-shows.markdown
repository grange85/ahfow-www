<div><span class="post-author vcard"><span class="fn">James Flames, </span></span>the artist of these two lovely posters for the recent Dean Wareham plays Galaxie 500 shows in New York and Philadelphia has just <a href="http://pitilli.blogspot.com/2010/08/deam-wareham-plays-galaxie-500-x2.html">posted about how he created them</a>. You can also <a href="http://www.jamesflames.com/store.html">buy limited edition numbered and signed copies of the posters directly from him</a>.
<p />
<div style="text-align: center;">&quot;The ideas for these came about pretty naturally. For the NYC poster, I actually came up with the title first, and the image just kinda appeared on the page after a quick sketch.&quot;<br /><b>(Now That Enough Time Has Passed) It&#39;s Safe To Go Back Again</b><br />
<p /> &quot;For the Philly show, I had just finished a sketchbook piece <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_UXlGz0s5748/TEHCESKHgEI/AAAAAAAABgs/yULE10xO4XA/s1600/10-06-22-HelloAgainGoodbyeAgain-880.jpg" class="flower_imagebox" target="_blank">(which I&#39;ve posted before here)</a>, and I thought this would be a great opportunity to bring it to life as a screen print.&quot;<br /> <b>Hello Again / Goodbye Again</b><br />  </div>
