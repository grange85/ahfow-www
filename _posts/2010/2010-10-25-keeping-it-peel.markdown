<p>Today is the 6th anniversary of the death of John Peel. Here's what  wrote on this site back then...</p>
<blockquote><p>The great man died – I’ll miss him. He’s been a part of my life for 20+ years. Knowing that he was around was reassuring even if there were times when I drifted away from listening to his show.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is still sorely missed. Go put on a Peel session of your choice maybe one of these...</p>
