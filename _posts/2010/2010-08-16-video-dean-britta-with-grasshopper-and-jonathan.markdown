Here's a wonderful video of Dean & Britta performing with Mercury Rev's Grasshopper and Jonathan Donohue on the [Mystery Spot](http://www.mysteryspotvintage.com/) front porch on Sunday. First up is a cover of Galaxie 500's Snowstorm and then Mercury Rev's Car Wash Hair (which featured Dean on guitar when it was released as a single all those years ago!)
