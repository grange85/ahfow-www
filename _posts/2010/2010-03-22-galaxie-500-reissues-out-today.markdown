<p>The deluxe reissues of Galaxie 500's three albums are released today by Domino Records. Each CD is paired with a bonus CD: Today comes with the "Uncollected" set that was collected for the 1996 box set; On Fire has the band's two Peel sessions; This Is Our Music has the live recording from Galaxie 500's last European show in Copenhagen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/11/galaxie-500-cd-review">Alexis Petridis in The Guardian</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>No one is currently offering Galaxie 500's melange of trebly guitar, serpentine basslines, fragile vocals and oddly jazz-inflected drumming (This Is Our Music borrowed its title from Ornette Coleman). Certainly, no one currently sounds like singer Dean Wareham. Listening to his high voice floating wildly off-key in a way that simply wouldn't be allowed these days for fear of upsetting daytime radio play, you're reminded of a vanished age before Auto-Tune, when alt-rock's aims and ambitions and audience were noticeably different.</p></blockquote>
<p>The albums are available in <a href=" http://dominorecordco.com/artists/galaxie-500/">deluxe double CD packs, LPs</a> (no bonus discs) or as <a href="http://digital.dominorecordco.com/search/?artist=Galaxie+500">digital downloads</a>.</p>
