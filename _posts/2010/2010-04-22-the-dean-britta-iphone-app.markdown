<div>Britta has been working adding content to the official Dean & Britta iPhone app (va iLike).Â  I don&#39;t have an iPhone so have no idea on how it&#39;s doing but for a few pennies it could be worth checking out...
<p /> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/dean-britta-official-app/id318593334?mt=8">Visit iTunes to check out the official Dean & Britta iPhone app</a>
<p /><span class="removed_link" title="http://www.ilike.com/artist/Dean+%2526+Britta">Visit Dean & Britta&#39;s iLike page</span> to get a clue as to what might be on the app
<p />  - I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s more than one photo on it now!
