<div>A show billed as "Dean Wareham plays Galaxie 500" is taking place at <a href="http://www.badearl.com/">The Earl in Atlanta, GA</a> on the 17 September. I&#39;d hazard a guess that this is not, as <a href="http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=49797254&blogId=533878250">suggested on the promoter&#39;s MySpace page</a> "the first time in 20 years" but similar to the Dean & Britta Galaxie 500 shows in New York, Castellon and Paris in the last couple of years. Still a not too common occurrence. Tickets are on sale now at $18 and given current Pitchfork love for Galaxie 500 and the fact that they have <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/38766-dean-wareham-to-play-galaxie-500-songs-at-one-off-atlanta-show/">just plugged this show</a> it might be worth getting your tickets in advance!
