A couple of videos of complete songs from Dean & Britta's secret Copenhagen show from 2007 have just appeared on YouTube. 

First them doing Luna's Chinatown

If you look back through the [morkygorky's earlier videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/morkygorky) you can find some short clips of other songs from the show earlier in the day.
