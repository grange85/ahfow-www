<p>There's a rather lovely five star <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/11/galaxie-500-cd-review">review of the Galaxie 500 reissues in The Guardian by Alexis Petridis</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Heard 20 years on, Today, On Fire and This Is Our Music prove not every aspect of that era's indie rock as been stripmined in recent years. No one is currently offering Galaxie 500's melange of trebly guitar, serpentine basslines, fragile vocals and oddly jazz-inflected drumming (This Is Our Music borrowed its title from Ornette Coleman). Certainly, no one currently sounds like singer Dean Wareham. Listening to his high voice floating wildly off-key in a way that simply wouldn't be allowed these days for fear of upsetting daytime radio play, you're reminded of a vanished age before Auto-Tune, when alt-rock's aims and ambitions and audience were noticeably different.</p></blockquote>
