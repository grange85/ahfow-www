<div>So you&#39;re thinking of maybe entering the <a href="/2010/06/20/fourth-of-july-competition-2010/">A Head Full of Wishes Fourth of July competition</a> but aren&#39;t really sure of what to make of it all, here are a few videos for inspiration...
<p /> First up see what some kids made of the video... (it was kinda wack)<br /><figure class="caption "><figcaption class="caption-text"></figcaption></figure>
<p />... and here&#39;s the video they watched...<br /> <figure class="caption "><figcaption class="caption-text"></figcaption></figure>
<p />... and here&#39;s Luna covering it... <br /><figure class="caption "><figcaption class="caption-text"></figcaption></figure>
<p /> ... and you can hear (but barely see) Dean &amp; Britta covering it...<br /><figure class="caption "><figcaption class="caption-text"></figcaption></figure>
