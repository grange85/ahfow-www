<div>The latest update from Damon & Naomi is short and sweet - it mentions their two upcoming US shows at the Homegrown II festival in Jamaica Plain, MA and with Masaki Batoh in Brooklyn. Also the news that the songs for the next album are "in place".
<p /> They&#39;ll be heading to Europe in December - keep an eye on the A Head Full of Wishes upcoming shows page (there are a couple of Euro dates there already and more will be added as soon as I hear of them).
