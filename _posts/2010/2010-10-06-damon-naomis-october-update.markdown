<div>The latest update from Damon & Naomi is short and sweet - it mentions their two upcoming US shows at the <span class="removed_link" title="https://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/wiki/Shows/Damon_%26_Naomi/2010-10-15">Homegrown II festival in Jamaica Plain, MA</span> and with <span class="removed_link" title="https://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/wiki/Shows/Damon_%26_Naomi/2010-10-29">Masaki Batoh in Brooklyn</span>. Also the news that the songs for the next album are "in place".
<p /> They&#39;ll be heading to Europe in December - keep an eye on the <span class="removed_link" title="https://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/wiki/Shows#Damon_.26_Naomi">A Head Full of Wishes upcoming shows page</span> (there are a couple of Euro dates there already and more will be added as soon as I hear of them).
