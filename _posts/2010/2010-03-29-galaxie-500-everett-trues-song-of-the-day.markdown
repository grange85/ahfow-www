<p>Unbeknownst to <a href="http://everetttrue2.blogspot.com/">Everett True</a> (or at least it was until I <a href="http://twitter.com/grange85/statuses/11240226237">tweeted him and told him so</a>) he probably played a significant part in the very existence of A Head Full of Wishes. When <a href="/1991/05/04/galaxie-500-split/">Galaxie 500 split</a> in 1991 I was pretty much the only Galaxie 500 fan I knew and it was only the writing of ET that made me aware that other folk missed them as much as I did. Without that reassurance I'm pretty certain that I might not have bothered to create <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk">this web site</a> in 1994 (and the <a href="/mailing-list/">mailing list</a> the following year).</p>
<p>ET has just made Galaxie 500 his <a href="http://everetttrue2.blogspot.com/2010/03/song-of-day-43-galaxie-500.html">Song of the Day on the excellent (and wonderfully inflammatory) blog "Music That I Like"</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The bass was pure 'Ceremony'-era Joy Division, of course, and nothing wrong with that. The drums were as responsive as I'd yet to witness in a rock band. The guitar solos increased the feeling of distance, of loneliness. The lyrics... well, I never could quite get my head around their pleasing mundaneness. I always figured they had to be something more (and even to this day remain unconvinced that they're not).</p></blockquote>
