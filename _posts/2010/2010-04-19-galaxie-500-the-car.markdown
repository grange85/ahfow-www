<div>Many years ago when I put together the <a href="/2006/01/29/galaxie-500-and-related-artists-faq-out-of-date/">(very long neglected) FAQ</a> for the web page I included the question &quot;What is a Galaxie 500?&quot; and for a while actually had trouble finding a picture of the car to include as evidence of where the band pinched their name. Eventually someone sent me a picture, and then I started just linking to the Yahoo! category (remember, from the days when Yahoo! was a directory!) I never, knowingly, saw one in real life until the <a href="http://www.goodwood.co.uk/site/content/revival/Welcome.aspx">Goodwood Revival</a> in 2002
<p />Nowadays the car is better represented on the web than the band - most (new) &quot;Galaxie 500&quot; pictures on Flickr and videos on YouTube are of the car. It doesn&#39;t bother me, maybe because, despite not being the sort of person who cares about cars (don&#39;t own one, don&#39;t want to) I quite like looking at these gas-guzzling monstrosities from an era when a car could look individual and no one cared what damage it might do to the environment.
<p /> Anyway I do like looking and I mostly like looking at the logos - so i put together a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/galleries/72157623767017895/">gallery on flickr of some of my favourite pictures of the varied Galaxie 500 logos</a>...
<p /> Here&#39;s a picture of my son Adam patiently appeasing his boring old man by posing next to a Galaxie 500 in 2003...<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/4535593823/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2804/4535593823_2e6c35e8da.jpg" border="0" height="375" width="500" /></a>
