<p>Dean has just <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=814">posted to the deanandbritta.com blog</a> commenting on their recent shows (which included appearances from Lee Wall and Sean Eden of Luna - although not both at the same time) and mentions their forthcoming shows in the UK.</p>
<p>They've also found a box of copies of the <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/wiki/He%27s_Coming_Home/Old_Toy_Trains">excellent Christmas 7"</span> from a couple of years ago and they're <a href="http://deanandbritta.11spot.com/">for sale from the online store</a>.</p>
