<p>Dean has just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101206+/http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=814">posted to the deanandbritta.com blog</a> commenting on their recent shows (which included appearances from Lee Wall and Sean Eden of Luna - although not both at the same time) and mentions their forthcoming shows in the UK.</p>
<p>They've also found a box of copies of the excellent Christmas 7" from a couple of years ago and they're <a href="http://deanandbritta.11spot.com/">for sale from the online store</a>.</p>
