<p>Back in 2008 I launched a new competition for art about or inspired by Galaxie 500's track Fourth of July. The first year was met with embarrassing silence and a grand total of zero entries. For 2009 I decided that the lack of a prize may have contributed to the competition's pathetic failure and decided to offload some duplicate CDs to the winning entry... and sure enough egged on by some of my off-casts the number of entries soared and the <a href="/2009/07/04/fourth-of-july-competition-winners/">competiton was so fierce that in the end I made <strong>both entries</strong> winners</a>!</p>
<p>So... welcome to year 3 of the AHFoW Fourth of July contest. The winning piece of art will, once again win a collection of crap that I have around that will probably include a couple of CDs and anything else I may be able to rustle up between now and then [<a href="/2010/06/20/donations-of-competition-prizes-gratefully-received/">prize donors welcome</a>].</p>
<p><strong>The Rules</strong></p>
<p><em>Create a piece of art about or inspired by the Galaxie 500 song Fourth of July</em> so, for example, it could be...</p>
<ul>
<li>Poems about dog biscuits</li>
<li>Photos of poems on dog biscuits</li>
<li>Photos of small Empire State Buildings...</li>
<li>... or large nickels</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="/database/track/25/">lyrics are in the database</a> and the song is <a href="http://hypem.com/#/track/856807/Galaxie+500+-+Fourth+Of+July">in a million places</a> <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1bmcs_galaxie-500-4th-of-july_music">on the internet</a> - go hunt it down... and let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p>If entries are so copious that I have to categorise them they will fall into two broad categories...</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual art (e.g. paintings, drawings, photographs, sculptures, videos)</li>
<li>Everything else (e.g. poems, stories, songs)</li>
</ul>
<p>The winner will be chosen by me and my family and will be based on a number of criteria, most of which will have more to do with what makes us laugh (or cry) than jaw-dropping artistic-brilliance (although that would be appreciated too of course). It's just for a laugh so have some fun.</p>
<p>Entries in <a href="mailto:andy@grange85.co.uk">email</a>, or as links to web sites (e.g. blogs/Flickr/YouTube etc.) or in the comments here if you prefer!</p>
<p>Competition closes on 3 July and winners will be announced on the 4th.</p>
