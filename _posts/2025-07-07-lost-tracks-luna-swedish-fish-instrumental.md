I just came across this from 15 years ago again - it's a sweet instrumental version of Luna's Swedish Fish that is being used in a trailer promoting this equally lovely children's book "Seasons" by [French illustrator Blexbolex](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/misc/seasons-blexbolex-enchanted-lion.jpg).

It should probably be filed in the [lost tracks](/category/lost-tracks) category since this was (to my knowledge) its only _release_. I've also popped an mp3 version here:
