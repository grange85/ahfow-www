Cherry Red Records have been trotting out these extensive compilations for a number of years (as have some other reissue/legacy labels like Ace and Two Piers and Rough Trade) and I suspect AHFoW related acts have been sprinkled around many similar collections. Both Galaxie 500 and Luna turn up on this one, which is subtitled _1988-1995 A Story of Shoegaze_. I'll spare you a discussion on my opinions of music pigeonholing - but imagine me rolling my eyes!

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/various-artists-still-in-a-dream.jpg" "Still in a Dream (CD)" %}

I guess I bought this comp, and none of the others because:
 1. It has a pretty good tracklisting across its five CDs
 2. It has tracks by both Galaxie 500 _and_ Luna, and also a track by The Belltower (one of Britta's pre-Luna bands)

Obviously Galaxie 500's and Luna's contributions aren't anything I don't already have... multiple times. So I guess reason #1 is the best reason to have this collection.

The collection is packaged as a book and had a lengthy essay on shoegaze (that doesn't mention Galaxie 500) by Neil Taylor - and little puff pieces on each track, neither the Galaxie 500 or Luna ones have anything insightful to say so are not worth me copying them down!

So... just because - I'm going to pick my three favourite tracks from each of the five discs&dagger;!

### Disc 1
 - Galaxie 500 - Tugboat (obv)
 - Kitchens of Distinction - The 3rd Time We Opened the Capsule
 - Pale Saints - The Sight of You

{% ahfowvideo "XiSKxvmd1bg" "Pale Saints - The Sight of You" %}

### Disc 2
 - Lush - De-Luxe
 - Cranes - Inescapable
 - Bleach - Decadence

{% ahfowvideo "o6crm4Pdtl8" "Bleach - Decadence" "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/bleach-decadence.jpg" %}

### Disc 3
 - Th' Faith Healers - Gorgeous Blue Flower in My Garden
 - Spiritualized - Run
 - Curve - Ten Little Girls

{% ahfowvideo "XSwJYEKgkLM" "Curve - Ten Little Girls" "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/curve-ten-little-girls.jpg" %}

### Disc 4
 - Swallow - Sugar Your Mind
 - Spectrum - True Love Will Find You in the End
 - The Belltower - In Hollow

{% ahfowvideo "J-G-rjXbx2Y" "The Belltower - In Hollow" "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/the-belltower-in-hollow-plus.jpg" %}

_OK I picked this video (which does have In Hollow towards the end), for other reasons - as follows:_
 - _Outshine the Sun (which is better than In Hollow)_
 - _Britta looking gorgeous with dark hair!_
 - _Britta making eggy bread!_


### Disc 5
 - Drugstore - Alive
 - Luna - 23 Minutes in Brussels
 - Seefeel - Plainsong

{% ahfowvideo "iYxwUmujDgE" "Seefeel - Plainsong" %}

_Plainsong is from Seefeel's masterpiece **Quique** and is the best track on this album (with the obvious exception(s))_

_&dagger; Restricting myself to three per disc means no room for so many great bands - also I could easily have picked different tracks on each run through - I haven't though too hard about this!_
