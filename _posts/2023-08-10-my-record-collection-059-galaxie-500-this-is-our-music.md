So, we arrive at another copy of This Is Our Music, and another _limited edition_ release I didn't get on first release. This is a CD in a card slip-case and a fancy tri-fold card sleeve. Uniquely&dagger; the CD also has a different sleeve, without the portraits and without the record label and barcode on the front cover.

Leaving off the portraits seems to be rather an odd decision as it leaves a blank gold stretch on the front cover and looks unfinished, almost like a mistake. The portraits do appear, larger in the middle of the fold-out.

The other three panels of the fold out are three selections from the same set as the one that appears on the back of the normal release. They are described in the sleeve notes thus:

It appears that Mr Agony is actually a pseudonym for band collaborator Sergio Huidor and that's his shoulder that can be seen in the middle picture. Some other shots from the session can be found in the Temperature's Rising books where Naomi describes them...

> I always liked how you can see Sergio's reflection in the top left photo, on the far right of the image. He was using my Rolleiflex and is looking down at the ground glass to frame the photo.
