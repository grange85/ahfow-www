This is the first of two promo CDs I have for Dear Diary, this one was put out by Beggars Banquet around the time of the release of The Days of Our Nights and includes their cover of Guns 'n' Roses' _Sweet Child o' Mine_ as a b-side (a thing it was originally destined to be) before Elektra suggested adding it to the album, which the band did before then being dropped by Elektra.

Luna debuted their cover of _Sweet Child..._ at their 1998 New Year's Eve show at The Knitting Factory. Adam, from the Galaxie 500 Mailing List was there and was rather blown away by the cover:

<blockquote>
<p>I saw Luna new years eve at the Knitting Factory. their version of 'Sweet
Child o' Mine' was incredible. I was standing there in disbelief that they
were playing it, but then I realized that it really is a great song and
Luna's version is by far the better.</p>

<p>I'm predicting it's release as a single and Luna having a huge hit on their
hands for the first time. Expect a media build up to this album also with
Dean the boys probably doing more soundtracks and more magazines.</p>
</blockquote>

It's a good cover but sadly not the breakthrough that Adam predicted!

The third track on the CD is _Requiem for a Mouse_ which was originally planned to be included on _Days..._ but was dropped quite late on. Some Elektra promos went out with it inlcuded, but otherwise its only official outing was on this CD, which I guess means this probably should also be in my [lost tracks](/category/lost-tracks/) category.

Everytime I hear it I'm reminded of the John Cameron/Frog [soundtrack to fab pulpy horror film Pyschomania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9BguJcDJT0).

I can't remember where I got this but have a feeling that, despite it being a promo, Beggars were selling copies on their website so think I maybe got it there. Actually the only clue that it is a promo is the **P** on th end of the catalogue number.
