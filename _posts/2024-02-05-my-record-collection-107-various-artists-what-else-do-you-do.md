This is one of two copies of _What Else Do You Do (a compilation of quiet music)_ this is the Shimmy Disc release and comes in a... salmon(?) coloured sleeve. It contains Dean Wareham's first recording of _Smile_ - a track that later turned up on Lunapark.

The album contains all the usual Shimmy Disc suspects - Pale Face, Bongwater, The Tinklers, Dogbowl, Tuli Kupferberg etc. etc.

Tuli Kupferberg also provided the front cover cartoon (that gives it's name to the album title) - whenever I mention the sleeve I will invariably moan that Paul is right-handed in the cartoon - it still bothers me, and I know it shouldn't! There's a [Tuli documentary coming soon narrated by Thurston Moore](https://thetulimovie.com/).

This was the second copy to come into my posession and was given to me by Dean Wareham when I visited his flat in early 2001 - a story I've told many times, most recently in the post in this series about my [LP copy of Luna Live](/2023/06/01/my-record-collection-039-luna-live-lp/).

I've only just noticed that the LP has less tracks than my digitsed version - it seems that the CD version had five more tracks on it and someone must have sent a digitised version of the CD.
