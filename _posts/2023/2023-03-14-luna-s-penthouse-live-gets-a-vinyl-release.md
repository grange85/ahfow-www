In March last year Luna digitally released [Live Penthouse](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/live-penthouse), a recording of the band playing Penthouse through at The Chapel in San Francisco in 2017. Now, boutique vinyl label [Bandbox](https://bandboxrocks.com) has announced that the recording is to receive a deluxe double-vinyl issue. Due for release in July the label is now [taking pre-orders](https://bandboxrocks.com/products/luna-live-penthouse?).

The album will come in a "Seafoam Swirl" vinyl and have a gatefold sleeve and a sixteen page 'zine' with photos and an interview.

You can [pre-order the album from Bandbox](https://bandboxrocks.com/products/luna-live-penthouse) now for $44 plus postage.

If you can't run to that you can still [grab the digital version from Bandcamp](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/live-penthouse) for $7.
