Speedbumps was the last single released in the first phase of Luna. It was released on German label, Little Teddy Records at the tail end of 2004 in lovely translucent violet vinyl.

The single has the _Rendezvous_ versions of Speedbumps and Astronaut and contains the only physical outing of Luna's version of _Eyes in My Smoke_ (it did get released on the digital reissue of Rendezvous later). The sleeve suggests that the single has an A and a B side - the labels however suggest it has an A side and an AA side. As b-sides are a long established treat and since [double a-sides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-side_and_B-side#Double_A-side) are a marketing scam I'd say the sleeve is correct.

Eyes in My Smoke was later re-worked by Dean & Britta to accompany Ingrid Superstar's screen test in _13 Most Beautiful_.

Luna performed Speedbumps on John McEnroe's TV show on the 9th December 2004 with Matt Johnson sitting in for Lee Wall who was on the wrong side of the country at the time.
