In 2008 Japanese label Video Arts produced gorgeous CD versions of Galaxie 500's albums in little replica LP sleeves. Dean sent me a set, signed on the Obi strip. This is Today.

The CD came packaged in a lovely stiff card sleeve with an insert containing sleeve notes in Japanese, and the lyrics in Japanese and English. The disc has the word _sample_ stamped on its inner ring.
