I've been a bit neglectful of AHFoW over the last few months - maybe because there hasn't been a great deal happening in camp-AHFoW - or, more likely, I've been in a bit of an imagination slump. A few years ago I did a series of posts looking at the [original versions of all the songs covered by AHFoW-related bands](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/category/originals/) - obviously ... that's already a bit out of date so will need q revisit/update at some point - but ... not now. I also did a [flurry of posts about "Artefacts" in my collection](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/category/artefacts/) but that fizzled out - I might resurrect that at some point - but ... not now.

So, how to fill my time, and my blog!?

My record (and CD)  collection is pretty big, although (sadly) not as big as it once was - I downsized considerably before we moved. The Oxfam record shop (and a few other charity shops) in Ealing took literally hundreds of my LPs.

[My Discogs collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/grange85/collection) currently has 2381 entries - that doesn't include everything I still have, maybe about half?

The 'A Head Full of Wishes' folder in my Discogs collection (which probably does have _almost_ of all my AHFoW related releases) numbers 319

After filtering out the more ... _remote_ releases (e.g. guest appearances, production credits, etc.) I'm left with just over 200 - although, some are duplicates and I suspect some that have been filtered out maybe shouldn't have been!

So, I have taken all the releases by Galaxie 500, Damon & Naomi, Luna and Dean & Britta, sorted them randomly, and will try and post something about each of them.

To be honest, I'm not sure that all that many will have a story to tell, and even fewer will have an _interesting_ story - but ... I need to try and get myself back in the swing of things. So ... this is more for me than you - although please feed back. I know the blog has no comments but I can be found all over social media!
