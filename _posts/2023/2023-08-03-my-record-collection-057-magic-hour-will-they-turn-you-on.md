And this series continues to be Magic Hour top-heavy with their sixth appearance, and the second appearance of their second album, this time the CD that I bought on release.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/magic-hour-wttyoowttoy-cd.jpg" "Magic Hour - Will They Turn You On..." %}

The album was, according to the sleeve, _"Recorded Summer/Autumn 1994"_ however three of the tracks (including the epic _Passing Words_) had previously been recorded in May of that year for a Peel Session. You can hear the full [Peel Session here](/2013/10/04/audio-magic-hour-peel-session/) or if you prefer to hear some of it with Peelie's intro/outro, the first 90 minutes of the three hour show can be [listened to on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/peelshow1994/Peel+Show+1994-06-10+%28incomplete%29.mp3) and includes the first two tracks of the session.

I'm glad there are quite a lot of Peel shows _out there_ because it's great to listen to a show periodically to remind yourself that no one has come even close to what he was doing back then.

 - *Catalogue Number:* AHFOW 10/102
 - *Artist:* Magic Hour
 - *Title:* Will They Turn You On or Will They Turn on You
 - *Packaging:* Jewel case
 - *Format:* CD
 - The jewel case does have a sticker on the front but the text has long since faded to almost nothing so I can't make out where it was bought, or for how much.
 - [Buy 'Will They Turn You On or Will They Turn on You' on Bandcamp](https://magic-hour.bandcamp.com/album/will-they-turn-you-on-or-will-they-turn-on-you)
