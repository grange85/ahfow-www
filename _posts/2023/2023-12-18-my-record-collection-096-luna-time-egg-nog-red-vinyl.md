So, most of the posts in this series have been selected randomly, the exceptions are the _recent acquisitions_ posts which turn up when they come into my possession; and, because it would have seemed odd blogging about Christmas when it wasn't Christmas, I've scheduled some seasonal posts for during the festive season.

So... is Luna's Time / Egg Nog single a Christmas single?

<!--more-->

 - PRO: It was released around Christmas in 1992.
 - CON: It was a promo so wasn't in the shops, so you couldn't buy it as a pressie!
 - PRO: It was released in green and red vinyl editions - the two most Christmassy colours!
 - CON: _Time_ isn't really Christmassy at all - "the summer is now past" - so maybe an autumn song?
 - PRO: "Egg Nog" is a Christmas drink - not really so much in the UK though.
 - PRO: _Egg Nog_ makes abudant use of sleigh bells - the most Christmassy instrument!
 - CON: _Egg Nog_ is an instrumental so no Christmassy lyrics about bearded gents or sleigh rides or having a simply wonderful time!
 - CON: Luna have [played Egg Nog live](/database/tracks/egg-nog/#live) all year round.
 - PRO: The label has the words "Merry Christmas from Luna&#178;" written on it... on both sides!?
 - CON: _Egg Nog_ is the b-side.

Dean once described _Egg Nog_ as "one of the best things we ever put to tape", see what you think:

And here's Luna playing it... in September... without sleigh bells!
