White label (test pressing) of Dean & Britta's Quarantine Tapes LP. The A side label says "Dean & Britta - A - Quarantine Tapes" in Dean's handwriting - the B side label is signed by Dean & Britta. A gift (of course) and a prize possession!

Now it's been hard to put a positive spin on the shit-show that is the COVID pandemic, but... there was one - and it was Dean & Britta's live streamed shows. So the fact that there's a lovely vinyl record of them is an absolute treat. Maybe they should only have existed at a time they were so sorely needed... but damm! I'd love them to do more!
