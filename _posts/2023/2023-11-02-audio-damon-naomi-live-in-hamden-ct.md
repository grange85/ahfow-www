The always excellent [Doom & Gloom from The Tomb](https://doomandgloomfromthetomb.tumblr.com/) has just shared a beautiful recording of Damon & Naomi's concert at the Best Video Film & Cultural Center in Hamden, CT.

This was the closing show of a short run of East coast dates the duo performed last May:
