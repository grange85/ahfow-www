Lovely release on the always wonderful UK indie, Great Pop Supplement, released in 2010 it contains two tracks from Dean & Britta's 13 Most Beautiful remixed by Scott Hardkiss.

It came in a wrap around card sleeve with an extra couple of pages stapled inside with photos from a live performance of 13 Most Beautiful.

I bought this from Piccadilly Records (online). As it was a limited edition I bought it before I posted/tweeted about it... just in case a post on A Head Full of Wishes caused a surge in sales - I do occasionally have an inflated view of the power of AHFoW!

Despite the fact that I've titled this post "I'll Keep It With Mine" this is another double A side single. I'll try not to get annoyed every time one turns up but singles (almost&dagger;) always have an A and a B side no matter how hard the record company try to convince otherwise - the AA side is invariably a B-side! After all who would think that "Girl's School" by Wings was a Christmas number 1? No one - that's who!

It's as ridiculous as co-headlining tours - you go on last... you're headlining!

This version of I'll Keep It With Mine is the Scott Hardkiss remix that had Britta's vocal processed and was quite a talking point on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List at the time. I wasn't particularly keen:

> I think the issue isn't about autotune being used but more about autotune being OVERused - I've no idea if autotune is what's being used on Britta's vocal on the Scott Hardkis remixes but there is a processed - almost out of phase quality to them that I'm not keen on.

The discussion got so... lively... that [Britta kindly sent me some un-remixed versions](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2010/10/02/13-most-beautiful-the-missing-mixes/) to share. These had been on the original DVD release but hadn't made it on any of the CD versions of 13 Most Beautiful... or, onto this single.

> I'd be happy to send you all the DVD version without auto-tune. I'm kinda wishing we'd put it on the CD.

I must admit that my lack of enthusiasm for the remix has faded with time and I do rather love it now!
