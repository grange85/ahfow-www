Luna's second album Bewitched was first released in 1993 by Elektra and, unlike Lunapark _(Summershine)_ before, and all the subsequent albums _(Beggars Banqwuet/Teenbeat)_ until Romantica, never got licensed to any vinyl-loving indies for release in other territories and therefore, didn't get a vinyl release until this one in August 2012.

The album also reverted to the originally planned, but last-minute replaced, artwork - it's a little baffling that someone back in 1993 chose to replace this since it's a vast improvement.

This copy arrived shortly after release, sent to me and signed by, Dean. I actually have a surprising amount of signed records although I almost never have the nerve to ask to get things signed but appreciate that people sign things without being asked! Although the first thing I have that Dean signed for me was the back of ticket after a London show.
