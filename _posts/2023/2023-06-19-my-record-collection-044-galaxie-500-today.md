So... having [regained the rights to their recordings from Ryko]({% post_url /2023/2023-06-05-my-record-collection-040-today-on-fire-this-is-our-music %}) in 2009, ten years later we find Galaxie 500 starting a programme of releasing limited run _exclusive editions_ through Boston retailer Newbury Comics. This version of _Today_ was the third of these, released shortly before Christmas 2019 in maroon vinyl with a black "swirl" (not really a swirl, more of a smear).

Once upon a time coloured vinyl was the exception, and coming across one was more special because of that. But in the last couple of years very few records I've bought have been black. Now, I guess the record buyers must love that, or perhaps the record _sellers_ think it's what the record _buyers_ want, but I sort of miss the days when a coloured record was a surprise, or a treat.

Obviously I bought myself an orange On Fire, a blue (swirl/smear) This Is Our Music, and this one - maybe I'm just a sucker (no _maybe_ about it) ... but I justify it because the colour choices at least made sense - matching, or near-matching the album sleeve colours. I have resisted the latest pink On Fire and purple This Is Our Music ones. 

So at the end of 2019 this cost me $23.99 plus $14.99 postage - total $38.98  
A pink vinyl On Fire from the same retailer in 2023 would be $34.99 plus $15.99 postage - total $50.98  

A 30% increase in three years!

I am relieved that the first wave of reissues were black though.
