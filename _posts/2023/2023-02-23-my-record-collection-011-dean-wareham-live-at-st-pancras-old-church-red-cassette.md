Recorded across two nights as St Pancras Old Church in London and released on two different coloured cassettes by Sonic Cathedral - this is the red one. I might start getting embarrassed about how good the ex-members of Galaxie 500 are to me but this was given to me by Dean after his show at The Prince Albert in Brighton in May 2014.

BTW, I can't be sure but suspect that the download code in that photo has probably never been redeemed - so... if you're quick you can get yourself a free download of this fab little release!

There's a [video of the whole of one of those shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yttvsKGvGhw&list=PLgkLMlL-VFXsiKHn-ZsGdFpHHC26YkfbK) on YouTube.
