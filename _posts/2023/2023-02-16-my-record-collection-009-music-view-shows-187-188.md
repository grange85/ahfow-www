As far as I can glean from what's on the web, and what's on the disc Music View was a packaged radio show sent to college stations and show 187 featured Luna. I have no idea where I got this CD - I guess someone sent this to me, if it was you... thanks!

It dates from around the release of Bewitched, in fact Dean at one point describes Sean as being "almost in the band" - although he had toured and played on an album so maybe that's Dean teasing Sean.

It's a total of about 10 mins of Luna content which is mostly an interview with Dean and the album versions of This Time Around and Going Home. All the Luna content has been extracted and shared below for your enjoyment.
