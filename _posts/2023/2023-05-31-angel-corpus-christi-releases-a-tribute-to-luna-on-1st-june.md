The wonderful Angel Corpus Christi will be releasing "Bewitched: A Tribute to Luna" on 1st June on 12" vinyl (and I'll assume in all the usual digital/streamed locations). The album contains covers of six Luna tracks including her cover of I Want Everything that previously came out on a single in 2001.

Angel, of course, has some Luna/Dean Wareham form, as well as her previously mentioned cover of "I Want Everything"...

 - ACC dueted with Dean on [Je t'aime/I Wanna Boogie With You](https://angelcorpuschristi.bandcamp.com/track/i-want-to-boogie-with-you-je-taime) 
 - Dean & Britta played on ACC's [cover of Femme Fatale](https://angelcorpuschristi.bandcamp.com/track/femme-fatale)
 - Dean play guitar on [You](https://angelcorpuschristi.bandcamp.com/track/you)
 - Here's Dean [behind her on stage](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/pictures/angel-corpus-christi-dw-howardwpkn-insta.jpg)
 - And she's been [the sender of "strange faxes"](/2017/12/13/xmas-countdown-4-luna-bbc-radio-1-1995/) to Dean
 - _etc._

You should head to your fave indie store to grab a copy... or I guess keep an eye on [ACC's Bandcamp](https://angelcorpuschristi.bandcamp.com/) (and fill your boots while you're waiting).
