Naomi's new film _Never Be a Punching Bag For Nobody_ had been selected for the [Boston Independent Film Festival](https://iffboston.org/series/the-festival/). The festival runs from the 26th April until the 3rd May.

> A neighborhood Boston boxing gym out by Logan Airport is the last place you’d expect to find musician Naomi Yang, but that’s where she’s been spending her time, learning boxing and making a feature-length documentary, Never Be A Punching Bag for Nobody.
