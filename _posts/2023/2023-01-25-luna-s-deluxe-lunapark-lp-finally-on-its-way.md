Back in May of last year Run Out Groove records announced a deluxe double LP release of Luna's first album _Lunapark_, and started taking pre-orders. Yesterday Run Out Groove [posted on their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/RunOutGrooveLPs/posts/pfbid0Q5TcKoLjooX6DWoyDHkp7nZcohucnVsWjA8DxW7p5jtewwPW1uB7d2rsMBUfALWDl) that the release would finally start shipping out on the 10th February. 284 days after they started taking pre-orders.

It'll be nice to finaly get this, and it's been so long since I gave ROG (part of Warner Music Group) my money it'll feel a bit like it's free!

Now, I understand that there are delays with vinyl production and ROG [admit up front](https://www.runoutgroovevinyl.com/) that there's likely to be an "8 to 10 month" turnaround, but there's also a cost of living crisis and taking people's money _284 days_ before shipping is a pretty sad business practice IMO, and given that ROG is part of The Warner Music Group they didn't really _need_ our money for so long.
