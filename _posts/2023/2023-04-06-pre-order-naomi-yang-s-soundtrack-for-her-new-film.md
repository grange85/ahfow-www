The album marks Naomi's first solo release and today you can listen to the title track from the album [over on Bandcamp](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/never-be-a-punching-bag-for-nobody-original-soundtrack).

> I had been listening to a lot of instrumental music and instrumental soundtracks in the last few years and so it seemed very natural to try this myself.
