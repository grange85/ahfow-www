Dean & Britta have announced that the _Penthouse_ level patrons on [their Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/special-item-81485807) will be receiving a limited edition 7" EP of the music they made for the TV series Irma Vep.

> just a quick note -- for those who are subscribed at the "Penthouse" level, we have decided on the special gift for 2023, it will be a limited edition (200 copies) 4-track 7" vinyl EP containing French music we created for the Irma Vep TV show (which you have already heard here in mp3 format). We hope to mail these out by October. We'll keep you updated as the art is finalized

_Penthouse_ is the top tier of their Patreon at $9.50 a month and they posted in the comments that...

> you can upgrade now and get it -- the rule of thumb has been that if you're signed up at Penthouse level for 6 months then you'll get the gift. Also you get 20% off anything in the shop over at deanwareham.com.

So... head on over and support, or upgrade. Every month they post new music and Dean has been reading his autobiography which has been a joy - so well worth throwing some money at them if you can afford it!
