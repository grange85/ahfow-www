On this day 32 years ago Galaxie 500 played their last show. Two years ago I put out a fanzine commemorating the event. The fanzine was only 50 copies and sold out pretty quick so, if you missed out here's a PDF copy for your enjoyment.

Here's a mini _oral history_ of Galaxie 500's sad demise - [GALAXIE 500 have split (30 years on)](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2021/04/05/the-end-of-galaxie-500-30-years-on/)
