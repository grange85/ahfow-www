Last week while Damon & Naomi were in the UK for their first UK tour since 2019 I caught them for a [lovely afternoon show at Cafe Oto](/2023/09/06/damon-naomi-live-in-london/) - I loitered around afterwards for a few minutes to chat with Damon while Naomi worked the merch table.

I sidled over to chat to her once the queue had dwindled to the last couple of folk, [grabbed a selfie](https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/53168320329), thanked profusely, and left. It seems my hasty departure was perhaps a bit too hasty since later that evening I got a message from Naomi: "I brought a copy of the CDR of the soundtrack to give you and forgot to!"

I arrived back in Whitley Bay on Tuesday evening, on Wednesday morning an envelope landed on the doormat addressed in Naomi's beautiful and distinctive handwriting and inside was a card and a CDR.

'The soundtrack' was, of course, that of her recent, and very lovely film [Never Be a Punching Bag for Nobody](https://www.naomivision.com/never-be-a-punching-bag-for-nobody) presented in a brown card package, tied up with string (one of my favourite things). If you haven't yet you should probably [head over to Bandcamp](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/never-be-a-punching-bag-for-nobody-original-soundtrack) to check out the album, it is a gorgeous, spacious, entrancing, instrumental album, created to accompany the film, but one that works just fine as a stand-alone piece.

You can still [stream the film](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/punchingbag) for the price of a few cups of coffee&dagger; over on Vimeo, and I'd highly reccomend it.
