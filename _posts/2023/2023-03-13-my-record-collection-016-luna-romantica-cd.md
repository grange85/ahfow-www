This is my CD version of Romnatica - bought from Amazon on the 19th May 2003 for £11.99.

There are Luna sleeves I love and Luna sleeves I'm not so keen on... this falls into the latter, although not for obvious reasons. The problem I have is that the lighter, being a lighter, I guess, isn't rectangular - on the CD sleeve it's about 2mm wider at the top than the bottom. Now, in my head it _is_ rectangular, which means that whenever I look at the sleeve my brain keeps telling me that the lighter is... wonky. It looks... wrong, like a mistake has been made when I know it hasn't. It's ridiculous what 2mm can do to my brain!

Love the album though... but, [as already mentioned](/2023/01/30/my-record-collection-004-luna-romantica-lp/) not as much as most Luna albums.
