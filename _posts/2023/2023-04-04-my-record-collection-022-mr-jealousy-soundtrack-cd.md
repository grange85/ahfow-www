Luna feature quite heavily on the soundtrack album of Noah Baumbach's Mr. Jealousy. As well as the cover of John Lennon's _Jealous Guy_ there's the Penthouse version of _Chinatown_, the first outing of _Hello Little One_, a new version of which later appeared on The Days of Our Nights, and [Mr. Jealousy Luna Suite](/2015/03/31/audio-lost-tracks-mr-jealousy-luna-suite-by-luna/).

I watched the film in 2005, it was the first Noah Baumbach film I'd seen and I wasn't all that taken with it - although I rated it 7/10&dagger; which seems generous given what I wrote at the time:

> I wasn't convinced at all by Eric Stoltz - he didn't look at all
comfortable in the role and really seemed to be acting neurotic rather
than being neurotic (particularly in the therapy scenes) (and he had a
creepy smile). Annabella Sciorra did it so much better.
>  
> Nice to hear Luna music creeping in ocasionally - I had to rewind the
tape to see Dean's big part!
>  
> I'd rather have watched Annie Hall.
