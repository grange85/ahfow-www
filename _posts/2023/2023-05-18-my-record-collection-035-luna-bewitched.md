This is the CD of Luna's second album, Bewitched, that I bought on release back in 1994, obviously can't remember that far back to say where I bought it and for how much.

There was a discussion back in the day on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List about the photo on the back of the booklet. In it Dean is wearing a jacket very similar to the one Richard Lloyd is wearing on the sleeve of Television's Adventure and also that he is striking a pose pretty similar to Tom Verlaine's on the cover of that album too. Mike on the list asked Dean about this:

> I asked Dean about this similarity once, and while he denied that "striking the pose" was intentional, he did acknowledge that when he bought the red jacket (as seen in the Bewitched sleeve pic), he did note a resemblence to the red coat that one of the TV members is wearing on the cover of Television's "Adventure"
