This is the first of two copies of Britta's lovely _Love or Magic_ LP - this is the first one that arrived with a scratch at the beginning of side one - I complained... I don't always bother but... it was a pretty bad scratch. Britta sent me a new copy, and thankfully didn't expect the return of the old one so... I have two copies.

The price of all these big orders shipped from the US is rather making my eyes water - I paid $91 for a _Britta signed super bundle_ - which included a CD, an LP and a T-shirt... I think that was all. I was very tempted by the [Bang Bang lathe cut single](https://www.discogs.com/release/8507816-Britta-Phillips-Bang-Bang-My-Baby-Shot-Me-Down) but decided I couldn't justify the price for a one-track single (that being a lathe cut would possibly sound a bit underwhelming). Britta kindly shared a WAV of the song on Dean & Britta's patreon... which I'm sure sounded better! Still do kind of regret it though.

Actually I suspect it was the $91 that triggered me into complaining about the scratch!
