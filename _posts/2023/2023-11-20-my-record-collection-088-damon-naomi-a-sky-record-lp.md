Damon & Naomi's A Sky Record was an album that came out in drips - firstly as a [video of a live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOOhYuaGoXI) recorded at the Peabody Essex Museum on the 21st June 2021, then as a [booklet/download](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/merch/a-sky-record-deluxe-companion-book-and-digital-album) on the 6th August, next as a [CD (in Japan)](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/skyrecord) in May 2022, and finally [this LP](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/skyrecord) in July 2022.

The album was started before covid, started by Damon & Naomi in their home studio, and then taken to Japan for Michio Kurihara to do his bit. The lyrics were _post pandemic_ and can't help but be heard in that context, and because of that the album reflects a time more than most. 

> We started [it], like, 2018, or early 2019. We intended to finish it in 2020, so it started in the normal world (laughs). And then it just happened to be finished in the middle of this insane world we’re living in now, so it definitely was influenced by it.

Since _My record collection_ doesn't include books (or DVDs which is probably an oversight), I guess I'll mention here the lovely _A Sky Record Companion_ that was this albums first physical manifestation. In a different age this would have been an insert in the LP anyway... which is where I keep my copy.

The _companion_ is a lovely 48 page booklet, sewn together and contains a number of essays, lots of pictures, and the album's lyrics.

- Richard Youngs writes about touring with Damon & Naomi, and specifically the tour where Damon fell down the stairs and ended up in hospital.
- Damon writes about [Sky Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Records) and A Sky Record.
- Michio Kurihara writes about his contribution.
- Soichiro Nakamura of Peace Music writes aboout his studio and recording.
- A collection of lovely photos of Tsuruga, Japan by [Susanne Sasic](https://www.susannesasic.com/).
- Naomi writes about pandemic lyrics.
- [Lindsay Zoladz](https://lindsayzoladz.com/) writes about time... and "quarantime".
- [Jarvis Cocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Cocker) writes about [The Shipping Forecast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qfvv).

It's a good read but also a beautiful artefact and well worth [grabbing a copy](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/merch/a-sky-record-deluxe-companion-book-and-digital-album)!

BTW - here's the shipping forecast for where I live, in case you're interested:

> Tyne. Cyclonic 3 to 5, increasing 5 to 7 later, perhaps gale 8 later. Showers. Good, occasionally poor.
