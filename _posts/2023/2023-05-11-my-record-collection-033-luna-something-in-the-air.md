Luna's cover of Thunderclap Newman's _Something in the Air_ was released as part of lovely London indie _Sonic Cathedral's_ 2019 singles club. Luna's single was released in June... but this test pressing was sent to me by Nat of Sonic Cathedral with April's single.

I have plenty to write about the single but I'll save it for when the proper release comes along _(you won't have to wait too long for that)_.

In the meantime you might want to check what Sonic Cathedral are up to now - still releasing a relentless stream of amazing music - that's what! [Check them out](https://www.soniccathedral.co.uk/).
