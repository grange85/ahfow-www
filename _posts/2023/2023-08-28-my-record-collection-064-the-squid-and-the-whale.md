Dean & Britta provided the soundtrack for Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale... although the album has only two of their tracks, plus Dean's cover of Pink Floyd's 'Hey You'. I was expecting more!

In fact the one Lou Reed track is longer than all three of their contributions combined. Patrick on the Galaxie 500 mailing list felt that the promotion of the soundtrack treated the album as if it was "Noah's mix tape" - Britta replied ...

> Actually, it is mostly Noah's mixtape. Dean did pick The Feelies and Lou Reed, though.

There is more of their music in the film as Britta revealed on the list back in October 2005:

> We had 8 cues in the movie. The 2 main themes recur 3 times  (each time with a slightly different arrangement), and we did a version of one of the Bert Jansch songs (without vocals) as well as that version of "Love On A Real Train."

'Love on a Real Train' is a Tangerine Dream song originally used in 'Risky Business' - the quote above implies that it was Dean & Britta's version used in the The Squid and the Whale, but a web search suggested otherwise... so, I emailed Britta because I _needed_ to know, and because I would love to hear Dean & Britta covering Bert Jansch:

> ... we did a version of "Love on a Real Train." We titled it "Locker" since it played over that scene.
