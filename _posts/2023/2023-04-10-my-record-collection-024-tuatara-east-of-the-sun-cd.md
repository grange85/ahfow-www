When I first started the AHFoW discography I created some criteria about what should be included, although I sometimes strayed. Criteria #1 was that it had to have a direct relationship to a former member of Galaxie 500. That meant that I didn't include the side project that Luna's Justin Harwood was involved in 'Tuatara' - or at least didn't include it until _East of the Sun_, their fourth or fifth album, and a record with no input from Justin&dagger;. However, Dean Wareham does put in a vocal appearance on two tracks.

Tuatara seem to be a band that the world struggles to describe - Wikipedia call them an _instrumental music group_ which was I guess pretty much true up until this album. East of the Sun (and it's partner _West of the Moon_) are most definitley not _instrumental_ - inlcuding lots of guest vocalists of which Dean is one. I think the singers probably make Tuatara sound a little more ... conventional ... than those earlier albums. 

Other words that turn up in Tuatara reviews are _jazz_ and _fusion_ and _Americana_ and _soft rock_ and _soundtrack_ - but I suspect that just means that reviewers don't know where to file them.

They're def better than that Pitchfork review you might've come across suggests!

Here are Dean's contributions, Trouble Rides In and Your Ghost Town:
