Damon has a [piece in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/30/spotify-smaller-artists-wrapped-indie-musicians) on Spotify's recently announced changes to their royalty payments.

> For the rest of us, this is the quiet end to a number of loudly promoted ideas that would enable working- and middle-class creators to benefit from micropayments in the platform economy: the “long tail”, the “democratisation of content”, the “end to gatekeeping”. We’ve been hearing these slogans for decades, while watching our incomes from creative work go down and down, until finally now, for many of us on Spotify, they will hit absolute zero.

Spotify made £56m profit, but has decided not to pay smaller artists like me. We need you to make some noise
