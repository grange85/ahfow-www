Gotta Groove Records have pressed some more copies of Luna's second LP Bewitched. These can be ordered from [Dean Wareham's shop](https://deanwareham.com/product/893940) or direct from the [Gotta Groove store](https://www.gottagroovestore.com/product/luna-bewitched-ggr-exclusive/)

The album got it's first vinyl release as a limited edition in 2012, and was then re-pressed in 2021. I recently [blogged about this release](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2023/04/13/my-record-collection-025-luna-bewitched-lp/) in the [my record collection series of posts](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/category/my-record-collection/).
