Naomi Yang guests on the latest Free Association podcast, during the hour long chat with the host Brian Carpenter she talks mostly about her new film "Never Be a Punching Bag for Nobody", and the the recording of the soundtrack album, but also touches on touring, playing bass, and Neutral Milk Hotel's "Naomi".

> It was a bit shocking to Damon because I just wanted to plug my keyboard directly into my computer and just record the soundtrack that way and he was like "no beautiful microphones, no amplifiers. no me mixing it?" and I was like "nope".

It's well worth checking out in wherever you listen to podcasts... or here:
