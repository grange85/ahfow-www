Emancipated Hearts was released in the autumn of 2013 - it's a six track LP that was released as a lovely orange 10" by Sonic Cathedral (and in another colour - possibly black - on Double Feature) - the album was produced by Jason Quever (Papercuts) and featured 26 minutes of music... which gets me thinking about formats.

Now, I have always had opinions on formats - it's pretty simple

 1. A single... is 7" of vinyl, runs at 45rpm, and has 3 or 4 minutes of music on each side - normally one song/track per side...  
   _e.g. Galaxie 500 - Tugboat / King of Spain_
 2. A 12" (or occasionally 10") single... is 12" (or occasionally 10") of vinyl, runs at 45rpm, and runs a bit longer, and plays a bit louder, than a 7" single...
   _e.g. Galaxie 500 - Fourth of July / Here She Comes Now_
 3. An EP... is 7" of vinyl, runs at __45rpm__, and has 7 or 8 minutes of music on each side - normally two songs/tracks per side...  
   _e.g. The Beatles - Twist & Shout EP_
 4. An LP... is 10" __or__ 12" of vinyl, runs at 33rpm, and has 12 to 15 (10") or 15 to 25 (12") minutes on each side
   _e.g.
     - Galaxie 500 - On Fire (12")
     - _Dean Wareham - Emancipated Hearts_ (10")

 - A 12" EP... doesn't exist... it's a 12" single _see above_.
 - A _mini LP_ is an LP (_see above_) or a 12" (or 10") single (_see above_).

_everything else is an aberration!_

So, when Dean says:

> [M]y mini-LP or maxi-EP (__since it's 10" vinyl it is not an LP__) is out at last. 
  _Dean Wareham Newsletter - 15th October 2013_

... he's wrong - it runs at 33rpm and has 25'46" of music. OK, I'll grant that just under 26 minutes is at the short end of LP length - but it's not far off Dylan's Nashville Skyline (26'46"), Nick Drake's Pink Moon (28'22") - and out-runs The Beach Boys' Wild Honey (23'58") by a couple of minutes!

I should also point out that the catalogue number of this vinyl release is SCR047<strong>LP</strong>! 

So, Emancipated Hearts is an LP, and was Dean's first solo LP. I rest my case.

 - *Catalogue Number:* AHFOW 12/025
 - *Artist:* Dean Wareham
 - *Title:* Emancipated Hearts
 - *Notes:* orange vinyl
 - *Packaging:* card sleeve
