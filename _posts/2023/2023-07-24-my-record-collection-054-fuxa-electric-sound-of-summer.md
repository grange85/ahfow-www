F&uuml;xa's _Electric Sound of Summer_ was released in 2012 as a picture disc on top London indie [Rocket Girl Records](https://www.rocketgirl.co.uk/), and featured Dean Wareham's vocals on the cover of Suicides's Cheree and Britta Phillips singing on the cover of Daniel Johnson's Some Things Last a Long Time. Both are fine covers and the rest of the album is a treat.

F&uuml;xa is a project of Detroit-based musician Randall Nieman that has been putting out top notch space-rock for many years and Electric Sound of Summer is as fine an example of that as you could want. There's [stacks of great F&uuml;xa listening on their Bandcamp](https://fuxa1.bandcamp.com/music)!

Unusually for a picture disc (at least in my experience) the album also came in a cardboard sleeve although the opportunity to write detailed credits wasn't taken so I have no idea if Dean or Britta had any instrumental input on the album.

I'll have to admit that I'm not really a fan of Anthony Ausgang's art; psychedelic, stoned, cartoon cats aren't really my thing. Which is a shame because there'll be more of his art later. There'll also be plenty more cover art I don't like by other artists!
