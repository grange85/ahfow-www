As much as I adored the beautiful Galaxie 500 box set when it came out in 1996, it wasn't perfect. It did have a very glaring omission! The band had recorded two sessions for the John Peel show and these being missed from the collection made it only _almost_ perfect. It took until November 2005 for this vital gap to be filled! That was nine years of me whining about its absence!

Obviously recordings did exist - I had (ab)used my then employment to acquire a copy for myself, that then found its way into the ears of fans... but, it was a relief that the recordings finally got a legitimate release... although I still managed to be frustrated by the release! 

There were two Peel Sessions, the first recorded in October 1989, the second in October 1990 - but for some reason it was decided to put the second session on the CD first! That's just annoying. I'm not sure of the reasoning behind that but I suspect it was because the choice of songs on Peel Session #2 was a touch more inspired, and meant that the CD could open with the cover of The Sex Pistols' Submission? 

This copy was ordered from 20-20-20, so I could get the free poster that pre-orders got, and is still sealed.
