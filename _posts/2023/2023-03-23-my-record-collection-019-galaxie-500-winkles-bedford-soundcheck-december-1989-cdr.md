In July 2012 Lori emailed me "we found some pictures that we took at the Galaxie 500 ICA gig [...] also I've got an audio of the soundcheck they did at Winkles in Bedford" - sometimes brilliant things like this happen out of the blue... not as often as I'd like but maybe that makes it more special when it does?

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-winkles-1989-cdr.jpg" "CDR of Galaxie 500 soundcheck at Winkles in 1989" %}

The CDR duly arrived with short soundcheck snippets of "When Will You Come Home", "Pictures", "Flowers" and "Blue Thunder" and Lori's explanation:

> It was recorded by my mate. Although he recorded the soundcheck, he forgot to do the same for the gig!!

I posted [the ICA pictures a while back](/2012/07/19/photos-and-audio-galaxie-500-in-london-in-1989/), and here's Galaxie 500 soundchecking Blue Thunder in Bedford in 1989:
