To be honest I knew, back then, and know now, very little about Shapir-O'Rama. Dean Wareham appears on vocals on the final track on their first album _El mundo de vapor Valentia (old Vienna)_ which came out in 1994.

A bit of internet scouring to be honest hasn't revealed much... [this article on Trouser Press](https://trouserpress.com/reviews/when-people-were-shorter-and-lived-near-the-water/) suggests that the band exists becuase of a desire of Kim Rancourt (of When People Were Shorter and Lived Near The Water) had a "to work on original material with Dave Rick" and so is basically Dave Rick's earlier band Wonderama with Kim Rancourt.

I have this on LP, can't remember when I bought it - possibly early 2000s... certainly not in 1994 because this completely slipped me by at the time... and only when Kiek pointed out that I hadn't included it in my Dean Wareham discography did I then manage to hunt down a copy. I later had to scrounge a digital copy of the track so that I could share it.

Dave Rick guested on [Wax! Crackle! Pop! podcast #54](https://www.mixcloud.com/wax_crackle_pop/wax-crackle-pop-54-mystical-shit-from-the-noo-yawk-underground-with-dave-rick-and-chris-xefos/) and briefly touched upon Shapir-O'Rama.

Since the album doesn't appear to be on any streaming/download sites and since it's worth a listen I've ripped my LP and [popped it here](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/shapir-o-rama-el-mundo.zip) _(zipped mp3, 102MB)_ - if anyone is bothered by this please [give me a shout](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/about/)!
