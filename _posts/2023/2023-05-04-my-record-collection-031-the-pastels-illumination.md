Illumination was the second album by The Pastels that Dean guested on - the sleeve notes aren't kind enough to tell who appeared on what track so I guess you have to listen closely! For some reason I've shared _Rough Riders_ when I've written about this before - I must have known that from somewhere?

Illumination is a fantastic album that I don't listen to enough... maybe my favourie album by The Pastels (and not just because Dean's on it).


There's a cool interview with some of the main players from around the [20th anniversary of the album by French magazine Soul Kitchen](https://www.soul-kitchen.fr/75487-1997-2017-illumination-toile-de-maitre-pastels) (it is available in both French and English). I've pinched Dean's bit...

> **SK:** How did you meet The Pastels?  
> **Dean:** We met backstage at a Galaxie 500 show in Glasgow, must have been 1990, I think it was at the College of Printing and Building.  
> **SK:** How easy was your recording process of your guitar and your vocals?  
> **Dean:** I think I was in the studio just one day, or two days at most. Recording the guitars was quick, recording my backing vocal was harder.    
> **SK:** What’s your best memory of this recording process?  
> **Dean:** I remember it was sunny in Glasgow and I remember drinking Scotch with Katrina and Stephen.  
> **SK:** What’s your favorite song of this LP?  
> **Dean:** Probably “Viaduct” — so sad and pretty, seems like it’s a song about being in a band, I love the lyrics:  
_were we ever inspired / just for a moment / or is this our life? / slackness in the blackness....
can’t you see I’m trying to tell you? / We’ve paid our dues_

There's a lovely pic of all the album's collaborators which lived on Jonathan Kilgour's near-official website back in the day!
