Back in November, while browsing around I [came across the trailer for Never Be A Punching Bag For Nobody]() on Vimeo and assumed it was something that had slipped past me, and posted it on this website - today Naomi officially announced the film and shared the trailer, so I guess I rather jumped the gun with this one (sorry Naomi!).

There is now a [page on Naomivision](https://www.naomivision.com/never-be-a-punching-bag-for-nobody) with more information about the film and informing us that it will be _Coming soon in 2023_ - so... watch the trailer and sit tight for more details.

> The film weaves together three stories: colorful boxing coach and ex-drill sergeant Sal Bartolo Jr., son of a renowned 1940s East Boston boxing champ; Yang herself, learning boxing from trainer Bartolo and reexamining some of her own familyâ€™s disturbing history; and schoolteacher Mary Ellen Welch, who in the 1960s mobilized a group of neighborhood women against encroachment from Logan airport, fighting back against an indifferent city government.
