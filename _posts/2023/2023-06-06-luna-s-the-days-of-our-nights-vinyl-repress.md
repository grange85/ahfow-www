Luna's fifth studio album is getting a long overdue vinyl repress courtesy of Real Gone Music. I haven't seen too much in the way of announcements but this morning it has turned up in a number of UK online stores.

As far as I can tell:

- the _default_ release will be in an "orange swirl" vinyl.
- Rough Trade has a "powder blue" edition limited to 300 copies.
- I'd sort of be surprised if other indies get limited editions too. That seems to be the way.

The LP is due for release in August and is turning up for pre-order now...

 - [Rough Trade](https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/product/luna/the-days-of-our-nights-2) - limited edition 'powder blue' edition, or standard 'orange swirl',
 - [Norman Records](https://www.normanrecords.com/records/198086-luna-the-days-of-our-nights) - entry reads 'coloured vinyl' and 'limited edition' - suspect it'll be the orange one.

The album was originally released in 1999 by Beggars Banquet just as the band were dropped by Elektra which delayed its US release. Beggars released it in white vinyl and it also turned up on white vinyl in the Luna box set a couple of years back.

 The press release for the reissue reads...
 
 > Galaxie 500 co-founder Dean Wareham took his penchant for crafting sneakily hooky indie pop songs with gorgeously melodic, Television-esque guitar work into the '90s with his band Luna. The
group made four critically-acclaimed albums for Elektra…but in 1999, the label dropped them on the eve of releasing The Days of Our Nights, leaving them without American distribution (the album was eventually released on the short-lived Jericho imprint). As a result, The Days of Our Nights has been hard to find over the years; in fact, this marks the first time it’s been available as a stand-alone vinyl release in the U.S. But it really is a lost gem in their catalog; as Wareham says "Sometimes all you remember is the pain of making a record, or the events swirling around its release, and it’s only years later you come to appreciate the songs. The Days of Our Nights sounds like classic Luna, and we still play a handful of these songs in our live set."
> 
> Highlights include "Superfreaky Memories" (a hit for the band in Spain), "U.S. Out of My Pants!," "Hello Little One" (written for Noah Baumbach’s film Mr Jealousy), and a beautiful, Velvets-y cover of "Sweet Child O’ Mine" complete with a breathtaking solo by guitarist Sean Eden. Our Real Gone reissue features an orange swirl pressing housed inside a jacket and inner sleeve featuring lyrics. Highly recommended!
