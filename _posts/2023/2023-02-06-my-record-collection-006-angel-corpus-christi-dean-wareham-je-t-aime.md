Angel Corpus Christi and Dean Wareham cover Serge Gainsbourg and Lou Reed - what could be more perfect?

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/acc-dw-je-taime-spinning.jpg" "Angel Corpus Christi with Dean Wareham" %}

I did declare in the [introduction to this series](/2023/01/18/my-record-collection-introduction/) that I was being selective about what from my AHFoW collection would be included, but deciding what to include and what to leave out was becoming far too difficult - for instance, there was no way I'd be leaving out this absolute gem... but why include this and not, for example, Dean guesting on Ivy's Apartment Life, or Damon & Naomi's contributions to the Pearls Before Swine Constructive Melancholy compilation. So... everything is going in. Or at least everything that I know of! So my spreadsheet now has 347 rows and weekly posts would take me well into 2029! So... I'm trying to post more frequently!

So, back to _Je t'aime / I Wanna Boogie With You_ ... I didn't buy this at the time of release (1997), but had an mp3 that Angel had put on her "official, unauthorized web site". I then got it on CD when it was released on ACC's Louis Louis LP. 

I eventually picked this picked this up for a tenner on Discogs in 2016, except annoyingly, without the postcard - it was described in the listing as...

> Unplayed vgc pink vinyl in pvc sleeve. No postcard. No sticker. Unplayed one off. From pressing plant at time - Hence no packaging. Low price for rare 7".

I'm not sure a tenner was a _low price for a rare 7"_ (Discogs says the average is £9) but it was the only copy at the time that was shipping from the UK and so had reasonable postage costs. And I so wanted a copy. 

The track was also released on a Munster 7" which I don't own... yet!

The flip has Angel covering Suicide's Cheree, with Alan Vega, and The Beach Boys' Surfer Girl.

Angel can still be found around these parts... [ACC web site](https://www.angelcorpuschristi.com/), [ACC Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/angelcorpuschristi/), [ACC Bandcamp](https://angelcorpuschristi.bandcamp.com/)
