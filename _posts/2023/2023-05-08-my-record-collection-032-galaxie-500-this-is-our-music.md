By the time This Is Our Music was released I was a full on _fan_ of Galaxie 500 and this is the copy that I bought, probably on release day, certainly in the first week of release, in early October of 1990. I can't remember where but probably in one of the big chains since it's not the _Chain With No Name_ special edition... so maybe not as big a fan as I though!?

I still struggle with the commonly held belief that This Is Our Music is somehow sub-par Galaxie 500 - I think it's become one of those ideas that people latch onto without really considering it... almost an urban myth. But damn! It's such a good album. I thought that at the time and my love of it hasn't diminished at all over the years, if anything it has grown. Even the protaganists play it down... _"it could have been twice as good"_ said Kramer; _"half of it is good"_ said Dean... I don't think they're hearing it like I do - I think they're hearing the _making_ of it.

So, this CD has seen a lot of laser-time in the almost 33 years of its life.
