The Chain With No Name was a collection of independent record stores that was set up in the late 1980s to try and loosen the grip of the big chains with names like HMV, Virgin and Our Price. This was mostly done by arranging limited editions from indie record labels. This copy of This Is Our Music came with two postcards which, I have to say, is not a particularly high-grade inducement.

Since I've already posted about my first copy of This Is Our Music this is one that came into my possession later, but still has the (opened and aging) shrink wrap with the CWNN sticker and with both postcards. One is a reproduction of the blue section from the front of the album sleeve and the other is the distorted pic from the back - nice to have but... like I said... not a high-grade inducement if getting to your nearest indie involved public transport costs.

Here's [one of the postcards that Dean sent to Justin in November 1990](https://www.instagram.com/p/CF0XFtGFnDu/) before he visited NZ for a holiday.

> 11-18-90
>
> Justin !
> 
> I'm coming to your house.  
> I'm drinking your coffee.  
> I'm using your towels.  
> Right now I'm in France travelling on the fastest train in the world.  
> It's all going well but

... and that is where the image is cropped... given the imminent demise of Galaxie 500 that _but_ says SO MUCH! 

Dean comments that the rest of the sentence is _"I really don't know"_ - which also says a lot - but somehow that _but_ without a full stop is a little more heartbreaking!
