There's a nice interview with Dean Wareham over at Clash. Dean was interviewed while he was in London and talks at length about Galaxie 500 and playing shows of Galaxie 500 songs - _"It’s funny, I used to think these songs were all really quiet. But when I went back and revisited them, re-learned them… some of ‘em aren’t quiet at all! I’m really wailing it out."_

He also touches on his last solo album _"The thing that made that record happen is that I put down on a deposit on a studio and said: yes, I’m gonna be there! That’s the kick in the pants I needed"_, and Luna although puzzling mentions a 30th anniversary next year of a Luna album that had it's 30th anniversary last year?
