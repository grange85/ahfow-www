So Magic Hour put in their third appearance in six posts - and with the two compilation albums I've posted earlier it means that a surprising 10% of the first 50 posts are about them.

This is a black vinyl&dagger; copy of Magic Hour's first album that I bought on Discogs in 2012 for a bargain €5.55 (plus postage) - [the CD](/2023/06/26/my-record-collection-046-magic-hour-no-excess-is-absurd/) was my first copy and the one that was my only copy for a good few years.

 _&dagger; - the fact that I mention **black vinyl** suggests there's another copy on the way - maybe I'll have come up with something more insightful to write when it arrives!_
