This is a cassette sent to me in the mid 90s by someone from The Galaxie 500 Mailing List in, I'd guess, 1995 since it has some of the tracks that later turned up on the box set... as well as some stuff that didn't. I can't remember who sent this, possibly Matthew (who was very helpful in the early days of the list/website but who I've long lost touch with).

The tape is not great sounding - there seems to be some audio leak through, but, if you want to listen to the whole thing I've [zipped it up and popped it on Mediafire to download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ff00g6kl9iz016u/galaxie-500-unreleased-sessions-and-live-at-the-rat-mc.zip/file).

 - *Catalogue Number:* AHFOW 16/010
 - *Artist:* Galaxie 500
 - *Title:* Unreleased sessions and live at The Rat
 - *Notes:* 
 - *Packaging:* cassette box and handwritten insert
 - *Format:* MC

 _My tape deck died a couple of years back so this has been dubbed with a crappy portable which I suspect is contributing to the poor sound - although the bar was set pretty low._
