Well I know exactly how much I paid for Guitarrorists because it still has a sizeable _SALE £3.99_ sticker on the front. I also know that I bought it from an HMV since the sticker on the back is kind enough to tell me that. Not sure which HMV but suspect it was one of the West End ones since I can't imagine the Ealing Broadway branch having it... although, I have been surprised in there so wouldn't completely rule it out.

£3.99 is a bargain for...

> A compilation of 26 instrumental tracks from the guitar players for  
> SONIC YOUTH  
> DINOSAUR JR.
> BIG BLACK  
> GALAXIE 500  
> SPACEMEN 3  
> BUTTHOLE SURFERS  
> and 20 others

... but not _that much_ of a bargain, I don't listen to it that often. And given that my motivation for buying it was for the Dean Wareham track "West Broadway" and given that that checks in at just 2'42" ... maybe £3.99 is probably as much as I ought to have paid?
