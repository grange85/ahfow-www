Dean doesn't often venture into production - this was an early outing, I think it was recorded at the same time as Pee Shy's _Who Let All The Monkeys Out_ album (which will turn up later in this series) and released before the album on Tampa, FL indie Screw Music Forever - [although they weirdly don't seem to admit it on their (admittedly rather broken) web site](http://www.screwmusicforever.com/).

The single was:

 - recorded in 1995 - as was Luna's Penthouse
 - engineered by Mario Salvati - as was Luna's Penthouse
 - recorded at Sorcerer Sound in NYC - as was Luna's Penthouse
 - and, obv, involved Dean Wareham... as did Luna's Penthouse

The single is a little less polished than the album, Yellow Race Car is a cool bit of noisy mid-90s guitar rock. The b-side is a gentler, piano-driven affair. Both tracks are well worth a listen and since I can't find this online to link to, here are recordings from my single.

Now I have vague memories about Dean mentioning this production job in an interview, but haven't tracked that down and probably shouldn't guess at what I think he might have said.

I only got my paws on a copy of this in 2017 for a fiver on Discogs. I had the album from not long after it's release in 1996.
