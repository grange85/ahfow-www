Damon & Naomi had covered Ghost's "Awake in a Muddle" on their third album _Playback Singers_ and had performed live with them before this full album collaboration came about, so it wasn't a surprise when in April 2000 news leaked out that they had been recording together at their home studio.

> WE FIRST MET the Japanese band Ghost in 1995; despite any language barriers, we understood one another immediately and soon became friends. We have since toured together in both the U.S. and Japan, and on occasion Ghost has joined us on stage to play our songs. After a show like this in Tokyo in the fall of 1998, we decided to record an album together. Over the course of the following year, we sent our new songs to Japan, and Ghost sent back ideas for production and arrangements. They also sent music for a new song of theirs, to which we added lyrics. Then, in the last days of 1999 and the first of 2000, Ghost came to our studio to record this album, and celebrate the New Year, together.

Damon & Naomi with Ghost sleeve notes.

The album was released on CD by Sub Pop in a sweet tri-fold digipack that showed off Naomi's design and photos - this is probably my favourite Damon & Naomi sleeve and the one I'd rip-off when I made [sleeves for my bootlegs](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2021/05/14/audio-full-show-damon-and-naomi-london-2001/).

It's also probably my favourite Damon & Naomi album, although that's a list that changes often. It always frustrated me somewhat that More Sad Hits would routinely get almost all the votes in the annual survey, I suspect mostly because it was the only album that lots of folk had. Not that MSH isn't a great album, but I couldn't help feeling that if more people listened to With Ghost more people would love it.

Back then Sub Pop produced a little With Ghost microsite - it annoyed the archivist in me that when a new album came along the old website was thrown out and replaced. Thnakfully the [Wayback Machine is, as it so often is, our friend](http://web.archive.org/web/20001007144954/http://www.subpop.com/bands/damon+naomi/withghost/home.html), so we can go back and see what the web looked like for D&N back then... and what treats were in store:

 - Four desktop wallpapers in GIF format, available in either 800x600 or 1024x768

 - A [Damon & Naomi "e-card"](https://youtu.be/Knz8vpsNRkU) - which I've preserved for posterity over on YouTube
 - A download of The Mirror Phase - either zipped for Windows users, or Stuffit-ed for Mac.
 - It also had the text of Byron Coley's excellent [Six Methods of Approaching Damon & Naomi with Ghost](http://web.archive.org/web/20001007144652/http://www.subpop.com/bands/damon+naomi/withghost/chapter1.html) - a physical copy of which will turn up later in this series.
 - A selection of RealAudio samples from Damon & Naomi's previous albums

 No idea where I bought this - but it would have been pretty close to release day!
