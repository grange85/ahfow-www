Along The Santa Fe Trail was a _cowboy song_ that Dean Wareham and Cheval Sombre recorded that didn't make it onto the wonderful [Dean Wareham vs Cheval Sombre LP](/database/dean-and-britta/dean-wareham-releases/dean-wareham-vs-cheval-sombre/) but was available on this lathe-cut single that was part of a special edition of the album released through Dean's website.

The single is clear, square, and came in a heavy PVC sleeve with artowrk printed on another clear piece of plastic. Apparently the 300 singles cost more than all the LPs (and their sleeves) to manufacture.

> "Along the Santa Fe Trail" was recorded during the Dean Vs. Cheval Sombre sessions and released as a lathe-cut 7" single. Vocals by Chris & Dean, with Gryphon Rue on the singing saw and Anthony LaMarca on lap steel guitar. The song was written for the 1940 film "Santa Fe Trail" starring Errol Flynn, Olivia De Havilland and Ronald Reagan!
