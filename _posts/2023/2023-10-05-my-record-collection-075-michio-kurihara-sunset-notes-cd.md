In 2005 Damon & Naomi started their own record label 20\|20\|20 which they used in 2007 to release Michio Kurihara's 2005 album Sunset Notes that had previously been released in Japan.

Kurihara had already long been a collaborator with Damon & Naomi, having first appeared on their album [With Ghost]() and having toured with them extensively. Damon & Naomi had been involved in the original Japanese release so it was only natural that they should try and get the album a wider audience.

It is an album mostly made up of guitar led, instrumental pieces (although they all have _lyrics_ in the sleeve notes) - the exceptions being the two gorgeously fragile tracks that are blessed with gentle, whispery vocals by [Ai Aso]() - Wind Waltzes and  The Wind's Twelve Quarters.

The first 100 copies came with a limited edition guitar pick. I got one. This was the second souvenir guitar pick I had - the first was plucked out of the air when Lemmy threw it into the audience at the end of a Mot&ouml;rhead show at The Marquee in 1983 ... I kept it in my wallet and prodly showed it to anyone who cared... and then one day it wasn't there any more. I've had so many wallets since then but I keep thinking I might find it again in one of them.
