The always great NYC Taper has just [posted a fine recording of Damon & Naomi's recent show](https://www.nyctaper.com/2023/05/damon-naomi-may-9-2023-tubbys-kingston-ny/) at Tubby's in Kingston, NY.

> Tubby’s is a small room and acoustic sets full of ballads can be complicated. On this Wednesday night, the crowd was completely engaged in the moment. We stood enthralled as they worked through songs from their most recent album, 2021’s, “A Sky Record” and beyond. Things got really interesting when they invited their co-headliners, Meg Baird and Charlie Saufley, to join them. 

[Head over to NYC Taper to grab the whole show](https://www.nyctaper.com/2023/05/damon-naomi-may-9-2023-tubbys-kingston-ny/) in either flac or mp3 - you can also [stream the show on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/mr_kliked/sets/damon-naomi-2023-05-09tubbys)

I've also come across this [nice set of pics by Irene Trudel](https://www.flickr.com/photos/irene_trudel/albums/72177720308207147) from the following night at Union Pool in Brooklyn.
