This 7" was given away with limited copies of the Galaxie 500 DVD _Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste_ in 2004 and features two live tracks lifted from the video of the show at Club Lingerie that was included on the DVD.

Weirdly this is actually difficult to listen to and that's because poor Dean's throat was clearly not fit for the show - Snowstorm is quite early in the set so isn't too bad, but by the time we get to Pictures it's hard not to wince every time he reaches for a note his throat can't manage. But what a trooper!

Snowstorm is my favourite Galaxie 500 song, no question. For most bands, the song of theirs I love most varies with my mood, but with Galaxie 500 it's always Snowstorm - [I've speculated before why that might be](/2019/10/05/on-fire-30-side-1-track-3-snowstorm/).

The sleeve contains two shots from Macioce's first photoshoot with Galaxie 500:

> Macioce: The first time we did a photo shoot, we went to a park in Queens. I had them walk into the trees; I was thinking of an ELP record, Trilogy I used color infrared film for a '60s psychedelic feel. After the film came back we met up at Noise New York on Walker Street. We were in the studio when I showed them the pictures. They were so polite, very respectful of us, being a bit older, and I think they were not crazy about the shots.

> Kramer said, "Look at them! You look like Ten Years After!" And Galaxie stared back blankly. "Ten Years After!" Kramer said again. I looked from face to face. "Ten Years After? Woodstock?" That may have been the first time I realized I was now older than the bands I photographed. They didn't use the picture for an album, but Kramer made a shirt from it.

I think that is one of my favourite quotes in the book ...

... also I think [that photoshoot](https://www.instagram.com/p/CZSJzHFFMkQ/) is my favourite of Galaxie 500! That and the [Unisphere one](https://www.instagram.com/p/CeECYKFOrfW/?img_index=1).

A few years back Naomi sent me one of the T-shirts Macioce mentioned and said "you should just have fun with it and wear it even if it self-destructs" but I [put it on once for a photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/53137337736/in/album-72157619400404262/) and then filed it - I've been saving it for a special occasion - I'm not convinced any occasion will be special enough though!
