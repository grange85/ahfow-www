Luna's cover of Thunderclap Newman's _Something in the Air_ was released as part of Sonic Cathedral's singles club in 2019, I [wrote about the test pressing]({% post_url /2023/2023-05-11-my-record-collection-033-luna-something-in-the-air %}) that Nat sent me earlier and suggested I had "plenty to write about the single" that would wait for this post... not sure whether the post will live up to that tease... but here goes.

Some random _facts_ related to this single coming... as they pop into my head:

 - Something in the Air was written by Speedy Keen who was born, and lived in Hanwell, a few hundred yards from where I lived, for a long time... although not sure if he lived there while I did. I never, knowingly, bumped into him. There is no blue plaque to him - I think there ought to be. He also produced Motorhead's first album.
 - Subscribers to the Sonic Cathedral Singles Club got extra gifts with each release - Luna's came with a very cool [NASA-like _mission_ patch](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2019/06/04/sonic-cathedral-luna-mission-patch/).
 - For a short period I built and ran (for free) the website for a version of Thunderclap Newman - only Andy Newman was still a part of the band, I met him at a gig they played in a bar in West London and he was lovely. The gig wasn't great and [I wrote as much](https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2007/07/02/thunderclap-newman-and-andy-thunderclap-newman/) on my blog... which saw me sacked from my role as Webmaster. I got a slightly ridiculous formal dismissal via a letter.
 - The flip side of the single contained _The Oort Cloud_/_Kuiper Belt_ - two spacey, instrumental improvisations.
 - Another member of Thunderclap Newman was Jimmy McCulloch who was later in Wings... and died too young.
 - For the launch of the single Sonic Cathedral had a splendid, but sadly sparsely attended, evening at The Social. It included a screening of _Tell Me Do You Miss Me_ some excellent live performances by _"surprise live bands"_ ([Daniel Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvXVcXdibFo), [Buffalo Postcard and Ben Phillipson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZZYddaDo2o)) and _"special guest DJs"_ ... which was me!
 - Here's the playlist of a [mix of what I played during that DJ-ing job](/articles/sonic-cathedral-social-service-playlist/) - I've not been asked again!
