This was the first single by Dean Wareham's side project with his then wife Claudia, Cagney and Lacee. The sticker on the sleeve shows that I paid £3.50 for this at the Talbot Road Rough Trade Shop (now Rough Trade West) - the phone number on the sticker shows that it was before 2000.

The sleeve doesn't actually say the artist name which explains the addition of a large, round black sticker that was attached reading __Cagney & Lacee__ and underneath in smaller letters _this sticker is removable_ - this suggests (to me) that the missing artist name was either an oversight or latterly considered a mistake. It doesn't however mention anywhere that "Cagney" was actually Dean Wareham of Luna and Galaxie 500.

Since the sticker was removeable, and obscuring most of Donald Duck's face, I carefully removed it and attached it to the inside of the sleeve.

_Update (2023-04-13): Thanks to Bobby ([@enablerno6 on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/enablerno6/) for pointing out that the sticker, and it's location, obscuring Donald Duck's face, was a ploy to avoid potential Disney litigation!_

The single was released on Terry Tolkin's No. 6 Records in 1995 and has the tracks [Time (written by Michael Merchant) and previously recorded by everyone](/2014/07/09/originals-time-nancy-sinatra-covered-cagney-lacee/) and [By The Way (I Still Love You) written by Lee Hazlewood and originally recorded by Nancy Sinatra](/2013/03/27/originals-by-the-way-i-still-love-you-by-nancy-sinatra-covered-by-cagney-and-lacee/).
