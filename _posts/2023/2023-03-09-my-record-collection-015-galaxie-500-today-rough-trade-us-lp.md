Slightly shocking that we've had to wait until the 15th entry in the series before Galaxie 500 put in an appearance - to be honest given how many copies of Today I have it's a surprise it has taken this long to reach a copy of Today! For a long time I was happy with the LP I bought of the album in 1990, and then the CD that came in the box set. But at some point it got out of hand.

This is the Rough Trade US re-release of Galaxie 500's debut album, released in 1991. I bought this in June 2012 but haven't managed to figure out from where, or how much I paid - it's a bit grubby so... hopefully not too much! 

The run out grooves have the Aurora catalogue number etched into them... and then crossed out!
