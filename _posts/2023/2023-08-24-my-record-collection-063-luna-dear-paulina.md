Luna's Dear Paulina single was released in September 1999 and is one of the few physical achievements of A Head Full of Wishes.

Here are some facts - some of which are repeated from the post linked below, and some might be new:

<!--more-->

- It is the only release (so far) on GRANGE85RECORDS - so named because at the time I lived at **85** Studley **Grange** Road - I don't live there any more... so, don't write to me there.
- The run out groove has the URL **www.aald.demon.co.uk/galaxie/** inscribed in there - the domain doesn't exist any more... so, don't bother visiting it... except in the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/19990129013042/http://www.aald.demon.co.uk/galaxie/).
- The insert included the URL above and an email address that also no longer exists.
- The picture on the sleeve is of Hazel, taken by my friend Martin.
- The single is probably technically a _bootleg_ since I don't think Dean should have given it to me since it _belonged_ to the makers of [the film that it was used in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_(film)). Although he was quite confident that a small run on a UK indie wouldn't come to their attention.
- In the film, "Dallas", played by Paulina Porizkova, chooses to play 'Dear Paulina' while torturing/raping "Casey" - she plays a CD of it.
- The track has never been released on CD.
- Dear Paulina eventually turned up on the _Rarities_ LP as part of the [Long Players 92-99](/database/luna/releases/long-players-92-99/) box set - although, disappointingly, the sleeve wasn't included in the "a collection of singles and EPs" picture in the booklet.
- The British Library has a copy of the single - here is [the BL catalogue entry](http://sami.bl.uk/uhtbin/cgisirsi/?ps=jElcXecYRH/WORKS-FILE/137550011/9).

Remember banner ads - not that it was an ad, I didn't pay for it to be placed anywhere:

_I've actually already written far too much about the single, mostly in [this post](/2009/07/11/mp3-lost-tracks-6-luna-dear-paulina/) so if you want the full story of how Dear Paulina came about probably best head over there - you'll be able to nab mp3s of both sides of the single there too._
