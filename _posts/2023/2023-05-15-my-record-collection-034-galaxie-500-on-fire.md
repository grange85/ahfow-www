So we finally come to the first appearance of Galaxie 500's masterpiece, this is the UK Rough Trade LP released in late 1989. 

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-on-fire-rough-trade-uk.jpg" "Galaxie 500 - On Fire (Rough Trade UK)" %}

On Fire was my first exposure to Galaxie 500 and was my first purchase... but not this version - 1989 was the middle of my transition from vinyl to CD, so the first Galaxie 500 release I bought was On Fire on CD, the second was Today on vinyl. I'm now slightly annoyed at my inconsistency. I bought [This Is Our Music on CD]({% post_url /2023/2023-05-08-my-record-collection-032-galaxie-500-this-is-our-music %}), but bought it as a birthday present for a friend on vinyl.

Also slightly annoyed that I so fully jumped on the CD bandwagon... it did get to the point where the consumer had no choice and I'd have had to, but no I was an early and complete adopter, just the sort of sucker the labels loved. I probably still am.
