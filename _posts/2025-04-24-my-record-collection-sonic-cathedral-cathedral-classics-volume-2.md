This is the second volume promo compilation released by Sonic Cathedral released in 2013 which contains Dean Wareham's cover of Cheval Sombre's {% ahfowtrack "She Went Walking in the Rain" %} that had previously been the b-side of the Love is Colder Than Death single.

The first volume of Cathedral Classics had Dean & Britta's White Horses on it, I thought I had a copy of that as well but it seems not. I think this was slipped into a package sent to me by Nat of Sonic Cathedral back when it was released. As well as Dean's track the compilation has lots more of the great stuff that Sonic Cathedral always puts out - there's a Sonic Boom remix of a Yeti Lane track, a Cheval Sombre rarity, The Early Years, Lorelle Meets The Obsolete... etc.

On the post about the [Love is Colder Than Death single](/2024/08/08/my-record-collection-160-dean-wareham-love-is-colder-than-death-she-went-walking-in-the-rain/) I suggested that the single was the only physical release with _She Went Walking in the Rain_ but clearly I'd forgotten that it had appeared on this promo CD.
