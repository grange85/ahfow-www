Magic Hour's second release, just ahead of their first album, came out on Ch√© Records in 1994 and contained, on the a-side the album track After Tomorrow and another Magic Hour original World of One. On the b-side a fifteen minute version of Permanent Green Light, originally released by NY psych-rock band The Godz on their second album.

I managed to miss out on Permanent Green Light on my [originals series](/category/originals/) a few years back, mostly I imagine because it didn't state on the sleeve that it was a cover and I was unfailiar with The Godz. It did mention that it was written by _Jim McCarthy_ on the label so I ought to have picked up on it, but suspect that I just hadn't pulled it out of the sleeve enough to notice.

In 2016 Magic Hour released a digital only compilation of non-album tracks which is where I was alerted to the omission as the Bandcamp page clearly stated "'Permanent Green Light by the Godz'". The Godz original was just four minutes long but I could imagine it being stretched live, and Magic Hour's version is exactly how I'd imagine it to sound if it were, Lots of noise, lots of feedback, and a motorik relentlessness. 

Here's 

The randomness of my method of selection has been particularly odd with Magic Hour who turned up seven times in the first 100 posts and only twice in the almost 200 since then, and this is the first Magic Hour entry since in eighteen months - and there are (currently) only two more after this one.
