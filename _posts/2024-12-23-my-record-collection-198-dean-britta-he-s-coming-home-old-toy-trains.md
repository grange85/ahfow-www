This is a black vinyl copy of Dean & Britta's lovely Christmas single put out by Chimney Rocks! back in 2007. I wrote about an un-numbered [blue vinyl copy](/2023/12/21/my-record-collection-097-old-toy-trains-hes-coming-home/) last Christmas. This one however has a number 480/500.

Both of these tracks have recently reappeared on [A Peace of Us](https://deanandbritta.bandcamp.com/album/a-peace-of-us) the fab Xmas album from Dean & Britta and Sonic Boom.
