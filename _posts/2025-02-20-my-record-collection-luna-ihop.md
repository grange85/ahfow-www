IHOP was (I think) the second single from Pup Tent after Bobby Peru...  unless they were released the other way round. I can't remember and can't prove it. It's probably the way I'd have released them since I like Bobby Peru better...

... although, maybe because I've seen Wild at Heart (even if I can't remember it at all), and have never been to an International House of Pancakes, Joakim and Ulrika have though... of course, and _acquired_ IHOP mugs into the bargain!

<blockquote>
The waitress looked over her shoulder making sure no one else was close. She leaned over the table and lowered her voice. "Go ahead just take them", she said with a funny smile. She quickly went away to pick up another order of pancakes. We got IHOP mugs for free, at International House of Pancakes. We left, full of pancakes, happy and free.

Of course, the reason I have never eaten in an IHOP is that despite the **I** they are not really international and seem to be concentrated in the Americas, the Middle East and Asia - there are a few pancake restaurants over here e.g. My Old Dutch - which has the [most London name possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvyZDgxVx8) and in Whitley Bay _CrÃªperie Nathalie_ which has a fancier name.

I have never worked out what the heck the sleeve is a photo of, it's by [David Levinthal](https://davidlevinthal.com/) who took all the cowboy photos used across Pup Tent and its related releases - so I guess it's a detail from one of those? It's probably [here somewhere](https://davidlevinthal.com/artwork/ww-87-89.html) but I haven't found it. Any help appreciated!

The b-side of the single includes the first outing for _Words Without Wrinkles_ this version has a sweet little intro that was dropped when the song was re-recorded for The Days of Our Nights.

"sourceurl": "/database/luna/releases/singles/#ihopbbq313cd",
"sourcecap": "IHOP single"
} %}

I think I prefer this version, although maybe that's just because of my knee-jerk Days antipathy!?

Also included was the album version of Fuzzy Wuzzy... and I also prefer the longer [demo version of that](/2015/07/14/audio-lost-tracks-fuzzy-wuzzy-demo-by-luna/)!

Beggars Banquet also released IHOP as a 7" single (without Fuzzy Wuzzy), but I don't own that (yet) so this is it for IHOP.
