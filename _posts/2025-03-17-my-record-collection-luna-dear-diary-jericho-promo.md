This is a one track promo of Dear Diary put out by Luna's (then) new record company Jericho ahead of their release of [The Days of Our Nights](/2023/10/26/my-record-collection-081-luna-the-days-of-our-nights-jericho-cd/)

So, having been dumped by Elektra on the eve of the release of Days... Luna, shopped the LP around and finally settled with Jericho - this one track radio promo comes in a jewel case with a full colour sleeve - the back resembles the back of the album, but has a picture of the front cover where the barcode should be.

The front cover has a inverted picture of someone, I don't know who. On the reverse is a bit of Luna puff:

<blockquote>
<p>
    Time Out London said "LUNA makes some of the finest guitar music to come out of America this decade," and the New York Post claimed that "few rock bands work up a guitar sound as elegant and moving." In May 1999 Rolling Stone singled out LUNA's 1995 release Penthouse as one of the "150 Essential Recordings of the '90s."
</p>

<p>
    Luna-Dean Wareham, Justin Harwood, Sean Eden and Lee Wall - make their JERICHO RECORDS album debut with THE DAYS OF OUR NIGHTS. the follow-up to the critically acclaimed Pup Tent.
</p>

<p>
    Swirling with Luna's signature lush arrangements, haunting melodies, masterful guitar work and sharp lyrics, THE DAYS OF OUR NIGHTS is infused with a newfound sense of excitement and grandeur and is the first album to capture the rich intensity of the band's powerful live performance.
</p>

<p>
    As one of the most celebrated bands in alt, rock, LUNA packs clubs the world over with a loyal fan base that includes Beck and R.E.M. (Between albums, bassist Justin Harwood moonlights with Tuatara. a jazz/worldbeat side project with Peter Buck of R.E.M. And Barrett Martin of the Screaming Trees.)
</p>

<p>
    THE DAYS OF OUR NIGHTS was produced by Paul Kimble, former member/producer of Grant Lee Buffalo, as well as producer for soundtracks to Velvet Goldmine and City of Angels.

Dean has often said that he's not really a fan of Dear Diary:

<blockquote>
Of course my least favourite song, "Dear Diary" was picked as the single, I came to hate singing "Dear Diary." The stupid "baa-baa" section. The bad lyric - "then you blew my mind." I hated that lyric. It was one of those things that comes out of your mouth when you're singing gibberish, before you've written the lyrics proper. But then you find it's a phrase that you are incapable of replacing. You're stuck with it.
