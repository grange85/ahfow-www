So Füxa put in their final appearance in this series with their most recent record from 2022... although I believe Randall is working on another Füxa album so I wouldn't be surprised if he/they squeezed in again before this series wraps up.

Covered in Stars is an album of the electronic spacey goodness you would expect and has sleeve credits for Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips, although no clues as to where they turn up, although that's Britta singing on the opening track and I suspect that'll be Dean playing guitar on it? 

The album is a picture disc, although still comes in a printed sleeve - the record itself gives no clear declaration of which is the A and which is the B side, and even resorting to tilting the LP at the right angle and reading the matrix numbers doesn't help since the number on side A ends with a B, and the number on side B ends with an A!

Actually I've just noticed that the album has an A side and an AA side - so it's a double a-side album! Of course it's not it may think it is but it has an A side (called A) and a B side (called AA)!

My pressing is very crackly - I hadn't noticed before... maybe I didn't listen to it when I bought it and just went straight to the download?

Füxa release their records on fab London indie Rocket Girl who shortly before this release had celebrated the 20th anniversary of it's "first release proper" with a lovely (if mostly impossible to read) [book, with a compilation CD, a Mogwai flexidisc, and a Bardo Pond / Azusa Plane 7"](https://variousartists19.bandcamp.com/album/rocket-girl-20) - a lovely muddle of formats!
