There were two releases credited to _Dean Wareham_ that were released during Galaxie 500's lifetime, both in 1990, I'm not sure which came out first but I think that Dean's solo outings added to the problems that were already tearing the band apart. This is a cover of Beat Happening's Indian Summer that would later be recorded by, and become a live staple of, Luna.

The single is a 33rpm 7" that was released with Mike McGonigal's Chemical Imbalance fanzine (Vol.2 No.2), I don't have a copy of the magazine and I'm not sure there was any actual Dean/Galaxie content apart from the track on the single (or at least <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/chemical-imbalance-2-2.jpg">none is implied on the cover</a>). Dean's Beat Happening cover is followed on the single by Beat Happening playing Foggy Eyes (a different version than the one on their debut album) and the other three tracks on the EP are from Shimmy Disc Alumni Bongwater, Uncle Wiggly, and The Tinklers.

As often happens, listening to a Beat Happening song sends me down a BH rabbit hole - one of my fave clips on YouTube has been of Beat Happening playing _Cry For a Shadow_ on the street outside a record shop in Memphis and this time I discovered that [someone has uploaded the whole of that show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95XbTgEfSRY) - it's digitised from a VHS tape so neither the sound nor the vision is all that great, although that seems to matter less with Beat Happening, and there's something very beautiful about watching Memphis life go on around them.
