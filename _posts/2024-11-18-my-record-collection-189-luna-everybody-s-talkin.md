In order to get a copy of Luna's Everybody's Talkin' single I subscribed to the Sub Pop Singles Club V2 in 1998 - I was able to get a six month subscription for whatever it cost back then, this was probably the beginning of me buying more than I needed just to get my paws on something for [my record collection](/category/my-record-collection/)

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/luna-everybodys-talkin-single.jpg" "Luna - Everybody's Talkin' / Fuzzy Wuzzy" %}

The other singles I received were of variable quality and I rarely, if ever, revisit them.

- Jesus & Mary Chain - Birthday / Hide Myself _(median on Discogs £17.48)_
- Modest Mouse - Never Ending Math Equation _(£34.82)_
- Sukpatch - Stolen Chrome / Bubble Shaff _(£2.27)_
- Luna - Everybody's Talkin' / Fuzzy Wuzzy (demo) _(£15.20)_
- Team Dresch / Longstocking - It's a Conversation / Never Nowhere _(£6.08)_
- Ron Sexsmith - You Alone _(£5.32)_

Since I rarely played them I suspect they're mostly in NM/VG condition so I could probably make my money back!

Luna's is obviously the best of the lot. [Everybody's Talkin'](/2013/06/05/originals-everybodys-talkin-by-fred-neil-covered-by-luna/) is a treat but what makes this absolutely indispensible is the fabulous [demo version of Fuzzy Wuzzy](/2015/07/14/audio-lost-tracks-fuzzy-wuzzy-demo-by-luna/) on the b-side!
