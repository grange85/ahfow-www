Dean's [latest newsletter](https://deanwareham.com/campaigns/1075458) covers an early trip to London promoting Galaxie 500...

<blockquote>
[A] meeting was set up with Roy [Wilkinson]. Not having done many interviews, I was somewhat resistant to his questions; I think I found it slightly embarrassing that the English music papers would ask serious questions of young kids just starting out in bands, as if we knew anything about the world.

... reminisces about his friendship with Sea Power and Stewart Lee, and about the Krankenhaus festival, and reports that the single version CD of 13 Most Bautiful has finally arrived on streaming platforms...

<blockquote>
we are finally releasing the single-disc edition of 13 Most Beautiful: Songs for Andy Warhol’s Screen Tests at streaming services. This sequence of the album follows the live show we performed, without the extra remixes, and it flows better this way. We are not sure if it’s the algorithm, but one song from this album, “Herringbone Tweed,” has recently become our most streamed song on Apple Music.
