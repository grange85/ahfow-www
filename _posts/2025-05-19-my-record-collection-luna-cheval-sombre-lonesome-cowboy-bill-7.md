This lovely single was released by Feral Child Records in 2017 at the same time as they released the [California Blue / Rock Yr Baby](/2024/12/31/my-record-collection-200-luna-california-blue-rock-yr-baby/) single. The single has Luna performing The Velvet Underground's Lonesome Cowboy Bill on the **a** side, and Cheval Sombre's take on the same song on the **aa** side.

Now I'll admit that this hasn't been out of its sleeve since shortly after it arrived. I have the songs digitally so I have listened to them ocasionally but I've not pulled out the single for years... and there's a story in that:

A few months ago I came across a 1928 film I was unfamiliar with called _Lonesome_ on YouTube, I downloaded it and had it on a USB stick, unwatched, for ages. A couple of weeks ago Hazel and I were spending our last night in Groningen where we'd been to [see a Dean Wareham show](/2025/04/19/diary-dean-wareham-in-groningen-12th-april-2025/). We'd had a lovely day cycling around and so we found ourselves back in the hotel room quite early - there was nothing on the telly, but I did have that USB stick. By this time I'd completely forgotten why I had decided to download Lonesome, and didn't have a clue what it was about.

So... we popped the USB stick into the TV and we watched Lonesome.

What a film! It's a simple and beautiful story of two lonely working people in New York, who have a half-day holiday on the Fourth of July and both end up at Coney Island where they meet, and fall in love, and then get separated, and of course find each other again - how classic a storyline is that? But it is so beautifully told with some smart and cutting edge methods:
 - the film is mostly silent but has three dialog sequences that were put in at the insistence of the studio (and not directed by Paul Fejos) - most folk find these awkward and unnecessary but I must admit that I found it a beautiful surprise and it was lovely hearing Mary and Jim talk
