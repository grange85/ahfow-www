The second VHS in a row, so the second entry that I can't actually watch - although, of course I can because someone has been kind enough to digitise the whole thing and [pop it onto YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aULilR7TS6c) (or, to [download from The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/ShimmyDisc) if you prefer).

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/shimmy-disc-video-compilation-vol-1-vhs.jpg" "The Shimmy Disc Compilation Volume 1 (VHS)" %}

The compilation is packed with the usual Shimmy Disc faces, and compiled with the expected Shimmy Disc idiosyncracies. Each track is introduced with 1980s wedding video style text intros.

Galaxie 500's contribution is Sergio Huidor's video for {% ahfowtrack "Tugboat" %}.

There were two more Shimmy Disc video comps - Volume 2, which I don't have (but am on the lookout for), had the video for {% ahfowtrack "When Will You Come Home" %}, and Volume 3 had no contribution from Galaxie 500 at all. I bought this on eBay in 2014 although not sure for how much.
