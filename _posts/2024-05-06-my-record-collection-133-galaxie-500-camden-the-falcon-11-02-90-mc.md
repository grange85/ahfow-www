I have gone on ad nauseam over the years about how I **wasn't** at this gig that was hastily arranged when The Sundays were forced to postpone their London show, and almost to rub it in someone (again I've forgotten who) sent me this audience recording of the show.

{% ahfowvideo "XtTgFDnGHZY" "Galaxie 500 at The Camden Falcon" "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-camden-falcon-1990-02-11.jpg" %}
Additional _rubbing in_ was provided by Naomi in the [Temperature's Rising oral history book](/2013/03/15/temperatures-rising-an-oral-history-of-galaxie-500-will-come-with-limited-7-single/).

<blockquote>
I think one of my fondest memories of being in the band was when we were opening for the Sundays in England and Harriet [Wheeler] lost her voice and cancelled the London show at the last minute. Rough Trade scrambled to get a gig for us in London that night and came up with a pub; I think it was called The Falcon. It was packed and instead of the big stages that we had been playing with the Sundays we were back to being in our usual atmosphere of a tiny sweaty rock club. It was a really relaxed and completely fun gig-- it just felt like we were cut loose from music business responsibilities and could just play music! I guess the music going well was always at the center of my best memories
