I can't remember how this Galaxie 500 _Radio Sampler_ came into my possession, either a fan sent it to me (if so, thanks) or I bought it on eBay - one thing I'm certain of is that I didn't pay £3.99 for it in Our Price which the sticker on the case suggests&dagger;, since it's a promo and wouldn't/shouldn't be sold in a shop and, more pertinently, Our Price went out of business 5 years before Domino put this out.

This sampler was put out to promote the Domino re-releases in 2009 and collects one track from each of Galaxie 500's albums. Interestingly that while it picks the singles from On Fire (Blue Thunder) and This Is Our Music (Fourth of July), it opts for Oblivious rather than Tugboat from Today.

Not too much to say about this I guess. Like many promos it likes to point out that I don't actually own this (on the sleeve _and_ the disc):

<blockquote>
For promotional use only / not for sale / this promotional CD remains the property of Domino Recording Co Ltd and must be surrendered upon request.
</blockquote>

Hopefully they won't see this post and _request_ its surrender!

_&dagger; - I suspect this arrived without a case and I just repurposed one I had around - I've no idea what happened to the £3.99 single whose case it sits in_
