Damon & Naomi recorded Irving Berlin's perennial classic in 2008 for the film [Lovely, Still](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovely,_Still), a romantic comedy with Martin Landau and Ellen Burstyn, and released it on a limited CDR when they played an in-store at Rough Trade East in London in October 2008.

The CDR was in a plastic envelope with a card insert, and each disc had a different hand design drawn on it by Naomi, I'm not sure _how_ different since I've only ever seen the one copy I own.

The film was shown on C4 over here a few years ago and I completely by accident flicked it on just as Martin and Ellen were dancing to White Christmas - but that's as much of the film as I've ever seen, I have been meaning to catch it all some time.

I assume that Damon & Naomi's version was recorded, like all the best Xmas hits, in the spring or summer, in 2008. It has Michio Kurihara on guitar, Bhob Rainey on sax, and Greg Kelley on trumpet. It was eventually given a digital release on the [Spirit of Love](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/spirit-of-love-b-sides-bonuses-and-soundtracks) Bandcamp compilation of 'b-sides, bonuses, and soundtracks' in 2016.

In the [Originals](/category/originals/) series in 2013 I decided that 'White Christmas' (the song) was a bit shit and that no one except [Darlene Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RB8z28THPc) had been able to make anything worthwhile out of it despite many, many attempts - according to Wikipedia there have been [more than 500 recorded versions of the song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Christmas_(song)#Other_versions), now I haven't listened to them all but I have listened to quite a few and they are all pretty awful!

Damon & Naomi's is, of course, rather lovely - not Darlene lovely, but lovely all the same! 

Seriously though, I'd be happy to hear suggestions of decent versions.
