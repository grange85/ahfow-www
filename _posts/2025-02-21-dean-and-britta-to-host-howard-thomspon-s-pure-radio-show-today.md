<blockquote>
If you read my memoir, you know Howard already, he was head of A&R at Elektra when Luna signed there in 1992, and I spent some fun nights at his Chelsea apartment listening to music and meeting amazing people like Alan Vega, Richard Butler, Angel Corpus Christi and Anthony H. Wilson. Howard signed Suicide, Mot√∂rhead, Psychedelic Furs, the Sugarcubes, Psychedelic Furs, and Roky Erickson to name a few. Now retired from the music biz, he does this radio show twice a month and asked us to sub for him tomorrow. Here are some of the artists featured in the show: James Last, Kramer, Holy Matter, Jess Cornelius, the Tyde, Midnight Magic, England's Glory, Escape-Ism, Norma Tanega, Erny Belle, Princess Chelsea, Michael Rother, John Betjeman, Nancy & Lee, Melenas, Marianne Faithful, Ed Kuepper, Big Search, En Attendant Ana.

The show has been archived and can be [streamed/downloaded here](/articles/dean-and-britta-on-pure-wkpn/).

It's three hours of top notch music with some nice little surprises dotted in amongst all the usual suspects, and well worth popping on while you're washing up, or on your daily commute... and Dean and Britta's lovely commentary...

Howard does a show for WKPN every fortnight and they're always worth a listen - t[he archives](http://archives.wpkn.org/show/profile/1454/-pure-w-howard-thompson) seem to stay up for about a month.

Nice to hear [En Attendant Ana](https://enattendantana.bandcamp.com/) doing a Pogues cover. Just under a year ago Dean DM-ed me on Twitter saying "you should see this band in Newcastle"... so I did, and wasn't disappointed.

No Pogues cover for me - but they did do [Something Stupid in French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcQoDv7i9Gk).
