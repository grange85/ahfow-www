The LP version of [Damon & Naomi's Within These Walls turned up in this series](/2025/10/20/my-record-collection-damon-naomi-within-these-walls-lp/) just a couple of months back so I'm not too sure how much I have to add without repeating myself... but, here goes.

The album was originally only released on CD so this copy is my first, and most played, copy.

I saw Damon & Naomi around the time of release at The Scala on a bill with Sunburned Hand of the Man, I did go with my taping pal Andy but sadly he had a recorder failure and so I only have my memories... and the [review I wrote for AHFoW](/2007/11/26/review-damon-naomi-in-london/) where I...

 - ... was in awe of Kurihara
<blockquote>
Kurihara for the most part stood in the dark and appeared to be playing entirely for his own enjoyment - it was almost as if he barely noticed that he was on a stage, he spent the evening looking down and caressing gorgeous sounds out of his guitar with a mix of fingers and e-bow.
</blockquote>

 - ... and expressed frustration at D&N's 45 minute slot and how Damon might not have made best use of it

<blockquote>
Damon during the set had a couple of bouts rambling banter which would have been fine except I knew they had only 45 minutes and I'd rather have heard an extra song than the lengthy explanation of the _The Black Magic Triangle_ or the translation of Araca Azul. But we got our 45 minutes and nothing more, and all too soon it was over.

I do of course love Damon's rambling introductions and understand that they are a key part of a D&N show, and i do adore how funny Naomi thinks they are!

I still love the album... but still don't love the sleeve (see [the end of the previous post](/2025/10/20/my-record-collection-damon-naomi-within-these-walls-lp/) for an explanation.
