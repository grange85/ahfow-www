So, another appearance for Cheval Sombre and one that nearly slipped through the net, This is a 10" single released by Fat Elvis Records in 2021.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/cheval-sombre-althea-10.jpg" "Cheval Sombre - Althea" %}

The single contains three tracks, Althea on the a-side and Are You Ready and So Far Away on the flip. The credits for the single are written on the label, in tiny, tiny type and ill-chosen colour contrast so I almost missed that 'Are You Ready' credited Dean Wareham on 'electric guitars'.

Are You Ready had also been released on [Cheval Sombre's Days Go By](/2024/07/08/my-record-collection-151-cheval-sombre-days-go-by/) the version on the single is described as a "Sonic Boom AM remix" although is not all that different (to these ears) from the album version, if pushed I'd say that I might prefer the single version.

So Far Away is a cover of the track from Dire Straits' massive Brothers in Arms album and Cheval Sombre's cover is a gloriously gentle and very low-key solo version.
