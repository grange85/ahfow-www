OK, so maybe posting on AHFoW just because Dean & Britta have announced _one more show_ may seem a little extreme ~ but I'm doing it all the same because the show that's just been announced is in a tiny venue a couple of miles down the road from where I live! I gasped when I saw it - Hazel got a little concerned for my wellbeing!

So... on 26th August 2025 Dean & Britta will be playing at The Engine Room in North Shields. I'll be there - you can be there too - [tickets here](https://www.seetickets.com/event/dean-britta/the-engine-room/3429213), although better be quick because it's not a big venue.

And... just becasue... here are the very lovely Snowgoose at The Engine Room a couple of years back:
