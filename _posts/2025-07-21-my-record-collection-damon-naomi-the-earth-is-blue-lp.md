This is the LP of The Earth is Blue that last time out I declared it as "certainly their most beautiful album" and nothing in the two months since that post has changed my mind!

Of course, it is even more beautiful on LP, not because of any of that nonsense about "analog warmth" or "dynamic range" - no, it's more beuatiful on LP because it comes in a 12" square package and therefore has a lovely big version of Naomi's lovely picture on the front... although I do have to say that this meant I noticed two things I hadn't really noticed before:

1. The picture is horizontally flipped and repeated across its two sides... this was the same as on the CD but I never really clicked that this wasn't a lovely wide panorama - nope it's the same picture twice (on the digipack CD it's the same picture two and a bit times).
2. The picture suffered somewhat being blown up to 12" square (twice) and is a little less sharp becuase of that - I guess because it maybe wasn't shot in high enough resolution in the first place? Or maybe the printing let it down slightly.

That said, it's _still_ more beautiful than the CD. The record is in a printed inner sleeve, that is blue monotone but has a selection of photos that were in colour in the CD booklet, but... bigger and differently cropped and the blue tone suits them perfectly - so, despite there being fewer pictures and them having less colour, they are so much better on the LP... look at this lovely picture of Naomi from the LP inner sleeve:

I bought the LP direct from Damon & Naomi in 2013 at the same time as I pre-ordered the [Wondrous World bootleg edition](/2025/06/23/my-record-collection-the-wondrous-world-of-damon-naomi-bootleg-edition/). I paid $12 which was a bargain then... and can still be bought from [Damon & Naomi's online store for just $15](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/p/damon-naomi-the-earth-is-blue) which is even more of a bargain if you take inflation into account, expecially for something *this beautiful*.
