Luna have just played a few dates in the US ~ here are some clips.

Dear Diary has only recently started reappearing in their setlists after a 20+ year absence, here's a nice clip of them playing it in Minneapolis:

Nice also to see that _Black Postcards_ got a rare outing in Chicago:

Always lovely to hear Bewitched, here they are playing it in Minneapolis:

In the intro to that show Dean talks about a show they played at The Fine Line on a day off from recording Pup Tent at a nearby studio... Jason just sent me a ticket scan:
