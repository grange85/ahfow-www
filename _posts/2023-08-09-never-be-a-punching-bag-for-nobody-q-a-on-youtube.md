Naomi Yang's lovely film _Never Be a Punching Bag for Nobody_ was premiered at the Boston Independent Film Festival back in April and as part of the presentation there was a Q&A with Naomi and Sal Bartolo Jr - the owner of the gym that featured heavily in the film.

Naomi has now put the [full Q&A on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvh0BUaLh8I) and it is well worth checking out... if you've seen the film. 

If you haven't already seen the film you can still [rent it through Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/punchingbag).
