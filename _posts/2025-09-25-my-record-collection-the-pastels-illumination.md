So...  a second copy of The Pastels excellent Illumination. I think I bought this in a bundle with some things I didn't have, or I just added it to make up postage. But, whatever reason I do have two copies!

_... and since I have two copies I can photograph both sides of the fold-out booklet in one pic!_

To be honest I was going to skip this one when it popped up in my backlog but... I have actually seen The Pastels since [I last posted about the album](/2023/05/04/my-record-collection-031-the-pastels-illumination/) over two years ago... and they don't play very often! So... I guess I can write about that...

Back in July, just before they were scheduled to play Glas-Goes-Pop The Pastels had a matinee gig scheduled at The Cumberland Arms in Byker - only their second live show since 2019 (the first had been a couple of weeks earlier in Edinburgh). It was a swelteringly hot afternoon - and inside the crowded room was ridiculous! I arrived early, almost too early, so when the doors opened I positioned myself against the wall near the front of the stage (it's my position of choice at The Cumberland Arms).

Support was from Carla J. Easton who played a charming and lively set.

The break arrived and, having been spotted by Janet in the crowd, we both retired outside into the fresh air for a chat before The Pastels. The breeze was refreshing and under some circumstances I might have been tempted to stay in the garden... or at least stand by the open door. But... The Pastels! So, as showtime approached I edged my way back close to where I had been standing.

The Pastels were, of course, wonderful - as they always are - cracking songs (including a couple from Illumination!), charming between songs banter, and knowing when it's too hot to carry on so not overstaying their welcome!

I briefly chatted with Pastels guitarist John (also of the excellent [National Park](http://www.nationalparksite.com/)) about how great Dean Wareham's new album is. Said a quick "hello" to Stephen and headed out into the cool, and then onto the hot metro, and then home.

Oh... and also since the last Illumination post I hung out in a pub in Glasgow with The Pastels!
