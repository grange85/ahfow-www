The Earth is Blue was Damon & Naomi's fifth&dagger; album and was the first release on their own 20\|20\|20 record label, released on the 14th February 2005 it has, in _Beautiful Close Double_ and _A Second Life_ the most beuatiful opening of any D&N album.

I ordered this direct from Damon & Naomi, I know this since I have snipped off the bit of the Jiffy bag that it came in that Naomi had writteb "Hi Andy!" on. I have it tucked it into the sleeve. Since I ordered it from them it meant I also got a bonus five song CD of Damon & Naomi live in Tokyo with Kurihara and Takizawa of Ghost (which will obv turn up later in this series). I don't think I bought the LP at the same time, but I do have the LP so... maybe I did.

It really is a breathtakingly beautiful album, maybe their most beautiful... particularly the songs Naomi sings on, as well as the two I mention above, _The Robot Speaks_ is also brilliant and the cover of _While My Guitar Gently Weeps_ is pretty darned sweet too.
