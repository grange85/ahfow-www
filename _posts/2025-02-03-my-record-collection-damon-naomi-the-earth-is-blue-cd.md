The Earth is Blue was Damon & Naomi's fifth&dagger; studio album and was the first release on their own 20\|20\|20 record label, released on the 14th February 2005 it has, in _Beautiful Close Double_ and _A Second Life_ the most beuatiful opening of any D&N album.

In fact I was blown away by _Beautiful Close Double_ from the first listen:

<blockquote>
I just noticed that D&N have Beautiful Close Double available for a
download on their website - if you haven't (yet) bought the album - or
if you've constantly dismissed D&N then please PLEASE go and download
it. <strong>It really is the best thing they've ever done</strong>.

... and I wasn't alone:

<blockquote>
I know it's too easy to stop open mouthed at an opening track
(particularly one that was released in advance on a magazine
coverdisc) and say how great it is but I honestly think Beautiful
Close Double is as good a track as D&N have ever done - it is just
gorgeous and when that brass comes in &lt;swoon&gt;...

I'd still say it is one of Damon & Naomi's very highest points (although I just noticed that they seem to rarely play it live) - and the rest of the album isn't too shabby either!!

The CD had a hype sticker with a quote from The Boston Phoenix. The quote is actually from the [19th to 25th November edition](https://archive.org/details/sim_boston-phoenix_november-19-25-2004_33_47/page/4/mode/2up?q=spectorish) of the paper promoting a live show... so a review (of sorts) of an album close to three months ahead of release.

<blockquote>
The rumors are true: Damon & Naomi, have gone all Phil Spectorish on us... The Earth Is Blue includes a small horn section and all manner of harmonic enhancement, and itâ€™s a lush, intoxicating beauty.<br/>

I ordered this direct from Damon & Naomi, I know this since I have snipped off the bit of the Jiffy bag that it came in that Naomi had writteb "Hi Andy!" on. I have it tucked it into the sleeve. Since I ordered it from them it meant I also got a bonus five song CD of Damon & Naomi live in Tokyo with Kurihara and Takizawa of Ghost (which will obv turn up later in this series). I don't think I bought the LP at the same time, but I do _have_ the LP so... maybe I did.
