<p>Old Toy Trains was recorded by Roger Miller in 1967 and released on a single by Smash records... and here's a video of that very single on YouTube, with an old toy car</p>

<p>Dean & Britta first made available their cover of Old Toy Trains as a giveaway across the Internet in December 2004 (it was available to download from Luna's site, Sonic Boom's site and AHFoW).</p>

<div class="well"><p class="audio">Audio: <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/audio/00_dean-britta-sonic-boom-old-toy-trains-2004.mp3">Old Toy Trains by Dean & Britta with Sonic Boom</a></p><audio controls="controls" preload="none" src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/audio/00_dean-britta-sonic-boom-old-toy-trains-2004.mp3"></audio></div>

<p>In 2006 the song was remixed by Sonic Boom and given away again</p>

<p>And in 2007 the remix version was released as a lovely 7" single by Chimney Rocks Records on the b-side of another Christmas song He's Coming Home.</p>
<p>And as a bonus, I get to post a Nana Mouskouri cover on AHFoW for the second time this year... Nana released it on her 1972 <a href="http://www.discogs.com/Nana-Mouskouri-Christmas-With-Nana-Mouskouri/release/1461937">Christmas with Nana Mouskouri</a> album</p>
