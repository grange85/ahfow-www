<blockquote>Even at six tracks, it’s stunning how much life (and death) Wareham spreads over these tracks, and makes these tiny whispers of songs feel like the biggest secret anyone’s ever told you.</p></blockquote>

<div id="lobf"><strong><a href="http://thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/dean-wareham-emancipated-hearts-139265">2013-10-14: The Line of Best Fit 7/10</a></strong><br />
<blockquote>There’s rarely a moment over the past 25 years where Dean Wareham’s failed to deliver an album that’s at least three-quarters brilliant, and Emancipated Hearts doesn’t change that record. Class is permanent. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Now on Emancipated Hearts we have a reminder of how Dean Wareham is a talent of the first rank, his heart emancipated, his songwriting reliant on more than just his magical guitar work to fulfill a song.  May we have another helping?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Emancipated Hearts isn't just a mini-album, it's a minor masterpiece</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>&hellip; his first solo album is characteristically refined and intimate, sung in a hymnlike mumble and steeped in the Velvet Underground, classical string drones, synth-pop and country music.</p></blockquote>

<div id="doa"><ins datetime="2013-10-29T22:25:16+00:00"><strong><a href="http://www.adequacy.net/2013/10/dean-wareham-emancipated-hearts/">2013-10-28: Delusions of Adequacy (DOA)</a></strong><br />
<blockquote>Ably assisted by Papercuts’ Jason Quever on production and multi-instrumentalist duties, long-running musical partner Britta Phillips on bass and backing vocals, violinist Gillian Rivers and drummer Anthony LaMarca, Wareham delivers Emancipated Hearts through a dark yet dreamy fog, honouring his past pedigree as well as finding fresh dimensions for his songcraft in the process.</p></blockquote>

<div id="indy"><ins datetime="2013-11-01T22:25:16+00:00"><strong> i-Independent review by Andy Gill</strong><br />
<blockquote>DEAN WAREHAM EMANCIPATED HEARTS (Sonic Cathedral)<br /> If evidence were required of Lou Reed's influence, this mini-album from the ex-Galaxie 500 frontman supplies plenty. Reed's literary leanings are echoed in its track titles; ahnd the blend of guitar and violin that dominates is traceable to the Velvets' "Venus in Furs". Wareham's fragile delivery imparts vulnerability to "The Deadliest Day Since the Invasion Began", but finds its natural home in the lilt of "Air". </p></blockquote>

<div id="radar"><ins datetime="2013-11-07T23:14:57+00:00"><strong> Under The Radar review by Billy Hamilton - 8/10</strong><br />
<blockquote>This mini-LP embodies the world-wearied experiences of its creator, exploring darker themes through a series of slow, winding sonic arrangements. It's not a sad album—far from it—but a deep-seated sense of vulnerability writhes through each tenderly sculpted number.</p></blockquote>
