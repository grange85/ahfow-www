<p>Nope! Not those Wailers, these Wailers were from Tacoma Washington and one of their biggest fans (according to Wikipedia) was a young Jimi Hendrix. They recorded She's Coming Home for a Christmas album they shared with fellow garage bands The Sonics and The Galaxies (weird... Sonics (like Sonic Boom) and Galaxies like in 500!) in 1965<p>

<p>Dean & Britta's version was gender adjusted, recorded (again) with Sonic Boom and released on a single by Chimney Rocks! Records (the b-side of which has <a href="/2013/12/16/originals-xmas-special-1-old-toy-trains-by-roger-miller-covered-by-dean-britta-with-sonic-boom/">already put in an appearance on this list</a>).</p>

<p>The whole of this splendid Christmas album is <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/7lrqx7ImWuv9KlSDc6pVkB">available on Spotify</a>, and is worth the time (although judicious use of that skip button is advised).</p>
