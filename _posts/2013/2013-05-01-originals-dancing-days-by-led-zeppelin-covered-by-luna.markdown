The existence of Luna's cover of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Days">Led Zep's Dancing Days</a> was first mentioned way back in a post on the band's official web site (fuzzywuzzy.com - but I think the post got lost in one of the reboots that site got) - it didn't however see the light until the band released Close Cover Before Striking in digital form in 2011.</p>
<p>Zeppelin's original appeared on their 1973 album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houses_of_the_Holy">Houses of the Holy</a><br />
