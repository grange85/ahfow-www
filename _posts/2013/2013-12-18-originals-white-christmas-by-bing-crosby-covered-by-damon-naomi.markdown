<p>White Christmas was written by Irving Berlin and got it's first airing, recorded by Bing Crosby on Christmas Day 1941, appeared in a film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn_%28film%29">Holiday Inn (1942)</a> and then became so famous it was give <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Christmas_(film)">a film all of its own in 1954</a><br />

<p>It was then recorded by pretty much everybody, Damon & Naomi's version was also recorded for a film, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovely,_Still">Lovely, Still (2008)</a> - <a href="http://youtu.be/Jy8hPGvuTZM?t=1h1m4s">this link may jump you to the bit in the film where Damon & Naomi sing while Martin Landau and Ellen Burstyn dance</a>.</p>
<p>The track was first released as CDR sold at a UK instore in 2008 and subsequently given away on their website. The song features Naomi on piano, Damon on nylon-string guitar, Michio Kurihara on electric guitar, Bhob Rainey on soprano sax, and Greg Kelley on trumpet.</p>

<p>I thought as a seasonal addendum I'd hunt down a few classic versions, but beyond Darlene Love's perfect version on the Spector Christmas album, almost no one has managed to make a go of it - some songs, I guess are just awful - even a song that's sold 100 million copies!</p>

<p>There's a 1972 cover that is described on Wikipedia as...</p>
<blockquote><p> Shu-Bi-Dua, Denmark, released a rock version of the song under the title "Rap Jul" ("Quack Christmas") with Danish lyrics depicting a duck (that turns out to be none other than Donald Duck) not looking forward to Christmas, because all humans tend to eat duck at Christmas Eve.</p></blockquote>
<p>... which sounds like it'd be awesome but frankly I'm afraid it's <a href="http://youtu.be/fXlyRjshoGc">still a bit of a turd</a>.</p>
<p>I'll stop there with the advice that aside from D&N and Darlene Love's versions I'd suggest you give White Christmas a wide berth and find yourself another Christmas classic, personally I'd recommend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARq6uYSsUq0">this one</a></p>
