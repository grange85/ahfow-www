<strong>June 11:</strong><br />
Laundry day. I feel sick. The tumble dryers aren't working properly. I walk about Hamburg, pick up a copy of "Moonshot" by Buffy St. Marie, and am starting to feel feverish. We're playing another arena, the Sporthalle, capacity 7,000 or so. The Velvets play an extra long set tonight, two and a half hours. I sleep for about three hours and wake up drenched with sweat but feeling better.</p>

<p class="text-muted">In April 1993 Luna were invited to open for The Velvet Underground on their reunion tour around Europe. Dean Wareham kept a diary of the tour which was published in the November 1993 issue of Alternative Press, I've just lifted that article and chopped it up into days and will post it here over the coming days - all without permission - if anyone objects give me a shout.</p>
