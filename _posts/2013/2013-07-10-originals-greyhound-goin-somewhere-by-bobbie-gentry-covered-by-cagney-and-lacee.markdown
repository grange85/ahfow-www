<p class="lead">Greyhound Goin' Somewhere was written by R. Dorsey and M. Murphy about whom I know nothing. It was recorded by the fantastic Bobbie Gentry on her splendid 1969 album Touch 'em With Love</p>

<p>Sadly there's no video of Bobbie Gentry singing this and as I'll not get another chance to post about her on AHFoW here's her singing the title track of Touch 'Em With Love on The Morecambe and Wise Show in 1969</p>

<p>And here's her version of Bacharach and David's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_%27Em_with_Love">I'll Never Fall in Love Again</a> which has the <strong>very best rhyming couplet in all music</strong>!</p>
<blockquote>You get enough germs to catch pneumonia<br />After you do he'll never phone ya</blockquote>
