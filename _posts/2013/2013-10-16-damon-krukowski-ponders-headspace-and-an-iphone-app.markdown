<p>In his now blossoming alternate career as a journalist Damon has written an <a href="http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/103-canopener-headphones/">article for Pitchfork</a> discussing how we listen to music in the modern age and an app that tries to take us back to the way we used to listen to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>For a listener like me, whose prized teen possession was a turntable with a smoked plastic dustcover, CanOpener makes music on headphones sound more "realistic" because I feel I can better locate where it comes from.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Headphones, for all their clarity and detail, leave a blank in the middle of our foreheads. As a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers puts it: "There are large errors in sound position perception associated with headphones, especially for the most important visual direction, out in frontâ€¦it is very difficult to externalize sounds and avoid the inside-the-head sensation."</p></blockquote>
