<p>Dean & Britta have scheduled a performance of their show 13 Most Beautiful: Songs for Andy Warhol's Screen Tests in <span class="removed_link" title="http://themaclive.com/all-listings/?eventID=5404">Belfast on the 16 February at The Mac</span>. No word yet if their trip to this side of the pond will include any other shows, but my fingers are crossed!</p>
