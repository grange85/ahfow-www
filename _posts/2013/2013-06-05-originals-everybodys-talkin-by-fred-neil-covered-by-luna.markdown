<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Neil">Fred Neil</a> released his original of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody%27s_Talkin%27">Everybody's Talkin'</a> on his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Neil_%28album%29">second (eponymous) album</a> in 1966.<br />

<p>In 1969 Nillson's cover of the song was picked by John Schelsinger as the theme tune to Midnight Cowboy and thus began my (and many others) misconception that it was a Nillson original!<br />

<p>Fairly sure I was only set straight when Luna released their kazoo-tastic cover of it on the Sub Pop Singles Club in 1998<br />
