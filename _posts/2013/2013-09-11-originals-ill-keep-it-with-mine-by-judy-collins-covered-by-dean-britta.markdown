<p>Another Dylan song that Dylan didn't release - the first official release of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ll_Keep_It_with_Mine">I'll Keep It With Mine</a> was a rather splendid, and surprisingly jaunty version by Judy Collins, released in 1965:</p>

<div class="well"><p class="audio">Audio: <a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/audio/5-09_Judy%20Collins_I'll%20Keep%20It%20With%20Mine.m4a">m4a</a></p><audio controls="controls" preload="none" src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/audio/5-09_Judy%20Collins_I'll%20Keep%20It%20With%20Mine.m4a"></audio></div>

<p>The version we're more familiar with was by Nico recorded for her first solo album Chelsea Girl:<br />

<p>In an <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/dean-wareham,43887/">interview for AV Club</a> however Dean suggested that their cover owed more to the version by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainy_Day_%28band%29">Paisley Underground supergroup Rainy Day</a>.</p>

<blockquote>We kind of like the version by Rainy Day, which was this supergroup featuring David Roback, Kendra Smith, Susanna Hoffs, a Paisley Underground thing. Thatâ€™s kind of what we based that on.</blockquote>

<p>But this is my favourite version by Fairport Convention featuring the wonderful Sandy Denny in 1969<br />

<p>Dean & Britta recorded it for Nico's screen test in 13 Most Beautiful and it has been released on the accompanying album and a couple of 7" singles - all CD and vinyl releases feature one of two remixes by the <a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/blogs/the-city/Scott-Hardkiss-Remember-His-Music-201340731.html">late Scott Hardkiss</a> - but <a href="/2010/10/02/13-most-beautiful-the-missing-mixes/">Britta allowed this site to share the unremixed version</a>.</p>
