<p>It's that time of year again where you get to vote in the 19th A Head Full of Wishes. Vote for your favourite Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon & Naomi and Dean & Britta album and five tracks. One lucky voter will get a couple of 7" singles - probably <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/database/discography/dean_and_britta/216">this one</span>, <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/database/discography/luna/54">this one</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/database/discography/luna/71">last one of these</a> I'll ever give away!</p>
