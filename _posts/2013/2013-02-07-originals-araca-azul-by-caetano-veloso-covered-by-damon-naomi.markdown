<p>It seems all the As in my originals series are Damon & Naomi ones - second is their cover of Brazilian legend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caetano_Veloso">Caetano Veloso</a>'s Araçá azul. </p>
<p>Original: Caetano Veloso - Araçá azul<br />

<p>Damon & Naomi cover - this actually runs into the next track The Earth is Blue... so expect a sudden finish!<br />
