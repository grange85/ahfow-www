<p>OK - a little late with this one but <a href="http://www.musichallofwilliamsburg.com/event/211383-jim-james-brooklyn">Dean Wareham is playing tonight at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn supporting Jim James</a> (or My Morning Jacket) - the site says "sold out" so this post is mostly saying <em>if you're lucky enough to have tickets, get there early</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://backstagerider.com/2013/02/18/dean-wareham-britta-phillips-solo/">The lovely Backstage Rider</a> has a post with little teases about upcoming solo albums by Dean & Britta (two already recorded for Dean...</p>
<blockquote><p>I have pretty much recorded two full albums, one produced by Jim James (My Morning Jacket) in Louisville, Kentucky, the other produced by Jason Quever (Papercuts) in San Francisco. At some point these will be released under my name, but label and release date are still to be determined</p></blockquote>
<p>... and one in progress from Britta)</p>
<p>Damon & Naomi are of for their first trip down under in April, they play in Brisbane, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney between the 10th and 15th of April and for a couple of days in the middle they "will be participating in events at the University of Melbourne". <a href="http://damonandnaomi.com/tours/">Tour dates on their web site</a>.</p>
<p>Don't forget <a href="http://internationalsadhits.tumblr.com/">Damon has a Tumblr</a> where he posts ruminations on music and the music industry as well as posting his novel "Self Storage" as he writes it.</p>
<p>And this from a week or so back is worth a smile...</p>
