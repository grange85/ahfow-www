On <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=550426371656223&set=pb.105076796191185.-2207520000.1361827585&type=3&theater">Facebook this afternoon</a> Damon & Naomi shared the cover art and gave a few snippets of information about a new release of their second album "The Wondrous World of Damon & Naomi" for Record Store Day. </p>
<blockquote><p>It's an alternate version of the album, from 1995 - a master tape we thought was lost but turned up in Kramer's things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More details as soon as I have any.</p>
