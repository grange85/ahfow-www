Here are some of the rather lovely reviews that Emancipated Hearts has been getting:</p>
<blockquote><p>"If evidence were required of Lou Reed's lingering influence, this charming mini-album from the former Galaxie 500 frontman Dean Wareham supplies plenty" - The Independent</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"It’s stunning how much life (and death) Wareham spreads over these tracks, and makes these tiny whispers of songs feel like the biggest secret anyone’s ever told you" - Pitchfork</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"Dean Wareham's first solo album is characteristically refined and intimate, sung in a hymnlike mumble and steeped in the Velvet Underground, classical string drones, synth-pop and country music" - Rolling Stone</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"There’s rarely a moment over the past 25 years where Dean Wareham’s failed to deliver an album that’s at least three-quarters brilliant, and Emancipated Hearts doesn’t change that record. Class is permanent" - The Line Of Best Fit</p></blockquote>
