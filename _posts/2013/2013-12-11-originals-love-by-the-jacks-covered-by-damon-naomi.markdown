<p>So.. an album track by 60s Japanese psych/folk/rock band, that ain't gonna be on YouTube is it... and it wasn't, but it is now.</p>
<p>Love was released on <del datetime="2013-12-11T23:52:14+00:00">The</del> Jacks 1968 album Vacant World, I'll pinch Wikipedia's description of the band because I rather love how <del datetime="2013-12-11T23:52:14+00:00">The</del> Jacks pretty much cover everything ...</p>
<blockquote><p>Jacks played in a distinct musical style fused with ambient psychedelic, surf, folk and jazz. The group had a dark, introspective sound with an exploratory, improvisational edge and sometimes headed into moody instrumental excursions. The Jacks typically employed reverb, tremolo and subtle fuzz-guitar and also utilized the vibraphone, organ and wind instruments such as the flute.</p></blockquote>

<p>Damon & Naomi recorded it in 2001 for their fake live album Live in San Sebastian - here they are performing it with members of Ghost, saxophonist Bhob Rainey and cellist Helene Espvall in Tokyo in 2008<br />
