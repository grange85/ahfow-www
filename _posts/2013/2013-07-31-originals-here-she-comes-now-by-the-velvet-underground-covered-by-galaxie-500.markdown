<p>Here She Comes Now was from The Velvet Underground's second album, White Light/White Heat - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_She_Comes_Now">it has a wikipeida page if you need to know more than that</a>. It apparently only exists in two known versions, the one from the album and a demo that turned up on the Peel Slowly... box set.</p>
<p>LP version<br />

<p>And a cool recording for UK TV turned up on the DVD<br />
