<p>So John Lennon makes his second appearance in this series - he'll be back when we reach the <em>R</em>s for 70% of a track. </p>
<p>Jealous Guy started out as Child of Nature, written after The Beatles attended a lecture by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and demoed at Harrison's home in Esher in 1968.<br />

<p>The track never made it onto a Beatles album and was rewritten as Jealous Guy for Lennon's Imagine.<br />

<p>Luna recorded the track for Noah Baumbach's 1997 film Mr Jealousy</p>
