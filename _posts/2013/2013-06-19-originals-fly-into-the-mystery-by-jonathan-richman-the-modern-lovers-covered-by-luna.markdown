I think Fly Into The Mystery might have been another song recorded in the 1973 sessions with Kim Fowley (although as mentioned in the entry on <a href="/2013/05/15/originals-dont-let-our-youth-go-to-waste-by-jonathan-richman-covered-by-galaxie-500">Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste</a> this is not clear-cut) - this recording is available on the Songs of Remembrance bootleg :<br />

Live versions are available dating from as early as 1971 - such as this one from a recently unearthed bootleg:<br />

<p>It turned up officially on the 1977 release Rock and Roll With The Modern Lovers<br />

<p>Luna's version first turned up on the <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/discography/luna/104">Benicassim 98</a> compilation listed as "Fly Into The Sun" and then on the Italian compilation <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/discography/luna/156">Homesleephome2</a> and later on the digital only <a href="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/discography/luna/206">Lunafied</a>.</p>
