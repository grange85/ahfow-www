<p><a href="http://www.damonandnaomi.com/">Damon & Naomi</a> are home from Australia <a href="http://www.yetipublishing.com/G500.html">releasing books</a> and <a href="/2013/04/23/wondrous-world-of-damon-naomi-bootleg-edition/">new/old records</a> and publishing e-zines. </p>
<blockquote><p>Back home, and excited to announce a virtual journey into the unknown – we are launching an Exact Change e-zine, through the auspices of 29th Street Publishing. There’s a sneak preview in a special free number of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/maura-magazine/id590812236?mt=8">Maura Magazine</a> (the Maura app is also free, once you have it look for the  “Introducing” issue). This is for iPads and iPhones only, so plug in everyone!</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously that last sentence is a bit careless because the first phrase makes the second phrase impossible &lt;sigh&gt;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">Dean & Britta</a> meanwhile have headed out west and have been house-hunting and shining up new solo albums - three of them I believe. They've also been <a href="http://www.ifcfilms.com/videos/frances-ha-trailer">appearing in the new Noah Baumbach film Frances Ha</a></p>

<p>My <a href="/database/">database</a> has been running with mostly just cosmetic changes for years (apart from a misguided attempt at getting it into a wiki), one of the features of it is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AHeadFullOfWishes-UpcomingShows">a list (and an RSS feed) of upcoming shows</a> - this too has been ticking away for years with no problems (and admittedly very few visits/subscriptions) - a few weeks ago it broke, which seemed odd - nothing had changed over the years it had been gladly ticking away... I eventually tracked down what had changed - for the first time in as many years as it's been running it has had <strong>no upcoming gigs to report</strong>.</p>
<p>I resisted the temptation to title this post <strong>Bands don't tour and break long-established web site</strong></p>
