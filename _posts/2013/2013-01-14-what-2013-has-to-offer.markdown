<p>OK, to be honest I'm not too sure of what's on the horizon but to break the silence here's a little of what I do know...</p>
<p>Damon & Naomi are playing a couple of dates at the end of January in Europe with Richard Youngs. Firstly they're at <a href="http://www.cafeoto.co.uk/richard-youngs-damon-and-naomi-seaming.shtm">Cafe Oto in London on 26th of January</a> and then they'll be playing the MO'FO festival in Paris on the 27th.</p>
<p>Naomi has been working on more film projects and some sneak preview stills have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Damon-Naomi/105076796191185">turned up on facebook</a><br />

<p>Dean & Britta have one performance of 13 Most beautiful scheduled for <a href="https://www.jccsf.org/arts-ideas/performances/film/dean-britta/">9 February at the Jewish Community Center of San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>Dean has been finishing off some tracks from his solo album at La La Land studios in Louisville with My Morning Jacket's Jim James - Britta has posted some photos from there on her <a href="https://twitter.com/brittaphillips">Twitter</a> (via Instagram)<br />

<p>Dean & Britta have played on a track on the new album by Gryphon Rue "Good mourning, Short companions". The album has just been released and is available at a price of whatever you want to pay!</p>
<p>Damon's been writing a novel on his tumblr <a href="http://internationalsadhits.tumblr.com/">International Sad Hits</a> as well as pondering the state of music on <a href="https://twitter.com/dada_drummer">his twitter</a> - both are worth following.</p>
<p>It looks like Mike McGonigal's long-awaited book "Temperature's Rising: An Oral History of Galaxie 500" might actually see the light of day this year (close to two years after it's first mooted publication). Amazon has it scheduled for release on 12 March - but I won't hold my breath. Gregg Einhorn who did the design for the book posted to the AHFoW Facebook page that "we just sent this off to the printers and should be out in March" which I guess means that the books might actually physically exist now!<br />

<p>News on the vinyl reissue of Luna's Penthouse has gone a little quiet - if anyone knows anything...</p>
