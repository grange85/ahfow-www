<p><strong>Vote on the 2013 A Head Full of Wishes survey</strong></p>
<p>OK... maybe not the last call,  but the last post I'll do on here about it. If you take the AHFoW survey this year you'll be entered in a draw for this lot:<br />
That copy of Dear Paulina on the right is positively the last one I'll be giving away - if you don't get one in the draw you'll have to keep an eye on eBay and Discogs to get a copy from now on in.</p>
<p><strong>Vote on the 2013 A Head Full of Wishes survey</strong></p>
<p>Head over to the survey form and choose your favourite album and five favourite tracks by Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon & Naomi and Dean & Britta. Remember you only need to include your email address if you want to be entered in the draw (if you've already voted and forgot to include your email address, <a href="/about/contact-me/" title="Contact me">get in touch</a>).</p>
<p>I'm jazzing up the results page - you can see how that's going by checking out how last year's survey went - please <a href="/about/contact-me/" title="Contact me">get in touch</a> if anything looks wrong or screwy!</p>
