<p>This is a song from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_%28film%29">Robert Altman's rather splendid film Nashville</a> (there'll be another later in the series). The only clip I can find on Youtube is this one, out of synch and subtitled in Spanish (you could however <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tdIW1se4yI">watch the whole film (with the director's audio commentary)</a> there!). It's performed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gibson">Henry Gibson</a></p>

And yes, it's that Henry Gibson... the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_%26_Martin%27s_Laugh-In">Laugh In</a> poet...</p>

<p>... and leader of the Illinois Nazis (in Blues Brothers)</p>
