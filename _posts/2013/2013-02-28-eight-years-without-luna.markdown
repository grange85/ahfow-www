<p>Eight years ago Luna played their last ever show at The Bowery Ballroom in New York City, I don't do this every year (in fact i think it <a href="/2008/02/28/three-years-ago-today/">might be five years since I commemorated the end of Luna on this site</a>) so here's a little reminder of how Luna finished:<br />

<strong>The encore:</strong><br />
<a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/audio/Luna_2005-02-28_ Bowery Ballroom_20_Luna_Indian Summer.mp3">Indian Summer</a> [audio https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/audio/luna/Luna_2005-02-28_%20Bowery%20Ballroom_20_Luna_Indian%20Summer.mp3]<br />
<a href="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/audio/luna-20050228-23-minutes-in-brussels-nyc.mp3">23 Minutes in Brussels</a> [audio https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/audio/luna/Luna_2005-02-28_%20Bowery%20Ballroom_21_Luna_23%20Minutes%20in%20Brussels.mp3]</p>
<blockquote><p>We played "Indian Summer" for the very last time, and I thought, we're playing it for the last time. I had always enjoyed listening to Sean's beautiful guitar solo, the way he bent certain notes on his Jazzmaster. Tonight I moved stage left, so I could hear it better. Then I counted down to the end, the two notes that  go back and forth all through the song, and launched into "23 Minutes in Brussels," which builds to a pounding climax but then falls apart softly and slowly. We exited the stage, and it was a relief to be walking upstairs, knowing that we would not be back the very next night"</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The website:</strong><br />
<a href="http://lunaslastwaltz.blogspot.co.uk">Luna's Last Waltz</a> was a group blog documenting Luna's last weekend - a lot of the pictures have gone AWOL but the site content is still there with fans (mostly me) wittering on about the end. Includes posts from Dean and <a href="http://lunaslastwaltz.blogspot.co.uk/2005/03/email-from-britta.html">Britta</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Britta and I trudged upstairs and out into the snowstorm and hailed a cab at the corner of Bowery and Delancey. It felt good to be heading north.</p></blockquote>
