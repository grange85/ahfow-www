<p>I was at work yesterday afternoon counting down the seconds to Dean Wareham's first London show for two and a half years when an email arrived </p>
<blockquote><p>might not make it to London today. Our train has been sitting on the tracks for 2 hours and we are just outside Manchester</p></blockquote>
<p>This was followed by flurries of tweets and email and Facebook posts as good folk tried to work out how to get the band to London, ultimately the best advice was probably sit tight and eventually the train started moving.</p>
<p>The band arrived late, but arrived, and with a later start than scheduled, Jason Quever of Papercuts rushed though a short and sweet support set, joined for the last couple of songs by Britta and (drummer) Anthony.</p>
<p>Dean arrived onstage with Britta, Anthony and Jason making up the band and opened with <em>Love Is Colder Than Death</em> and followed it with a very wonderful set of new and old, the old including Galaxie 500s <em>Tell Me</em>, <em>When Will You Come Home</em>, and of course<em> Tugboat </em>& Luna's <em>Moon Palace</em> and <em>Lost in Space</em>.</p>
<p>Encore was a sensational <em>Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste</em> and <em>Ceremony</em>.</p>
<p>A splendid end to a gig that almost didn't happen.<br />

<p><em>This post has been written on my phone I'll jazz it up at the weekend just wanted to get the thoughts down.</em></p>
