I picked up my copy of <a href="http://www.yetipublishing.com/G500.html">Temperature's Rising: Galaxie 500: an oral and visual history</a> from the PO this morning. It sat on my desk all morning while I worked - grr - so didn't get a proper look until lunchtime. Here are some idle thoughts:</p>
<p>The softback book feels gorgeous. A good size and felt solid and comfortable on my lap as I carefully flicked through it.</p>
<p>I mostly looked at the pictures... and there are so many pictures - the book is just bursting with pictures of all sorts of Galaxie 500 ephemera from original art to snaps, from receipts to postcards. </p>
<p>I feel very lucky, as a Galaxie 500 fan, at just how well I've been treated over the years. This website was born in 1994 when the LPs were out of print. Since then we've had a beautiful box set, a live album, a Peel sessions album, a double DVD of live videos, Dean's autobiography, and now a fabulous book of memories and revelations.</p>
<p>The story is beautiful and tragic - I always cry at the end (and at bits in the middle).<br />

Honestly, you were never going to get "objective" from me - but surely even the most objective reviewer would find it hard to not be rather pleased at this stunning piece of work!</p>
