<p>So few shows so far this year but this one's a bit of a doozy. On the 5th of July Dean & Britta are performing at First Avenue in Minneapolis in a show that's billed as "<a href="http://first-avenue.com/event/2013/07/bathysphere-fri">BATHYSPHERE: A PSYCHONAUTICAL VOYAGE featuring DEAN & BRITTA play Galaxie 500</a>" with support from Sonic Boom and Cheval Sombre, amongst others.</p>
<p><a href="http://first-avenue.com/event/2013/07/bathysphere-fri">Tickets go on sale on 31 May</a></p>
