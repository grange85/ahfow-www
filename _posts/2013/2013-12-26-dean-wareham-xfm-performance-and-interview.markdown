<p>While Dean was in London last a couple of weeks back he recorded a couple of tracks for a session for John Kennedy's Xposure show on Xfm - you can hear some of the interview and a cover of Old Toy Trains with Dean on guitar and Britta on iPad in the latest issue of the Xposure podcast.</p>

<p>Head about thirteen minutes in for Dean's interview and performance - you'd probably also want to stick around to hear the Younghusband cover of Margo Guryan's <em>I Don't Intend to Spend Christmas Without You</em> that follows straight after</p>
