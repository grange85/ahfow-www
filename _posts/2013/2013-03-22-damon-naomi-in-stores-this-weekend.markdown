<p>Damon & Naomi have a couple of free in-store performances this weekend (assuming the weekend starts on a Friday which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Steady_Go!">Ready Steady Go!</a> assured me it did).</p>
<p>Today at 9pm they'll be performing at Portsmouth Book and Bar at 40 Pleasant St, Portsmouth, NH. </p>
<p>And then tomorrow they'll be playing the rescheduled show (postponed by the weather a couple of weeks back) at <a href="http://willimanticrecords.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/saturday-march-23rd-at-1pm-damon-naomi.html">1pm at Willimantic Records</a> - 744 Main St, Willimantic, CT.</p>
