<p>Damon has written an <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/oped/9093-alt-weeklies/">opinion piece for Pitchfork on underground media</a> in the wake of the closing of The Boston Phoenix. I'll not try and summarise it here but head over there to read it.</p>
<p>I will lift the Galaxie 500 bit for a quote though!</p>
<blockquote><p>“What do you want?” asked the first record company executive who bothered to sit down with Galaxie 500, and began to offer us choices: a new car, our faces on billboards… As he got to the bottom of the list, he suddenly brightened and said: “Oh, I know. You’re in it for the music.” (He must have figured he was in for a bargain.)</p></blockquote>
