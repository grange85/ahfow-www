Later this month Dean Wareham will be releasing a solo single on fab indie [Sonic Cathedral](https://www.soniccathedral.co.uk/) - I think this is his first solo release since the Anestheisa single released between Galaxie 500 and Luna (obviously there are [minor exceptions](/2013/08/07/originals-hey-you-by-pink-floyd-covered-by-dean-wareham/). This has created a minor headache for me in that the Dean Wareham section of the discography had nicely become a repository for Dean's appearances on other folks records. It was never comprehensive but caught, I think, most of his dabbling elsewhere.

While I'm pondering just how I cure my minor headache here are a few of those appearances...
