<p>Isn't It a Pity first saw the light of day on George Harrison's triple album All Things Must Pass in 1970, but it had been kicking around for a while before that. It had been apparently been vetoed by John Lennon during The Beatles' Get Back Sessions, and George may have put it forward as a Beatles track as early as 1966 for Revolver. If you're interested there's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isn%27t_It_a_Pity">a lot more to the Isn't It a Pity story over at Wikipedia</a>!</p>
<p>George recorded two versions for All Things Must Pass, which don't appear to be on YouTube... so here's a demo recorded during The Beatles' Get Back sessions<br />

<p>And here's George (although not sure of the source of this version)<br />

<p>Galaxie 500 covered the song on their second album On Fire:<br />

<p>The band didn't play it live because, according to this 1990 interview in Sounds, because it was "too hard":<br />

<p>I guess things get easier over time as Dean's been playing it a few times of late:</p>
<p>With Britta and Jonathan and Grasshopper of Mercury Rev:<br />
