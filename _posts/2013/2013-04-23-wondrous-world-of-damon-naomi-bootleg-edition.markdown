<p>If while trawling your local shops on Record Store Day you missed out on (or never managed to track down) a copy of Damon & Naomi's "Bootleg edition" of their second album The Wondrous World of Damon & Naomi just to let you know that you don't need to trawl eBay for copies but can head off to <a href="http://damonandnaomi.com/shop/dn-wondrous-world-lp/">Damon & Naomi's web site</a> and order yourself a copy directly from them.</p>
