<p>{% track "14 Auspicious Dreams" %} was released in 1997 on a benefit 7" single for <a href="http://www.terrascope.co.uk/">Ptolemaic Terrascope</a>. The music was written by the late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hopper">Hugh Hopper</a> formerly of Soft Machine, the lyrics were by Naomi Yang. That's what I've learnt from the sleeve and is pretty much all I do know about it. The single also included tracks by The Bevis Frond, Flying Saucer Attack and The Silver Apples</p>
