Awake in a Muddle was recorded by Damon & Naomi and first appeared as the b-side of their<a href="/database/release/the-navigator-awake-in-a-muddle/"> 7" single The Navigator</a>, released on Earworm in 1997. It then appeared on their third album, <a href="/database/release/playback-singers/">Playback Singers</a> the following year. This kicked off a long-term relationship between Damon & Naomi and Ghost.</p>
<p>The song had originated on Japanese band Ghost's second album, Second Time Around in 1992.</p>
