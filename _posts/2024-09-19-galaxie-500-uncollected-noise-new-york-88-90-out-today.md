The lovely double album that mops up (what must be) the last of Galaxie 500's recorded output is out today and, as well as being in a [variety of packages on Bandcamp](https://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/album/uncollected-noise-new-york-88-90) and in your local independent record shop, is likely turning up on your preferred streaming platform - I'm listening now on Spotify while waiting for my proper copy to arrive from Monorail.

The double album collects most of what was previously released on the [Box Set version of Uncollected](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/galaxie-500/releases/uncollected/) with a few tracks that have never before seen an official release.

[The Enduring Simplicity of Galaxie 500](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/arts/music/galaxie-500-uncollected-noise-new-york.html?unlocked_article_code=1.L04.4In6.azQkS8To3Kzx&smid=url-share) is a nice piece in the New York Times - that link should get you past the paywall (as a gift link).

Dean Wareham had a nice hour long chat on [Temporal Cove w/Smilegoth](https://soundcloud.com/user-643553014/temporal-cove-w-smilegoth-dean?) (Soundcloud link).

Naomi has recorded [an interview for Rare Earth on KALX](https://kalx.berkeley.edu/galaxie-500s-naomi-yang-speaks-with-rare-earth/) that will be broadcast on Monday.

[Galaxie 500 unites behind new archival release](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/09/19/arts/galaxie-500-new-archival-release/) in the Boston Globe.
