I've written about this show often so apologies for the rehash, but over time this has become one of my favourite Luna shows. I made the recording on my [SONY D6C Walkman Professional](https://walkman.land/sony/wm-d6c) although the mic was the SONY tie clip mic that came with my [previous Walkman recorder](https://walkman.land/sony/WM-F2) - sadly both recorders have passed away... although [I still have the mic](https://flic.kr/p/2q4LrGb).

Luna were supporting The Velvet Underground on their 1993 reunion and had a day off in London and so slipped in this show at The Borderline, and what a show! I was partly annoyed at the time at the young woman relentlessly hectoring the band and shouting repeatedly for a song they rather cruelly never actually played - but now, after years of listening to this recording I love the _I Want Everything Girl (IWEG)_ - sometimes it's things like this that keep a gig in your memories, and it's worth it for that. It helped I guess that the hectoring, and the band's response, was all done with such good humour.

The Mailing List didn't start until the middle of 1995, and I've never reliably kept a diary, so sadly don't have a record of what I thought of the show at the time, but I know that I have never been disappointed in a Luna show and this one, and their [other show at The Borderline a couple of years later](/2021/05/10/audio-full-show-luna-borderline/), are up there with the very best of them.

Dean however, doesn't agree:

<blockquote>
We have our own show at the Borderline in London. I am tired and have had a bit much Guinness. The show is sloppy and the guitars are out of tune but I don’t think anyone noticed. After the show we go back to the Columbia Hotel and sit in the bar.

This was the second, and last, Luna show I recorded. I found that I couldn't enjoy a gig as much if I was worrying about the recording, so I'd pretty much stopped taping any shows by then, luckily others have carried on making and sharing recordings of their shows, so I have plenty to keep me occupied.

I popped the full show on YouTube a couple of years ago:

Here's my [previous post from fifteen years ago](/2009/09/02/mp3-luna-live-in-london-in-1993/) saying pretty much the same thing and with a link to a zip of mp3s if you prefer that.
