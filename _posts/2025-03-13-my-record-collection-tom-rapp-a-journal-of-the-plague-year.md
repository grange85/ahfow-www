A Journal of the Plague Year was Tom Rapp's first new album in over a quarter of a century and most of it was produced and engineered by Damon and both he and Naomi played on varios bits of the album

Around the time of the first Terrastock, and Tom's reappearance Bob sent me two cassettes of Tom/Pearls Before Swine which was my introduction to him and the start of long love. I do still have the cassettes but bought CDs and the LP rarities comps that EARTH put out a couple of years ago. Such a body of work from someone completely unknown to me before Terrastock I.

This album was released in 1999 a couple of years after that first Terrastock, after Bob had sent me the tapes, and around the time of the _Constructive Melancholy_ compilation all of which had contributed to my love of Tom. It is an exceptional album, Tom still had that gentle voice, his sharp tongue, and his tidy wit, and it felt like he hadn't been away.

Most of the album was recorded at Damon & Naomi's  _Kali Studios_ which I guess is what we can be seen in the Playback Singers CD booklet, with their cat relaxing in it:

Damon recently, behind his Substack paywall, reprinted an interview that he and Masaki Batoh (of Ghost) conducted with Tom in 1998, it had quite a long and lovely preamble and is the sort of thing that [subscribing to the Dada Drummer Almanack](https://dadadrummer.substack.com/subscribe) worthwhile:

<blockquote>
<p>[A]ll of Tomâ€™s songs are touched by a special note of tragedy, something that rarely finds its way into popular music.</p>
<p>Tom Rapp himself is not a tragic figure, however. He is in fact extremely funny. In conversation, the wit that he uses so elegantly in his songs emerges as a hilarious candor, both about himself and others.</p>
</blockquote>

I wrote about [Tom in an obituary of sorts](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2018/02/12/tom-rapp-1947-2018/) for this website when he sadly passed away in 2018.

At the end of the album is a short _hidden_ track which is Tom relating some classic 60s drugs stories from the stage at Terrastock II in April 1998 ... "he came in one day and he said 'Man you've got to try this, they put dogs to sleep with it.'"
