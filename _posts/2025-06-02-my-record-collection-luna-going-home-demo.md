This is a flexidisc given away with issue 48 of US music paper 'The Bob' in "Summertime 1994" and includes a demo of Luna's {% ahfowtrack "Going Home" %} on one side and tracks by the (very excellent) The Dentists, and Thee Headcoats (one of Wild Billy Childish's very many projects).

I wrote about this single in an [Artefacts post](/2019/07/19/artefacts-008-luna-going-home-demo-flexi/) six years ago... so the first bit of this will be a cut and paste from that:

<blockquote>
<p>This demo version of Luna’s Going Home was released on a flexidisc given away with issue 48 of The Bob magazine.</p>
<p>To be honest I’m not too sure how this came into my possession, the stickers suggest I bought it at a Notting Hill Gate Record & Tape Exchange for £1.50 (there’s a cheaper price stuck to the back of the disc) - but I don’t remember doing that, although I bought a lot of stuff from the exchanges so it’s perfectly possible. Maybe I was sent it by another fan (thanks if I did that and it was you) or I bought it on eBay or Discogs (but can’t find any evidence of that).</p>

So while the single's provenance is a little uncertain - I do also have a copy of the issue of The Bob that it came with, but that arrived at a different time - sent to me by Rob in 2012 - and it has a Luna on the front - I've [scanned the cover, and the Luna interview into a PDF](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/docs/1994-the-bob-luna.pdf). The issue dates from the release of Bewitched (there is also an ad for the album):

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Bob:</strong> Do you have any idea how the new album Bewitched is doing sales wise?</p>
<p><strong>Dean:</strong> Better than the last one, which shouldn't be too difficult. Probably around 30,000 in the US, and a thousand in England [...] England's a country where you're better off on an indie label, unless you're big. You get a lot of atitude fron the British journalists simply for being on a major [...] I don't think they have a clue what it's like here in the States. Indie labels over there do really well. Some of them are rich with cash, which is great. But what's the big deal anyway?</p>
</blockquote>

Well I guess Dean figured out what the "big deal" was since all the rest of Luna's albums up to and including Romantica were released on Beggars Banquet in the UK - one of those cash-rich indies!

If you're unfamiliar with The Dentists please check them out - a couple of years back Precious Recordings released their 1987 Janice Long session on a 10" (that I managed to miss out on) - but [you can listen to (and download) on Bandcamp](https://preciousrecordingsoflondon.bandcamp.com/album/pre-029-the-dentists-janice-long-session-020487).
