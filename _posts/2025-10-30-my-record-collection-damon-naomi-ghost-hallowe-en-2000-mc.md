This is a recording of Damon & Naomi with Ghost from Hallowe'en 2000 that someone (possibly Bob) sent me way back when we used to share cassettes rather than CDs! The sleeve is a photocopy of the appropriately seasonal poster from the show.

I was never a particularly good tape trader, and as soon as I could digitised all my cassettes and disposed of a lot of them. This one likely survived because of the sleeve.

It's a nice recording of Damon & Naomi playing with Ghost-ly augmentations - there are some lovely wind additions, most notably during Eye of The Storm.

The left-over space at the end of the side 2 is filled with [four and a half songs of Luna live in Chicago in April 2000](/database/luna/shows/luna-2000-04-04-metro-chicago-il-usa/).
