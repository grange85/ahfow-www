This is the fourth and final appearance of Luna's Penthouse and is a cassette copy that I bought (online) from [Sound it Out Records](https://sounditoutrecords.co.uk/) back in 2013 at the same time that I bought the [cassette copy of Lunapark](/2025/01/02/my-record-collection-luna-lunapark-elektra-cassette//2025/01/02/my-record-collection-luna-lunapark-elektra-cassette/).

Since this is the last appearance it's probably time to look at the tracklisting, not it any way in-depth just with some little snippets that pop into my head... I can't guarantee that these are actually all correct or true.

 - **Chinatown** was written "at least partially" about Terry Tolkin the A&R man who signed the band to Elektra and released Dean and Luna tracks on his own No.6 Records. 
<blockquote>
He enjoyed his new life. He drank and partied and showed up late to work most days, or worked from home. His new life inspired the lyrics I wrote for "Chinatown".
</blockquote>

 - **Sideshow by the Seashore** was a venue in Coney Island - the song contains Justin playing a theremin.
 - **Moon Palace** is named after a Paul Auster book and also references "Christopher Boyce" who was The Falcon in the film _The Falcon and the Snowman_.
 - **Double Feature**
 - **23 Minutes in Brussels** is probably Luna's most popular song - it consistently topped the annual survey, and a lyric was used as the title of their farewell tour rockumentary, and was played over the end credits. They first played it live in late 1994 although it changed quite a lot before it reached Penthouse. There's an mp3 on the [post about the 23 Minutes single](/2025/03/03/my-record-collection-luna-hedgehog-23-minutes-in-brussels-7/).
 - **Lost in Space** opens side two of he LP although Dean admitted in the [Life of the Record podcast](https://lifeoftherecord.com/luna-notes) that they "didn’t plan this as side one and side two because this is the CD era, the compact disc era. We just thought of it as sequencing the ten songs."
