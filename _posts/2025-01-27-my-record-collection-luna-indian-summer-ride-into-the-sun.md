This is the 7" single of Luna's cover of Indian Summer that was only released in this format on Australian indie Summershine in 1993.

The single comes in a generic card Summershine sleeve that has a sticker added proudly, but plainly, declaring what it is.

Another single that I can't remember how I came by. I suspect I bought it on eBay but can't find any evidence. It feels like it has been in my collection a while though.

Every time I listen to this version of Indian Summer it transports me back to seeing Luna back in the early 90s. Oddly, since it's a cover, it is the song that has the greatest emotional impact on me. They played it the very first time I saw them back in 1992, and they played it at pretty much every other show I was at... I'd always say that a Luna show doesn't feel finished until Indian Summer and I still believe that... even if they're not ending with it these days.

Ride Into The Sun was recorded without the coda that they started adding to their live performances a few years later. I must admit that I prefer it without that extra bit.
