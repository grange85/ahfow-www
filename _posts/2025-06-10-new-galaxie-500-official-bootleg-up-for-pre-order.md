Galaxie 500 have announced the official release of a long-bootlegged live recording. The show was recorded at CBGB's on 13th December 1988 and is being released in multiple formats by Silver Current, who released the Uncollected Noise New York album last year.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/sleeves/g500-cbgb-13th-december-1988.jpg" "Galaxie 500 - CBGB - 13th December 1988" %}

The album is titled "CBGB 12.13.88"&dagger; and is available to pre-order now with a release scheduled for 8th August.

<blockquote>
Captured here in a raw but inspired board mix by Kramer and restored and mastered from the analog source by Alan Douches at West West Side Music, CBGB 12.13.88 is a live snapshot of a Galaxie fully formed, punctuating the end of their first chapter while poised to step into their next with On Fire the following year.

_&dagger; that chosen date format will never get posted on my web site without me saying that it makes no sense to have a date format in such an illogical and misleading form - you either go from largest unit (Y) to smallest unit (D), so 88.12.13 or from smallest unit (D) to largest unit (Y). so 13.12.88 - whatever you do you NEVER should go from the medium sized unit (M) DOWN to the smallest unit (D) and then BACK UP to the largest unit (Y) so 12.13.88 is just silly. Sorry - off my high horse now!_
