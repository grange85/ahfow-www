Damon & Naomi's show at [Fever in Tokyo on the 5th November](/database/damon-and-naomi/shows/damon-and-naomi-2024-11-05-fever-shindaita-bldg-setagaya-tokyo-japan/) will be live streamed - and available to view for a week after the show. The stream will be through the Zaiko platform and will cost &yen;2500 (which Google tells me is about &pound;12.50 and about $16.30).

The stream will also include the support set from the very excellent Sugar Plant and will start at 19:30 Tokyo time which is so [timeanddate.com informs me](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2024&month=11&day=5&hour=10&min=30&sec=0&p1=248&p2=1327&p3=43&p4=137&p5=240&p6=22&p7=141&iv=1800):

I'm sure you can work out the time wherever you are! 

Tickets go on sale on the 29th October at 17:00 Tokyo time (I'll let you do the arithemtic on that one) - [this might be the ticket link ](https://fever.zaiko.io/item/367311) (_if not I'll update it when I know the correct one_).

See you there!
