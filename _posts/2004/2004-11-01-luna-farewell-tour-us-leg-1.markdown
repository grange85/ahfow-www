<p>On Saturday night Luna kicked of the first US leg of their farewell tour at Maxwells in Hoboken, NJ - by all accounts a good show was put on, although it took a while for the band to really get in the groove - they opened with Season of the Witch and closed with (surprise, surprise) Indian Summer - in between was a wealth of Luna new and old - the full setlist can be seen here...
