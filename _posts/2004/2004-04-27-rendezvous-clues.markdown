<p>Britta left a few tantalising hints about the forthcoming Luna album on the Galaxie 500 mailing list."I think the main difference between Romantica and Rendezvous is that we recorded it all in one room together and kept most of the live bass and guitar performances so it definitely has that live sound - less  produced....warmer...."Additionally Sean gets to exercise his vocal talents on a couple of numbers.Rendezvous is due for release on Jetset in the late summer. source: The Galaxie 500 mailing list - http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/mailingl.php</p>
