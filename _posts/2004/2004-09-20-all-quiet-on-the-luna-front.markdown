<p>Still no news of the promised tour, and a scout round the ticket agency websites (pollstar, ticketweb, ticketmaster etc.) has revealed nothing. The release date for Rendezvous is still reported on the Jetset website as 26 October (that's just over a month away).The Japanese release of Rendezvous may or may not be released earlier than that, it will probably have an extra track and that extra track will possibly be called "Eyes Get In Your Smoke".More REAL news as soon as I have any!</p>
