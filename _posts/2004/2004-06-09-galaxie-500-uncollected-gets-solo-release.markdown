Lifted wholesale from Rykodisc.com...For years the only way fans could get their hands on the Uncollected Galaxie 500 rarities disc was to buy the 4 CD Galaxie 500 Box Set. Since the Box has been unavailable for many years it has become an expensive collector's item, selling for over $100 online. Now Rykodisc is pleased to announce the release of this amazing disc as a stand-alone release at last! Uncollected features 14 tracks, opening with a cover of the Rutles "Cheese & Onions" and ending with a cover of the Beatles' "Rain" (in a medley with "Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste"). In between you'll find songs from their earliest recording session in 1987 through their final session in June of 1990 for "This Is Our Music". Includes new artwork designed by Galaxie's own Naomi Yang. Look for the Galaxie 500 DVD Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste on Ryko-distributed Plexifilm in late July. The album will be available on August 3rd.
