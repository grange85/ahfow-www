<p>Less news and more a reminder. The Galaxie 500 double DVD will be released in June (not May as reported earlier) by Plexifilms (http://www.plexifilm.com/). It will include live footage, interviews, videos and, on the second disc, two complete live "bootleg" shows.Hmmmm...can't wait.source: http://www.damonandnaomi.com</p>
