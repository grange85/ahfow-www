<p>A couple of Luna related items have turned up on eBay which some of the musicians out their might find interesting (or, I guess anyone who's planning on building The Luna Museum, or for the walls of the Indie-Rock-Cafe!).</p>
<p>Dean Wareham's Coral Pink Stratocaster http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3768635279<br/>and<br/>The VERY fuzz pedal that Dean used on "Luna Live" - go listen to Bonnie and Clyde off that album if you want to hear it in action!http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3768624248</p>
