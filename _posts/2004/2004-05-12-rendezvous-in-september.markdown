Luna's next album, Rendezvous, is completed and has been slated for a September release on Jetset Records. There are no plans to tour until then.All old news I'll admit, but as it's been officially pilfered from fuzzywuzzy I thought it warranted a rehash. More details, including a tracklisting can be found there (and on the album's discography entry here!).
