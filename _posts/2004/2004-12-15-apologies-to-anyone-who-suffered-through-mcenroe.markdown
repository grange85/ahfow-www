<p>OK, it seems fuzzywuzzy (and by association ME) were fed duff info and LUNA were not on McEnroe last night (Tuesday) but some bellydancers were. It may be that Luna's performance of Malibu Love Nest will show up tonight but it is recommended that you tape the show so you can FF through the bad bits and not feel like a chuunk of your life has been wasted by watching it and NOT seeing Luna. Sorry.</p>
