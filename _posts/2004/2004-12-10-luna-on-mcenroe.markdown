<p>Luna appeared on Thursday's edition of CNBC's soon to be axed McEnroe show. They played "Speedbumps" and finished the show off with a version of the Velvet Underground's "Sweet Jane" during which they were joined by the former tennis star who has always fancied himself a bit of a rock n roller.Luna's drummer, for one night only, was Matt Johnson who was sitting in while Lee was out of town.I understand that the show gets repeated, possibly over the weekend so you may still have a chance to catch it. Otherwise I'll try and get a copy streamed from this very site if I can lay my hands on a copy (and if bandwidth allows).</p>
