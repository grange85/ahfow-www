Plexifilm will be giving away a 7" single with the new Galaxie 500 double DVD if you pre-order it from their website. The single features live versions of Snowstorm and Pictures and is limited to just 500 copies. So get yourself off to the Plexifilm web site  - [http://plexifilm.com/store/galaxie/](https://web.archive.org/web/20040516+/http://plexifilm.com/store/galaxie/) and pre-order if you want this special package to be even more special (and you'll get it before it reaches the shops)
