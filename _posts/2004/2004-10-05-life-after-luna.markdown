<p>Britta Phillips dropped a few tantalising hints as to what was to come after Luna finally bow out in spring of next year. In a post on The Galaxie 500 Mailing List the bass player hinted at "A project with [former Spacemen 3 member] Sonic Boom" and "another Dean & Britta album". Still no news of what Lee and Sean might be up to next.source: The Galaxie 500 Mailing List - http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/mailingl.php</p>
