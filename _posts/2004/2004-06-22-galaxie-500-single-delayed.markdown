<p>Plexifilm have pointed out that production delays have meant that the promo 7" single that was being issued with pre-orders of "Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste" - the Galaxie 500 DVD - was not ready in time. Here is Plexifilm's statement...Due to a production delay, the Galaxie 500 limited edition 7" is not included with your DVD.  The record will be shipped separately in 2-3 weeks.  We apologize for this inconvenience.  If you have any questions, please e-mail us at merchandise@musictoday.comsource: Plexifilm</p>
