This lifted from the D&N email newsletter - We've always appreciated the note above the New Yorker magazine's club listings, that says, "Musicians and nightclub proprietors live complicated lives; it's advisable to call ahead . . . "It seems the promoter for our upcoming Philadelphia show has, according to different accounts of the same events, "been overwhelmed of late," "gone on tour with some band," or simply "disappeared", leaving various Philadelphia venues he works with doublebooked, or otherwise confused about their schedules.Our show in Philly cannot, as a result, take place at the time and place announced; and given the late notice, we've decided to cancel rather than move the venue and/or date. Our apologies!Next week's shows in Boston, Brooklyn, and New York will all take place as planned. Anyone who drives to one from Philadelphia, show us your NJ turnpike ticket and we'll buy you a drink. Have a happy Valentine's Day.
