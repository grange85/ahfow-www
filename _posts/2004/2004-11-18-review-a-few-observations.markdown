<p>LUNA w/ Apostles of Hustle $14.00<br />Tuesday, November 09, 2004<br />Beachland Ballroom, Cleveland OH<br />A few observations from the Beachland Ballroom show<br />* Once the opening band had cleared their equipment from the stage, Lee was setting up sticks of incense in various spots on the stage and around his drum kit.<br />* First time hearing Malibu Love Nest sung live with lyrics.<br />* A great Black Postcards extended jam.  It's a shame that the album version ends when it does, the extended jam really makes a great song even better.<br />* After Broken Chair, an unusual crowd silence prompted Britta to comment "...just like Japan."  This would be the only time she would say anything during the show.<br />* Overall, the sound was very good.  However, the bass seemed a bit heavy when you would move towards the middle of the room towards the soundboard.<br />* Microphones set up in front of the soundboard indicating the possibility of a live record?<br />* Towards the end of the main set, Dean said "a moment of silence for our dead government";.  Keeping in mind that Ohio was very influential in the Presidential election held a week earlier, it sparked a minor debate of sorts among the crowd.<br />* Friendly Advice, Tugboat and Indian Summer weren't on the setlist.  The three additional songs extended the lone encore into three encores.<br />* Tugboat seemed to confuse the non-Luna loyal.  Overheard a few people asking each other what song they were playing.<br />* Initially, the crowd was slow to warm up to the band, but towards the latter part of the night the crowd started to react with much enthusiasm.</p>
