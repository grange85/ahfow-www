<p>Sorry that this months track is a bit late (again); Sorry that I'm raiding a show I've used before; Sorry it's been so long since the last D&N TOTM. <br />This recording is from the show in London in May 2001. Damon & Naomi are accompanied by Kurihara on guitar. "This Car Climbed Mt. Washington" has been top of the "Favourite Damon & Naomi Track" category for nine consecutive surveys.</p>
