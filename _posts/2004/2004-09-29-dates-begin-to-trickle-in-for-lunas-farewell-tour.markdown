<p>Luna's extended farewell tour is finally beginning to take shape. After a few dates in Japan they return to the US and then plan to tour Europe and play some more US dates in early 2005. I will post any dates I hear of as soon as I hear of them so keep an eye on this site  (http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/index.php?news=yes).Other places to keep an eye on are Fuzzywuzzy (obviously - http://www.fuzzywuzzy.com) and the ticket agent sites like Ticketweb, Ticketmaster and Pollstar</p>
