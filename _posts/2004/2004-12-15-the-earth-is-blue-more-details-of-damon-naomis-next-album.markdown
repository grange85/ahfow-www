<p>I've just added a full tracklisting and credits for Damon & Naomi's The Earth is Blue which will be released on Valentine's day of 2005. It includes amongst a bunch of lovely originals a gorgeous rendition of George Harrison's "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". The album will be released on Damon & Naomi's own 20/20/20 label.http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/index.php?album_id=197</p>
