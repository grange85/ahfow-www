<p>Dean has some solo material newly available. Back in May he was in Paris to record a couple of tracks with Maggie Cheung for her (and Oliver Assayas') new film Clean (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388838/). French label Naive have just put out the soundtrack which features two tracks with Dean (instruments) and Maggie Cheung (voice) (plus Britta on bass) as well as contributions from David Roback, Tricky and Brian Eno - which all adds up to a worthwhile purchase in my book.</p>
