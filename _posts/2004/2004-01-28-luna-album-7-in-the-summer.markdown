<p>Luna's information mailing list kicked into life this week with news that their seventh album was likely to be released in "late spring or early summer". The album is being recorded in Brooklyn with Bryce Goggin (Pavement, Lemonheads) producing. Recording should be finished next month and the album, tentatively titled "Rendezvous" will be released on Jetset. Tracks will include "Malibu Love Nest", "Eyes Get In Your Smoke", "Speedbumps", "Rainbow Babe" and "Broken Chair" - a number of which have been previewed at recent shows.Britta Phillips, posting on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List, suggested that it was unlikely the band would be touring before the release of the album.Sources: Luna mailing list  (http://www.fuzzywuzzy.com/docs/mailing.html)Galaxie 500 mailing list (http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/mailing-list/)</p>
