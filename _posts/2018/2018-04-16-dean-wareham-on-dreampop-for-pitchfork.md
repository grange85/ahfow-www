<p class="lead">Dean Wareham has written a Galaxie 500 centred introduction to Dream Pop for Pitchfork's <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-30-best-dream-pop-albums/">The 30 Best Dream Pop Albums</a></p>

<blockquote>Galaxie 500 were called a lot of things. New York magazine called us “plain soporific.” A VJ at MTV England told us we were “wimpy.” Later, we were dubbed “slowcore,” along with bands like Low and Codeine who played a lot slower (and in a more controlled fashion) than we did. “Proto-shoegaze” was another, but I know we were not shoegaze; those bands buried their vocals and the guitarists strummed chords through a whole slew of effects pedals or a multi-effects processor. [&hellip;] Shoegaze bands are more of an assault, a wall of sound, while there is more empty space in dream pop—allowing more room for melody and counter-melody, whether on vocals, keyboards, or guitars.</blockquote>

<p>In the article Galaxie 500's On Fire rolls in at No.4 and writer Jenn Pelly suggests that &hellip;</p>
<blockquote>as in all great dream pop, these impressionistic elements congeal into a single atomic sound, as if the instruments have eclipsed one another, moving with the crawl of a cloud.</blockquote>

<p>&hellip; and Today shows up at 16 and Quinn Moreland points out that&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>No matter how high Damon Krukowski’s primal, jazz-inspired drums, Dean Wareham’s psychedelic guitar ramblings, and Naomi Yang’s robust basslines soar, their playing always returns to Earth. Their heads, however, stay in the clouds&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>Damon tweeted that back in the day he simply thought of Galaxie 500 as "punk rock" and now aspires to get filed under 'acid folk'!</p>
