<p class="lead">Over the course of a week I saw Luna four times in four different cities, here is the first of my word-sketches of those four shows.</p>
<p>For the London show I bunked off work early, met the boy and headed to the Academy for Luna's souncheck - it was a treat, you can read a little and <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2018/09/08/luna-soundcheck-galaxie-500-pictures/">watch a video of the soundcheck on Everything's Swirling</a>.</p>
<p>After soundcheck it was off to Euphorium for the pre-show meet-up which was well attended and nice to catch up with the Luna-tics, we then headed off for the show to catch great support slots by Gaygirl and Fear of Men - some top DJ-work from Sonic Cathedral and find that Luna were, unsurprisingly, in top-form.</p>

<div class="col-md-6 pull-left"><figure class="aligncenter"><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/44490095432/in/album-72157671016607437/" title="Fear of Men"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1872/44490095432_455bac9d81_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Fear of Men"></a><figcaption>Fear of Men at Islington Academy</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Academy isn't a particularly nice venue (although the boy found a comfy seat on the mezzanine) but the sound was good, the audience were enthusuastic and the band in good spirits.</p>
<p>Nice surprise was hearing that {% track "Math Wiz" %} was getting an outing on this tour - The Days of Our Nights has always been very under-represented in Luna live shows but this and {% track "Superfreaky Memories" %} have been added to the repertoire for this tour (although I wasn't lucky enough to hear the latter).</p>
<p>Show over we were unceremoniusly herded out of the venue and decamped to a nearby pub for a little post-show gathering.</p>
<p>A nice start to my Luna tour and nice to see so many familiar faces, and to meet a couple of new ones.</p>
