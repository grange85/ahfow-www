<p class="lead">Last month <a href="http://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2017/12/an-interview-with-andy-aldridge.html">Jenell from It's Psychedelic Baby and myself sat down for a chat</a> about all things A Head Full of Wishes. As much as I love to talk about AHFoW it did seem rather odd the idea of me being interesting enough to be interviewed but Jenell was a good interviewer and was happy to let me ramble on.</p>

<blockquote>I finally got the nerve to talk to Dean after the show at LA2 in October 1997. He was really nice, he signed my ticket, and I must have given him my phone number because a few days later I got home from work to find a message from him on my answerphone. Obviously not being there to take the call was the best thing that could have happened, we were both spared an awkward conversation and I have kept that recording of Dean Wareham ringing me up. It’s one of my favourite bits of memorabilia!

<blockquote>The first time I was brave enough to talk to Naomi about Galaxie 500 was after their Terrastock London performance in 1999, and even then I left most of the talking to another fan who didn’t have the anxieties I had. But over the years things became much more relaxed<footer><a href="http://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2017/12/an-interview-with-andy-aldridge.html">An Interview With Andy Aldridge</a></footer></blockquote>

<p>So if the thought of me wittering on at length about web sites, gigs and hobnobbing with heroes then head over to <a href="http://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2017/12/an-interview-with-andy-aldridge.html">It's Psychedelic Baby for the full interview</a> - I do of course get to mention Mot&ouml;rhead!</p>
