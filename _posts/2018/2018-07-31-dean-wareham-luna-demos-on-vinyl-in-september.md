<p class="lead">After the split of Galaxie 500 in 1991 Dean Wareham recorded a number of demos at Wharton Tiers' Fun City Studios in New York City and for the first time these tracks have been collected together for a limited edition vinyl only release.</p>

<p>The tracks were accompanied by drummer Jimmy Chambers (Mercury Rev) and, on {% ahfowtrack "I Can't Wait" %} by Hamish Kilgour of the Clean. Later versions of the songs appear on Luna's Lunapark album.</p>

<p>Some of the tracks have seen the light of day on various releases over the years but now for the first time they have been collected together for a vinyl release on Lux Records. Also included is the version of {% ahfowtrack "Smile" %} that Dean recorded with Kramer for the compilation album <a href="/database/dean-and-britta/dean-wareham-releases/dean-wareham-what-else-do-you-do/">What Else Do You Do?</a>.</p>

<p>The album will be limited 600 numbered copies - 200 on clear vinyl and 400 on black vinyl and will be available from <a href="https://www.omnianmusicgroup.com/collections/captured-tracks">Captured Tracks in the US</a>; <a href="https://www.normanrecords.com/records/171848-dean-wareham-luna-demos">Norman Records in the UK</a> and from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lux-Records-146155128817460/">Lux Records in Portugal</a>. Currently only Norman seem to have the record available for pre-order.</p>

<p>Luna Demos will be released on 3rd September at <a href="/database/luna/shows/2018/2018-09-03-luna-salao-brazil-coimbra-portugal/">Luna's show in Coimbra, Portugal</a>.</p>
