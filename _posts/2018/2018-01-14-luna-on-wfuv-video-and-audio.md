This week Luna kicked off the next US leg of their ongoing 'reunion' (when does it stop being that?) and to coincide WFUV have <a href="http://www.wfuv.org/content/luna-2018">broadcast the session that the band recorded</a> when they were in NYC on the last leg back in November.
The set included the first public outing of their cover of Sweetness by Yes.

You can see video of them playing <a href="https://www.vuhaus.com/videos/luna-hey-sister">Hey Sister</a> and <a href="https://www.vuhaus.com/videos/luna-gtx3">GTX3</a> from the session over on VUHAUS.

Other stuff turning up include:

A good <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/dean-wareham-on-knowing-when-to-take-a-break/">Q&A with Dean over at The Creative Independent</a>

<blockquote>When you break up with someone you have to convince yourself that it’s really intolerable and really awful. That’s what you must convince yourself of in order to leave—you’re building that story in your mind—so it’s like watching myself do that. Looking back, maybe we should have just taken a break.<footer><a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/dean-wareham-on-knowing-when-to-take-a-break/">Dean Wareham on knowing when to take a break</a> - The Creative Independent</footer></blockquote>

The <a href="https://radiomilwaukee.org/discover-music/studio-milwaukee/listen-luna-studio-milwaukee/">session they did for 88Nine Radio Milwaulkee</a> is also online - audio of the whole session and video of 23 Minutes in Brussels.

On 23rd January <a href="http://kexp.org/events/instudio">Luna will be doing a live session for KEXP</a> - the web site says its open to the public so you should be able to sign-up for tickets somewhere if you're in the neighbourhood.
