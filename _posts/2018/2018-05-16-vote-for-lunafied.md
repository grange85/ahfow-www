<p class="lead">Run Out Groove Records has a monthly poll which allows us to choose an album that they will then press in a limited run. For May's vote they are throwing Luna's Lunafied into the ring. <a href="http://runoutgroovevinyl.com/lunafied.html">Head over to Run Out Groove to vote</a> to get a double LP release of some of the finest covers ever recorded!</p>

<p><a href="/database/luna/releases/luna-lunafied-luna-covers/">Lunafied</a> has until now only been available as a digital only release put out by Rhino in 2006 and, in a different form, as the bonus disc with the <a href="/database/luna/releases/luna-best-of-luna/#beggars-banquet-cd">UK edition of Best of Luna</a>. The proposed Run Out Groove copy will include all the tracks from both versions in a double album. Now, that has to be worth your vote!</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
 <li>If voted to win, ROG will release this brand new collection that includes all cover songs, many of which have never been released on vinyl.</li>
 <li>Includes many out of print and rare tracks originally released as singles outside the U.S., collected for the first time on a full length record.</li>
 <li>Will be sourced from the original masters with lacquers cut at Sam Phillips Recording Studio</li>
