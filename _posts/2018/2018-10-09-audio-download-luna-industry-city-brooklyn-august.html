<p class="lead">The always excellent NYCTaper has posted a splendid recording of <a href="http://www.nyctaper.com/2018/10/luna-august-24-2018-industry-city-brooklyn/">Luna at Industry City in Brooklyn</a> in August.</p>

<blockquote>In the evolving story of Luna v2.0, the band continues to entertain in new ways. While last year it was the eclectic and meticulously curated covers album A Sentimental Education, this year’s tour seems to be an exercise in finding the deep cuts that haven’t been performed in more a decade. Its been three years now and as we’ve chronicled umpteen shows, but at this Industry City show in August we saw Luna perform four songs for the first time — “Math Wiz”, “I Can’t Wait”, “Broken Chair” and the Galaxie 500 number “Strange”.
