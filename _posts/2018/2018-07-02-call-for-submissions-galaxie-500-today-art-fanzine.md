<p class="lead">In a few months Galaxie 500's Today will be 30 years old &endash; I thought it might be nice to do a follow-up to the fanzine - although I'd like this one to be less about memories and reminiscences and more of a creative art project.</p>

<p>I was thinking of nine "pieces" titled for, and/or inspired by, each of the tracks - and by pieces I was thinking...</p>

<ul>
<li>painting/drawing/print</li>
<li>photography</li>
<li>fiction</li>
<li>poetry</li>
<li>comics</li>
<li>something else I haven't thought of</li>
</ul>

<p>There may also be an audio supplement - most likely as a limited run cassette release.</p>

<p>The plan is for something hand-made in a very small run - I haven't figured out _exactly_ what "hand-made" means - but I hope to have a beautiful "artifact" at the end of this.</p>

<p>If you'd like to be involved drop me a line <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/about/">via any of the usual channels</a> and let me know what you're thinking and what song you'd like to work with. There'll be no payment (because I expect it'll lose money) but each contibutor will obviously get a copy, and my undying thanks & appreciation!</p>

<p>Of course you can all recite the <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/galaxie-500/releases/galaxie-500-today/">track listing of Today</a> - but in case you need a reminder...</p>

<ul>
<li>Flowers <em>reserved</em></li>
<li>Pictures</li>
<li>Parking Lot</li>
<li>Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste</li>
<li>Temperature's Rising</li>
<li>Oblivious</li>
<li>It's Getting Late</li>
<li>Instrumental</li>
<li>Tugboat</li>
</ul>
