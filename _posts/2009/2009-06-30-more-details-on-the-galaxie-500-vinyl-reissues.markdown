<p>The last post was hastily chucked together before work yesterday so here's a bit more detail on the Galaxie 500 vinyl resissues. The vinly is described as being "Super Deluxe" although I haven't managed to identify what this entails but the More Sad Hits reissue was very lovely so I have no reason to believe that these will be any different. I'll try and track down the technical details for trhe audiophiles out there!</p>

<p><strong>Update: The technical details...</strong></p>
<p>Videos are 480x320 mp4 files, and are compatible with iPods and iPhones.</p>
<p>Vinyl editions are remastered by Alan Douches and Kramer at West West Side Music, cut by Kevin Gray at AcousTech, pressed to virgin vinyl at RTI, and packaged in old-fashioned tip-on style jackets at Stoughton. T-shirts are Fruit of the Loom. In the 80s, that's all there was.</p>
