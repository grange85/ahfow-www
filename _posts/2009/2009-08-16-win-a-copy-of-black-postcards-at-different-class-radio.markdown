<p>I just got an email from Adrian at London's <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.differentclassradio.co.uk">Different Class Radio</span> to tell me that in his latest show he's giving away a copy of Black Postcards. You can listen to the show (and it is well worth listening to) <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.differentclassradio.co.uk/?page_id=351">over at the website</span> and the competition shouldn't be too challenging for any of you.</p>
