<p>The 15th A Head Full of Wishes survey has just kicked off. <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/surveyform">Head over to cast your vote</span> for favourite albums and tracks by Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon & Naomi and Dean & Britta.</p>
<p>I have no incentives to get people to vote this year so you'll all have to do it for the love of the numbers.</p>
<p>If you feel the need for inspiration you can <a href="http://olddb.fullofwishes.co.uk/survey/view/2008">check out the previous surveys</a>.</p>
<p>It would be nice to beat last years 97 responses.</p>
