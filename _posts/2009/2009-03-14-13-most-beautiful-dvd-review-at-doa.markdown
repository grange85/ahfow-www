<p><a href="http://www.adequacy.net/2009/03/flipsides-otherwise-fao-16/">Delusions of Adequacy</a> has the first review of the 13 Most Beaautiful DVD that I've come across - reassuring to know that, despite the delays Amazon keep notifying me of, that the DVD does exist! The review serves to whet my appetite even more...</p>
<blockquote><p>In less capable hands this a venture that could have only found favour amongst chin-stroking ‘art-installation’ circles and just frustrated music-lovers.  But the fact that 13 Most Beautiful… resolutely welcomes repeated viewing and listening confirms that it is a treasure, not a chore. </p></blockquote>
