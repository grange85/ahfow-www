<p>Dean & Britta are taking 13 Most Beautiful back down under in 2010 as well as playing the <a href="/2009/11/24/13-most-beautiful-at-the-sydney-opera-house-in-february/">previously mentioned show at the Sydney Opera House</a>, they will also be <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.womadelaide.com.au/program/deanandbritta.html">playing three shows in Adelaide as part of WOMADelaide</span> (two 13 Most Beautiful shows and a regular Dean & Britta show), two shows at <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.perthfestival.com.au/Events/music/13-most-beautiful-andy-warhol/">The Perth International Arts Festival</span> and making a trip to <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.nzfestival.nzpost.co.nz/music/13-most-beautiful">Wellington to play as part of the New Zealand International Festival</span>.</p>
<p>While in Wellington it would also be worth checking out the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.nzfestival.nzpost.co.nz/talks-and-forums/13-most-beautiful-art-talk">free event where Dean & Britta "talk about creating 13 Most Beautiful"</span></p>
