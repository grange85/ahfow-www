<p>Dean & Britta are taking 13 Most Beautiful back down under in 2010 as well as playing the <a href="/2009/11/24/13-most-beautiful-at-the-sydney-opera-house-in-february/">previously mentioned show at the Sydney Opera House</a>, they will also be playing three shows in Adelaide as part of WOMADelaide (two 13 Most Beautiful shows and a regular Dean & Britta show), two shows at The Perth International Arts Festival and making a trip to Wellington to play as part of the New Zealand International Festival.</p>
<p>While in Wellington it would also be worth checking out the free event where Dean & Britta "talk about creating 13 Most Beautiful"</p>
