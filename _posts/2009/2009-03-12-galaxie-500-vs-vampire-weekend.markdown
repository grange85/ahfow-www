<p>Crawdaddy compares Galaxie 500 with a more recent bunch of Ivy League graduates...</p>
<blockquote><p>When Wareham sings: “I don’t wanna stay at your party; I don’t wanna talk to your friends,” you believe him, because of the sighs of feedback and the secret code-like way he tells you what he does want: “I just wanna be your tugboat captain.” When Koenig sings, “Don’t you wanna get outta Cape Cod tonight,” it’s in the midst of a social registry name-checking of the different strata of seasonal communities, plus a dig at a rival school and a lobster bake interlude.</p></blockquote>
