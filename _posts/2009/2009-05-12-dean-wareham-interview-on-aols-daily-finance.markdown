<p>AOL's <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2009/05/11/dean-wareham-qanda-a-life-in-rock-is-still-fun-despite-hu/">Daily Finance web site has an interview with Dean Wareham</a> about Black Postcards with, unsurprisingly, a more "business" angle than most interviews</p>
<blockquote><p>Isn't this the nature of capitalism -- deepening cycles of boom and bust? But the compact-disc business is faltering because of changes in technology; that can't be stopped.</p></blockquote>
