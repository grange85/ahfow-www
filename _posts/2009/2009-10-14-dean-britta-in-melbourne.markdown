<p>Dean & Britta are currently in Melbourne, Australia to perform 13 Most Beautiful as part of the Melbourne Arts Festival.

<p>Also on Saturday they'll be guesting at an instore appearance by Sand Pebbles at <a href="http://www.purepop.com.au/IndexFrameset.html">Pure Pop Records</a>... actually probably an outside-instore as it seems to be in their "world famous Pure Pop Courtyard" - sounds like a must if you're in the vicinity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/sandpebbles">Sand Pebbles</a> A Thousand Wild Flowers was the first non-Dean & Britta release on <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/shop.htm">Double Feature Records</a>.</p>
