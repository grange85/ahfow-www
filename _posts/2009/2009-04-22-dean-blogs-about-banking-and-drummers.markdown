<p>Over at deanandbritta.com <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=306">Dean has just posted to the blog</a> hinting (but not telling) at which bank to hang out at if you want to meet celebrities...</p>
<blockquote><p>I walked out in a bit of a huff, and who should I run into by the ATM machines but comedian <a href="http://www.toddbarry.com/">Todd Barry</a>. We chatted for a bit about our summer plans [...] I told Todd about my banking troubles.<br/><br />
"You need to talk to the assistant manager," he said. "She can take care of that."<br/><br />
[...] Just then in walks Sean Eden (he has an account at the same branch).</p></blockquote>
<p>The meat of the post however, was to announce the departure of Anthony LaMarca from the Dean & Britta touring band (off to join <a href="http://www.ilovestvincent.com/">St Vincent</a>'s band) and to fill us in on who'll be taking over for the forthcoming shows...</p>
<blockquote><p>we have a couple of people lined up to take Anthony’s place on the drum throne. Jason Lawrence (of the Caledonia Mission) will play our shows June 4-5-6, where we’ll be playing Dean & Britta songs and a bunch by Galaxie 500 too. And Lee Waters (who has played with Essex Green and Camera Obscura) will be taking over on the upcoming Screen Test shows.</p></blockquote>
