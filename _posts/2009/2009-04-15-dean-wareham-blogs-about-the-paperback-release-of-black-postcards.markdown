<p>Over at the official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090415+/http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=299">Dean & Britta web site</a> Dean has blogged about the imminent paperback release of Black Postcards...</p>
<blockquote><p>The paperback looks great; it has that distinguished Penguin logo right on the front, along with a quote from Liz Phair’s review in the New York Times Book Review: "Fast paced and memorable, peopled with characters you could only find in the music industry. . .  It’s as if a curtain were brushed aside and we all got to go backstage." It almost makes me want to read it myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paperback will be released on 5 May and is available to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143115480?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143115480">pre-order from Amazon.com</a>.</p>
<p>Dean will be doing a couple of readings from the book; firstly at the paperback launch event at the Book Court in Brooklyn on May 8th and then at the Cakeshop in Manhattan on June 17th.</p>
