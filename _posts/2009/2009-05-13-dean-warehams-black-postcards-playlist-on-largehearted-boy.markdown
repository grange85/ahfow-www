<p>The excellent <a href="http://www.largeheartedboy.com/blog/archive/2009/05/book_notes_dean_1.html">Largehearted Boy has published Dean Wareham's "Book Notes" for Black Postcards</a>; "where authors create and discuss a music playlist that relates in some way to their recently published books."</p>
<blockquote><p>Being a memoir by a musician, my book, Black Postcards, does cover a lot of musical ground, beginning with early memories like "Georgy Girl" by the Seekers, ranging through disco, punk, new wave, the paisley underground, shoegazers, a long list of band names from Dogzilla to When People Were Shorter and Lived Near the Water to I Love You But I Have Chosen Darkness. Here are a few songs that informed my book.</p></blockquote>
