<p><a href="http://www.undergroundbee.com/">Robert Loerzel</a> has a good review of one of Dean & Britta's recent Chicago performances of 13 Most Beautiful in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-loerzel/rocking-to-warhol-films_b_173313.html">The Huffington Post</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>At this show, Dean & Britta sounded more like the V.U. than ever. Other than a few loud moments, they stayed on the more delicate end of the V.U. groove, with that trademark sound of tamped-down urgency pulsing underneath the chords. While Wareham and Britta Phillips don't sound precisely like Lou Reed and Nico when they sing, their languid vocals were a close-enough approximation to set the right mood for the screen tests.</p></blockquote>
