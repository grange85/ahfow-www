<p>Damon & Naomi have just launched a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100728081629/http://www.damonandnaomi.com:80/digital.html">digital store selling their new compilation album The Sub Pop Years</a>. As well as being able to buy the album in both mp3 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless">Apple Lossless</a> formats you can also buy one of the many good value packages which combine the album with other Damon & Naomi albuns from their Sub Pop Years.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here's the concept: download our new comp, The Sub Pop Years, with or without a physical copy on CD, and you can add for just a few more dollars a download of any one of the complete original Sub Pop albums. Choose your favorite Sub Pop album -- or one you never heard -- or take the lot of them, by ordering the deluxe packages we've put together.</p></blockquote>
<p>For example for just $19.99 you can buy The Sub Pop Years and all four of the bands Sub Pop albums. There are also packages that include the forthcoming 1001 Nights DVD released by <a href="http://www.factorytwentyfive.com/ftf2/">Factory 25</a> (inlcuding the limited edition that comes with a vinyl copy of Song to the Siren.</p>
