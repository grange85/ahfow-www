<p>The paperback edition of Black Postcards will be published on the 28 April and is currently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143115480?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143115480">availbale to pre-order from Amazon (US)</a></p>
<p>The cover features a more zoomed out picture of the one on the hardback edition and has a quote from <a href="/2008/04/05/black-postcards-a-rock-roll-romance-dean-wareham-book-review-new-york-times/">Liz Phair's review from the New York Times</a>. It also appears that the book is now simply "a memoir" rather than "a rock and roll romance."</p>
<p>I trust that it will also have <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2008/03/14/finishing-the-book/">that mistake</a> fixed!</p>
