<p>Nice to see Dean blogging fairly regularly. Today he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090428+/http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=310">posts about the new Cheval Sombre</a> album and Sunday's launch party in NYC</p>
<blockquote><p>Slept late today, we were up late, celebrating the release of the Cheval Sombre CD. Sunday night was the record release party at Mercury Lounge; Cheval Sombre (joined by Britta on keys and bass, myself on electric guitar and Sonic Boom on the Casio) opened for Psychic Ills and Spectrum.</p></blockquote>
<p>The album is available from the <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/shop.htm">deanandbritta.com shop</a> and also from Amazon as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WC0CYE?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001WC0CYE">CD</a> or as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VWJDRW?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001VWJDRW">download</a>.</p>
