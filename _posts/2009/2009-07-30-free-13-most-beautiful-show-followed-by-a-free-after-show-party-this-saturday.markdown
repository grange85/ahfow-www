<p>On Saturday Dean & Britta will be performing 13 Most Beautiful at the <a href="http://www.prospectpark.org/visit/places/bandshell">Prospect Park Bandshell</a> in Brooklyn as part of the <a href="http://www.bricartsmedia.org/celebrate/">Celebrate Brooklyn festival</a>. Support comes from Crystal Stilts. The show kicks off at 7:30 and is free (but probably worth the suggested <del datetime="2009-07-31T06:24:58+00:00">Â£3</del> <ins datetime="2009-07-31T06:24:58+00:00">$3</ins> donation). Afterwards Dean & Britta will be heading down to the Bell House in New York City for an evening described on the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.thebellhouseny.com/calendar.php">Bell House website</span> as having "special DJ sets and drink specials" - two <em>specials</em> in one sentence... should be good. The party starts at 10:30 and goes on into the early hours of Sunday.</p>
<p>Don't forget to wish Dean a happy birthday - he reaches the grand old age of one-year-older-than-me on Saturday.</p>
