<p>Quick post to wish a Happy Birthday to Dean Wareham, who reaches 46 today. Anyone in the area can spend the day celebrating with Dean at the <a href="http://www.bricartsmedia.org/celebrate/">Celebrate Brooklyn festival in Prospect Park from 7:30</a> or at The Bell House in NYC from 10:30. If not... you can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/visus/486417678/">grab a bottle of coke</a> and drink to him. That's what I'll be doing.</p>
<p>Happy Brithday Dean.</p>
