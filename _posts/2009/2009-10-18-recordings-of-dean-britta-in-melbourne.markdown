<p>Two recordings from Dean & Britta's trip to Melbourne have just turned up on bittorrent site Dimeadozen.</p>
<p>First up a recording of their <a href="http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=271873">13 Most Beautiful performance from 15 October</a> (including Night Nurse and Tugboat as encores)</p>
<p>Next their <a href="http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=271875">in-store appearance with Sand Pebbles at Pure Pop Records on the 17 October</a>.</p>
<p>I've only given a quick listen to a couple of tracks but both sound very good. Registration needed to download from <a href="http://www.dimeadozen.org">DIME</a>.</p>
