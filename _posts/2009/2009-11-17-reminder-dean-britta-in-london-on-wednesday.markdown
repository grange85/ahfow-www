<p>Just a quick reminder that <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">Dean & Britta</a> are playing in London for the first time in over two years tomorrow (Wednesday) night. The show takes place at the very lovely <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.stgilesonline.org/our-church/location.php">St Giles in the Fields</span> church just off Tottenham Court Road. Tickets are Â£12 and are <a href="http://www.wegottickets.com/event/61068">still available from wegottickets</a>.</p>
<p>The promise is that Dean will be raiding the back catalogues of both Galaxie 500 and Luna for this show as well as that of Dean & Britta of course! Support comes from (Double Feature recording artist) <a href="http://www.myspace.com/chevalsombre">Cheval Sombre</a> who will be joined by <a href="http://sonic-boom.info/">Sonic Boom</a> (Spacemen 3/Spectrum) and most probably by Dean & Britta.</p>
<p>Doors open 7pm and curfew is 11pm.</p>
<p>* Off topic: The above picture is of the wonderful <a href="http://theclientele.co.uk/">The Clientele</a> playing at St Giles a couple of years back - if you're at a loose end on Thursday The Clientele are holding the UK launch of their album at <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.theluminaire.co.uk/">The Luminaire</span>.</p>
