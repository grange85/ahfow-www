Back in the early 90s I used to record shows until I realised that often I was worrying more about the recording and not enjoying the show as much as I should. I recorded two Luna shows, first one in London in 1992 (my first recording with my new Walkman Pro and I had it set up all wrong so sounds pretty poor) and [this one from 1993](/database/luna/shows/1993/1993-06-03-luna-borderline-london-uk/)
Firstly here's how I described it when I shared it on easytree a few years back...

> Luna were in town supporting The Velvet Underground on their reunion tour and threw in this headline show at The Borderline. The band seemed in good humour and put on a damn fine show. I remember the "I Want Everything" girl pissing me off at the time but I now find it quite funny and it led to some nice banter from the band "Can we get some Valium down here please".  
> And a couple of Galaxie 500 tracks just to make a great show complete.

And for a bit more on the "I Want Everything" girl here's a story I posted to The Galaxie 500 Mailing List shortly after Luna's last show in London in 2005...

> At the ULU gig there was some heckling going on and Dean said "are you from Colchester?" - which struck me as being an odd thing to say - but hey - who knows what goes on in Dean's head.
> 
> While listening to a London gig [from 1993] the band were being constantly screamed at by a girl - the "I Want Everything girl" (IWEG) as she is now officially known (in my head) - and at one point she screams (and this is just a rough guestimate rather than an accurate transcription as I don't have a copy with me at work today)...
> 
> IWEG: "We're from Colchester"  
> DEAN: "Colchester? Where the hell is that?"

So it seems that Dean either...

_still remembers the endless ear-bashing the IWEG gave him back in '93 (possibly waking up in cold-sweats in the middle of the night)_

or

_has been constantly plagued by hecklers from Colchester for the last 12 years_

if IWEG is on the list I'd like to say that while I was pissed off with you back in 93 - listening again to that show made me appreciate your contribution to a very good night - Thank you!
