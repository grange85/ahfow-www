<p>Back in the early 90s I used to record shows until I realised that often I was worrying more about the recording and not enjoying the show as much as I should. I recorded two Luna shows, <a href="/database/luna/shows/1992/1992-02-27-luna-underworld-london-uk/">their first one in London in 1992</a> (my first recording with my new Walkman Pro and I had it set up all wrong so sounds pretty poor) and <a href="/database/luna/shows/1993/1993-06-03-luna-borderline-london-uk/">this one from 1993</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly here's how I described it when I shared it on easytree a few years back...</p>
<blockquote><p>I just listened to this for the first time for ages and I hadn't realised just how good a recording it was (despite the standard issue SONY tie-clip stereo mic I used).</p>
<p>Luna were in town supporting The Velvet Underground on their reunion tour and threw in this headline show at The Borderline. The band seemed in good humour and put on a damn fine show. I remember the "I Want Everything" girl pissing me off at the time but I now find it quite funny and it led to some nice banter from the band "Can we get some Valium down here please".</p>
<p>And a couple of Galaxie 500 tracks just to make a great show complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for a bit more on the "I Want Everything" girl here's a story I posted to The Galaxie 500 Mailing List shortly after Luna's last show in London in 2005...</p>
<blockquote><p>At the ULU gig there was some heckling going on and Dean said "are you from Colchester?" - which struck me as being an odd thing to say - but hey - who knows what goes on in Dean's head.</p>
<p>While listening to a London gig [from 1993] the band were being constantly screamed at by a girl - the "I Want Everything girl" (IWEG) as she is now officially known (in my head) - and at one point she screams (and this is just a rough guestimate rather than an accurate transcription as I don't have a copy with me at work today)...</p>
<p>IWEG: "We're from Colchester"<br/>DEAN: "Colchester? Where the hell is that?"</p>
<p>So it seems that Dean either...<br/><em>still remembers the endless ear-bashing the IWEG gave him back in '93 (possibly waking up in cold-sweats in the middle of the night)</em><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or<br/><em>has been constantly plagued by hecklers from Colchester for the last 12 years</em></p>
<p>if IWEG is on the list I'd like to say that while I was pissed off with you back in 93 - listening again to that show made me appreciate your contribution to a very good night - Thank you!</p>
