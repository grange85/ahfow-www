<p>There's a <a href="http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Music/78323-Moving-pictures/">short interview with Dean & Britta on The Boston Phoenix website</a> ahead of <a href="http://www.icaboston.org/programs/performance/crash/dean-britta/">this weekends performances of "13 Most Beautiful" at the ICA in Boston</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The pace and length are well suited to Dean & Britta's efficient (yet sufficiently meandering) brand of dreamy pop. Rather than impart a strong sense of milieu to the accompanying songs (as Wareham might have done in composing for more narrative films, like Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale), the two strove to capture the particular mood of each test. "You know when you've got it wrong," says Wareham. The resulting music glows with a timeless quality that complements the everlasting youth and oddball beauty of Warhol's silent subjects</p></blockquote>
