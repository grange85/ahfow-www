<p>American Laundromat have just started taking <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.alr-music.com/index.php?content=shop&amp;no=alr-0021">pre-orders for a special limited edition first pressing of their latest charity compilation Sing Me to Sleep</span>. The album contains lullabies performed by a fine collection of indie artists including Dean & Britta (not sure what their track is as yet, I'll update as soon as I know) as well as Tanya Donnelly, The Antlers and Papercuts (and lots more). The special edition comes with an extra CD of bonus tracks, a 7" single and lots of other bits and pieces plus the chance to win a signed copy.</p>
<p>The album isn't released in the shops until <em>May 2010 (!)</em> but pre-orderers will get them early (not sure how early) so if you fancy handing over your money early head on over to the shiny new <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.alr-music.com/index.php?content=shop&amp;no=alr-0021">American Laundromat website</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>All proceeds from the project will be donated to <a href="http://www.thevaleriefund.org/">The Valerie Fund</a>, a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization that provides support for the comprehensive health care of children with cancer and blood disorders. </p></blockquote>
