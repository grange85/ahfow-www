<p>As part of their guest editor sojourn at Magnet Magazine's web site Britta has taken the opportunity to <a href="http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2009/03/05/from-the-desk-of-dean-britta-spectrum/">sing the praises of Sonic Boom and Spectrum</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was totally blown away. So much so that I caught a ride with them to the ATP festival, where they were playing the next night. Spectrum was the best band I saw there. (I heard J Mascis said the same.) Sonic has one of the coolest and most original voices, and his band is primal and truly exciting. It is rare and thrilling to see a friend transform into a rock star.</p></blockquote>
<p>She mentions the show that Sonic is <a href="http://www.mercuryloungenyc.com/event/2766">playing in NYC with Cheval Sombre on 26 April</a> and mentions the â€œspecial guests (wink, wink)" who'll be showing up.</p>
