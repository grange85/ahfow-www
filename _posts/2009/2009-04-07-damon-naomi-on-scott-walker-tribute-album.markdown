<p>Damon & Naomi have covered "The World's Strongest Man" for a forthcoming Scott Walker tribute album. The album with the snappy title "Music inspired by the film Scott Walker 30 Century Man" will be <a href="http://www.lakeshore-records.com/scottwalker/?tracklisting">released by Lakeshore Records in May</a> and also includes contrinbutions from Laurie Anderson, Ulrich Schnauss and St Etienne amongst others.</p>
<p>The album is being curated by Stephen Kijak the documentary maker responsible for the <a href="http://www.scottwalkerfilm.com/blog/">Scott Walker film</a>.</p>
<p><del datetime="2009-04-12T23:32:28+00:00">The album is listed on Amazon.com but is currently priced at $18.50 so you might want to site tight until it reaches a sensible price before ordering.</del></p>
