<p>Last Friday night Dean & Britta performed a <a href="/database/show/2009-03-20-dean-britta-the-grind-clark-university-worcester-ma-usa/">low key and sparsely attended show at The Grind in Clark University, Worcester MA</a>. A kind soul (thanks Matt) sent me a recording of the show which included a nice mix of Dean & Britta, Luna, Galaxie 500 and a few of the songs from "13 Most Beautiful" one of which I now pass on to you. "I'll Keep it With Mine" was written for Nico by Bob Dylan and Dean & Britta use it, obviously, to accompany Nico's screen test.</p>
