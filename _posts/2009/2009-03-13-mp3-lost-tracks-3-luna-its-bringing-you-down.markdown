<p><a href="https://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/track/114/">It’s Bringing You Down</a> was released on an EP on No.6 Records which was the label run by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Tolkin">Terry Tolkin</a> who features in depth in <a href="/2009/02/13/black-postcards-in-paperback/">Black Postcards</a> and got a name-check in justin’s fake-telegram at the last Luna shows. As far as I’m aware the EP has never been released digitally and the only hope of laying your hands on it is second-hand – <del datetime="2009-04-12T23:34:58+00:00">not that it’s a rarity mind you, there are 6 copies currently on Amazon</del>.</p>
<p>I hadn't listened too much to this EP for years but was inspired to recently because one of the tracks on it, <a href="https://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/track/115/">The Enabler</a>, has been revived to accompany Dennis Hopper in 13 Most Beautiful. It's Bringing You Down is a cracking lost Luna track. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
