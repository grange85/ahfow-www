<p>Dean & Britta are playing at the very lovely <a href="http://www.stgilesonline.org/">St Giles-in-the-Fields church</a> in London on Wednesday the 18th of November. The show is being put on by <a href="http://www.soniccathedral.co.uk/">Sonic Cathedral</a> and tickets are on sale now through <a href="http://www.wegottickets.com/event/61068">WeGotTickets for Â£12</a>.</p>
<p>This will be a regular Dean & Britta show (not 13 Most Beautiful). I'll be there... you should be too.</p>
