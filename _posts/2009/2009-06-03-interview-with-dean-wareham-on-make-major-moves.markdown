<p>Philadelphia Weekly's music blog Make Major Moves has just posted <span class="removed_link" title="http://music.pwblogs.com/2009/06/03/a-conversation-with-dean-wareham-part-one/">part one of a long Q&A with Dean Wareham</span>. Mostly discussing the writing process and content of Black Postcards...</p>
<blockquote><p>I think at a certain point I realized that several people are going to be upset by this and by that, and if I went back and took out every thing that was going to upset somebody, it would just be a puff-piece and not a very interesting book. And I think part of the larger point I was trying to make about being in a band is that it’s all about conflict. And so I wanted to go into some of that conflict.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <span class="removed_link" title="http://music.pwblogs.com/2009/06/04/a-conversation-with-dean-wareham-part-two/">Part two of the interview is online now</span> - more talk about the book, about 13 Most Beautiful and about Galaxie 500...</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s hard to sing those songs, too. I feel like I need to cough, and I sing real high. Your voice naturally lowers as you get older, I think. And also, I didn’t know how to sing at all in Galaxie 500 [...] That’s absolutely part of the charm of it, when people say, you know, the vocals on the first Galaxie 500 album sound like I’m singing from outer space. I think I was thrown out there in front of a microphone and I’d never really been in that situation, I hadn’t practiced in front of a microphone, and I only got one take of everything. I’ve since learned that it’s on the third take that I start to get it good. It’s never the first. Sometimes the second. With vocals, that is.</p></blockquote>
