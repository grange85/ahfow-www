<p>Dean & Britta are this weeks <a href="http://www.magnetmagazine.com/category/guest-editor/">guest editor</a> at <a href="http://www.magnetmagazine.com/">Magnet Magazine's website</a> and their tenure kicked off yesterday with a Q&A interview during which he confirms that the last page of Black Postcards will be fixed for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143115480?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143115480">paperback edition</a> (my apologies for going on about just how much that bothered me!)</p>

Wareham: I have fixed a few things for the paperback edition (due April 28). Apparently, I had gotten the last song at the final Luna show wrong. That was because my set list that night said the last song was “Indian Summer.” I forgot that we had changed it during a last-minute discussion before the show to “23 Minutes in Brussels.”</p></blockquote>
