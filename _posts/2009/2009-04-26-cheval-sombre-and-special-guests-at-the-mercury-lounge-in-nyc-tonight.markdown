<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/chevalsombre">Cheval Sombre</a>, who's album will be released this week on Dean & Britta's Double Feature Records are supporting <a href="http://www.sonic-boom.info/">Sonic Boom</a>'s Spectrum at the Mercury Lounge in NYC this evening. <a href="http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2009/03/05/from-the-desk-of-dean-britta-spectrum/">In a post about Spectrum</a> as part of the <a href="/2009/03/09/wrapping-up-dean-brittas-week-guest-editing-magnetmagazinecom/">Dean & Britta's week of guest editing the Magnet website</a> last month it was mentioned the show and said that "Cheval Sombre is opening with 'special guests'" and on Britta's Facebook page this week she mentioned that she was "rehearsing Cheval Sombre songs for tomorrow night's show..." so I think there's no doubt who the special guests will be.</p>
