<p>The Sonic Boom remix of White Horses that was released in 2007 on Sonic Cathedral records will appear on <a href="http://soniccathedral.bigcartel.com/">Cathedral Classics Volume One</a> - a compilation of the first 11 releases on the label. The album is available from the <a href="http://soniccathedral.bigcartel.com/">Sonic Cathedral shop</a> for £10 on CD or for £8 as <del datetime="2009-04-03T16:17:55+00:00">a very limited boxed set of the eleven 7" singles (which means you also get the version fran&ccedil;aise of White Horses as well)</del> an empty box into which you can put your existing singles (Apologies for the confusion and thanks to PhilH for pointing out my error).</p>
