<p>Nice, funny <a href="http://thenewgay.net/2009/06/dean-britta.html">interview with Dean & Britta at The New Gay</a>, touching on gays in the army, who  they'd "go gay" for and the dawnings of heterosexuality...</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The New Gay:</strong> When did you first realize you were straight?<br />
<strong>Dean Wareham:</strong> I remember looking at dirty magazines, probably around age 10, and being aroused by photos of naked ladies. I did make out with a girl named Wendy Little at age 8 but it wasnâ€™t particularly sexual.<br />
<strong>Britta Phillips:</strong> When I was 7. I had fantasies about David Cassidy.</p></blockquote>
