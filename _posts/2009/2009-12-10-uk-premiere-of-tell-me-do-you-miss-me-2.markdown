<p>The Dream Machine Christmas party takes place at The Half Moon in Herne Hill on Sunday 20 December and features the UK premiere of Matthew Buzzell's film of Luna's farewell tour Tell Me Do You Miss Me. The event kicks off at 6pm and at some point during the evening will also features the Dream Machine All-Stars playing a set of rare Luna songs and covers. And all of this for a cover price of nothing at all...FREE!</p>

<p>Here's a clip of Luna playing 23 Minutes in Brussels from the film so you can imagine how great it will be to see this in a room full of Luna fans watching it on a big screen.</p>
