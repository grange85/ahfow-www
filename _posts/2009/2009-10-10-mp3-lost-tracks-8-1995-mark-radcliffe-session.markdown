<p>Luna stopped off in Manchester for this session on <a href="/database/show/1995-12-13-luna-bbc-radio-one-manchester-uk/">Mark Radcliffe's BBC Radio 1 show on the 13 December 1995</a>. I remember staying up to record this. I went through my box of cassettes a while ago to try and find it but couldn't track it down, which is a shame as I remember the interview being quite amusing... and at one point touched on the subject of, if memory serves, <a href="http://angelcorpuschristi.blogspot.com/">Angel Corpus Christi</a> faxing intimate self-portraits to Dean.</p>
<p>Luckily the three tracks turned up on the <a href="/database/release/season-of-the-witch-release/">Season of the Witch CD single</a> put out by Beggars Banquet in 1996 (without the interviews but certainly better than my crappy FM recording).</p>

<p>UPDATE: There were some digital blips in my rip so I've taken new rips from the CD - not sure they're any better...</p>
