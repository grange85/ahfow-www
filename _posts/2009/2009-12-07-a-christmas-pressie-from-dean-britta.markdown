<p>Dean & Britta are giving away a download of their lovely Christmas single from a couple of years ago. He's Coming Home was originally released as a 7" single on <a href="http://www.chimneyrocks.org/hescominghome.html">Chimney Rocks! Records</a> but now is available in digital form from Dean & Britta in return for your email address. Head over to the <a href="http://promo.11spot.com/deanandbritta/holiday_bonus">He's Coming Home promo website</a> and enter your email and the code <strong>oldtoytrains</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're looking for pressies for friends, family (or yourself) you can also grab the very lovely black Galaxie 500 T-shirt from <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/shop.htm">Dean & Britta's online store</a> (as well as lots of other goodies).</p>
