<p>Dean seems to have moved his blog from <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">deanandbritta.com</a> to the <span class="removed_link" title="http://ilike.com/artist/Dean+%2526+Britta">couple's iLike page</span> (although I suspect crossposting back to the official site and MySpace). In <span class="removed_link" title="http://ilike.com/artist/Dean+%2526+Britta/blog/365968700">the latest post</span> he blogs about food, upcoming shows and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabriskie_Point_(film)">Zabriskie Point</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Thursday we’ll be eating cheesesteak sandwiches in Philadelphia; before our show at Johnny Brenda’s, Friday it will be chili dogs before our gig at the Black Cat in D.C., and Saturday night we will eat and perform at Le Poisson Rouge on Bleecker Street in Manhattan. This last is an early show – Cheval Sombre will go on at 7:30, we’ll be on at 8:30. These will likely be our last non-Warhol shows of the year, at least here in the USA.</p></blockquote>
