<p>Guitrarrorists was a compilation of solo guitar pieces curated by Kramer and released on No.6 Records in 1991. Contributions came from such indie lumninaries as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurston_Moore">Thurston Moore</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Albini">Steve Albini</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Mascis">J Mascis</a>. I listened to the whole album a few weeks back and must admit I found it mostly heavy going.</p>
<p>Dean Wareham's contribution is this nice little number entitled West Broadway. Enjoy.</p>
