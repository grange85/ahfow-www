<p>A couple of blogs (<a href="http://scoutmagazine.ca/2009/01/21/dean-wareham-at-zulu-records/">1</a>, <a href="http://communities.canada.com/theprovince/blogs/stuartsblog/archive/2009/01/20/dean-wareham-ex-luna-at-zulu-before-push-appearance.aspx">2</a>) have mentioned that Dean Wareham will be doing a reading/signing/performance at <a href="http://www.zulurecords.com/">Zulu Records</a> in Vancouver on Saturday (31 Jan) at 4pm. I was waiting for confirmation on the Zulu records site or Dean & Britta's blog or MySpace, but so far nothing so best get confirmation if you're travelling any distance.</p>
<p>On Friday (30 Jan) Dean & Britta will be performing "13 Most Beautiful" at the Vogue Theater in Vancouver as part of the <a href="http://pushfestival.ca/index.php?mpage=shows&spage=main&id=77#show">PuSh Festival</a>.</p>
