<p><span class="removed_link" title="http://earfarm.com/band-of-the-week/3208">Earfarm has a nice interview with Dean Wareham</span> and is also giving away five copies of the paperback...</p>
<blockquote><p>Wait, you haven’t bought it yet? Well, I guess it’s a good thing we have FIVE paperback copies to give away. Interested? Write to us and let us know in a sentence or two why you want to read Black Postcards. We’ll pick our five favorite responses next week</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="removed_link" title="http://earfarm.com/band-of-the-week/3208">Head on over to Earfarm</span> for details about how to enter.</p>
<p>Nice also to see in the interview that Dean was "annoyed" about the last page error - it wasn't just me!</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah, I’ve had some people tell me I’m wrong about things but sometimes they’re wrong. I got the last song that we played at the final Luna show wrong. I was pretty annoyed about that (laughs). But in my defense, the reason I was wrong was because I was working from notes and I had made the setlist for the final show and still had it on my computer, and what I forgot was that at the last minute before we went on stage we switched around the last two songs.</p></blockquote>
