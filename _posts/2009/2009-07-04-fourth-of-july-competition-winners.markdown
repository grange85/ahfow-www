<p>An impressive number of entries to <a href="/2009/06/30/silly-fourth-of-july-competition/">this year's competition</a> - TWO ... compared to last year's NONE - made it tricky to pick a winner. Except... as there was always likely to be more than one winner it was actually pretty easy and the only tricky bit was inventing the categories in which they had both won. Both entered the photo section (I sadly never got any dog-biscuit poetry... maybe I'll bang one out myself). So...</p>
<p><strong>Winner #1</strong> in the <em>making imaginative use of the Internet</em> section is Deanna...<br />

<p><strong>Winner #2</strong> in the <em>taking advantage of their location</em> section is Ro...<br />
<figure class="caption aligncenter" width="400" caption="also not bigger in height"><img src="https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/ahfow/uploads/2009/07/photo.jpg" alt="also not bigger in height" title="Also No bigger than a nickel" width="400" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-1393" /><figcaption class="caption-text"></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here's my poem...</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear doggie,<br />
I know you're likely to ignore this biscuit,<br />
You'd probably prefer a rack-of-lamb or some brisket.
</p></blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<p>I'll be in touch with the winners to offload some duplicate CDs - you'll both get a Mahogany double CD because I have THREE of them! Thank you both for entering and by doing so making me not feel so much of an idiot... although the poem might have ruined your good work on that front.</p>
<p>If you can see some enjoy the fireworks.</p>
