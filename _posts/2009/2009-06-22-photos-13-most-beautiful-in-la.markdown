<p>It seems that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/8659959@N05/">Flickr user RexSteed</a> spent Saturday evening snapping away during Dean & Britta's performance of 13 Most Beautiful at the Ford Amphitheatre in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Which means that we can sit through a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/8659959@N05/sets/72157620151707446/show/">slideshow of most of the 13</a> (I make it 11) as well as pictures of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/8659959@N05/3649313270/in/set-72157620151707446/">one of the 13, Mary Woronow, being interviewed on stage before the show</a>.</p>
