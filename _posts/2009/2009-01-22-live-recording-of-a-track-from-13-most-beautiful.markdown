<p><a href="http://www.thesoundofindie.com/?p=1052">The Sound Of Indie</a> has posted a live recording of one of the songs from 13 Most Beautiful (anyone care to identify it for me? <ins datetime="2009-01-22T15:44:41+00:00"><strong>Update</strong>: Thanks Jeff for pointing out that I really ought to have known what the track was - it's The Enabler as previously released on <a href="/database/release/luna-release/">a Luna EP</a> and is used in 13 Most Beautiful to accompany Dennis Hopper.</ins>)</p>
<blockquote><p>These four minute short-films provide the perfect template for Dean & Britta to provide a song-length soundtrack to each. Dean & Britta performed a few on their own songs, a few wicked good covers, a few instrumentals, and a few new songs — all killer. The films and Dean & Britta’s Velvet Underground inspired stylings are perfectly suited together. Be sure to check it out if you can.</p></blockquote>
<p>A perfect appetite whetter for the DVD which will be released next month and that you can...</p>
