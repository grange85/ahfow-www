<p>The Walker Arts Center blog has <a href="http://blogs.walkerart.org/performingarts/2009/02/23/dean-britta-added-show-and-more-behind-the-8-ball/">posted a nice Q&A with Dean & Britta</a> in preparation for next weeks <a href="http://walkerart.org/tickets">two performances at the Minneapolis venue</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you see as your artistic legacy?<br />
Dean: I like getting emails from kids telling me that they just listened to Galaxie 500 as the sun came up.<br />
Britta: For me it’s L’Avventura. I love that album and am very proud of it. But we’re still making music so… one never knows what will come next. </p></blockquote>
