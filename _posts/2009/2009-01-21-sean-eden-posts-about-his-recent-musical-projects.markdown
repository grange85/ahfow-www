<p>Far from prolific blogger <a href="http://seaneden.com">Sean Eden</a> finally made good on his promise (of last March!) to "place some links [to] recent developments that deserve attention in an upcoming post". <span class="removed_link" title="http://seaneden.net/2009/01/20/im-back/">His blog post yesterday</span> filled us in on some of his recent musical projects including <a href="http://www.myspace.com/gramercyarms">Gramercy Arms</a> (with Dave Derby) and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/nightpeopled">Night People</a> with Matthew Buzzell and Lee Wall). He's also offering guitar lessons so if you're in the NYC area and fancy being taught by Sean then <a href="http://www.myspace.com/seaneden">zip over to his MySpace page</a> and contact him a bit sharpish because he only has a room for three new students!</p>
