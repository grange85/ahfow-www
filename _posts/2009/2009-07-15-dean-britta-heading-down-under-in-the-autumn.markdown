<p>Dean & Britta will be taking 13 Most Beautiful to the Melbourne International Arts Festival in Australia this autumn. The show will be performed on the 15th, 16th and 17th of October at the Merlyn Theatre. Details at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100627043428/http://www.melbournefestival.com.au:80/program/production?id=3583&amp;idx=2&amp;max=67">the festival website</a> where you can also buy tickets. I'm not sure if they have any other dates planned down under but as soon as I hear I'll post here.</p>
