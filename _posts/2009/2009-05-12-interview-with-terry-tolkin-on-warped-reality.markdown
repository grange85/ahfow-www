<p><a href="http://www.warpedrealitymagazine.com/2009/05/the_mysteries_of_no_6_an_inter.html">Warped Reality has a long interview with Terry Tolkin</a> one of the stars of Dean Wareham's book Black Postcards. The interview deals with Terry's independent label No.6 Records as well as his time as an A&R man for Elektra Records during which time he signed Luna and a myriad of other cool bands.</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm proud to say that I signed [Luna, Stereolab & The Afghan Whigs], I didn't sign Th' Faith Healers. I don't know who signed them —most likely they came through the International Department but they were A&R'd by Nancy Jeffries. She is the most unflappable human on the planet. She went on to head the A&R Department after the disposition of Bob Krasnow and, later, Howard Thompson. Those two men were the real reason that Elektra managed to have the Pixies, Danny Gatton, Metallica, Brand Nubian and jennnyanykind all on the label’s radar.</p></blockquote>
<p>The interview is promoting Speed Dating a new compilation of all the singles released on No.6 Records that has been released by <a href="http://teenbeat.net/">Teenbeat</a>. The album includes Dean Wareham's pre-Luna single <a href="/database/release/anesthesia-release/">Anesthesia/I Can't Wait</a> and  the Cagney & Lacee single <a href="/database/release/time-cagney-and-lacee/">Time/By The Way (I Still Love You)</a></p>
<p>All the masters had been destrioyed in a fire so the album was compiled from vinyl acquired on eBay...</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to cobble together this compilation, I had to buy most of the singles on the Internet. They went for between literally 1 penny to $68.00.</p>
<p>Then I had to send them all to Dean Wareham, who has a turntable and burned them onto a CD. That went to Mark E. Robinson at Teenbeat, who spent many hours equalizing everything and trying to take out as many pop ands skips as possible. What a man.</p>
