Luna have just made available a fantastic live recording of their Penthouse show at The Chapel in San Francisco from January 2017

This is the second of three albums released over three months of Bandcamp Fridays and includes the band playing the full Penthouse album plus a bonus of Tracy I Love You - that had originally been recorded during the Penthouse sessions but never made it onto the record.

As with [Bewitched last month](/2022/02/04/luna-live-bewitched-on-bandcamp/) the album has been mixed by Lee Wall at his studio in Austin, Texas - and sounds every bit as good as you can imagine.

The final release in this series will Rendezvous on 1st April.

You can [checkout and then buy 'Live Penthouse'](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/live-penthouse) over on Bandcamp now.

And if you missed it last month you can still [buy 'Live Bewitched'](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/live-bewitched) over on Bandcamp too.
