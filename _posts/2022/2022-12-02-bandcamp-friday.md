Today is the last Bandcamp Friday of the year so time to fill your boots before Christmas and since Bandcamp waive their fee all of your cash reaches the pockets of the artists.


My [long list of AHFoW related releases on Bandcamp is over here](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/articles/bandcamp-releases/) - I've added a few things but there is certainly things missing!

There are just six copies of the [fab Galaxie 500 tribute On Fire 30](https://aheadfullofwishes.bandcamp.com/album/on-fire-30) with the limited booklet available here (or you can just buy the CD, or digital versions)

No physical copies but still available digitally is the [fab Galaxie 500 tribute This Music Is Ours](https://aheadfullofwishes.bandcamp.com/album/this-music-is-ours)
