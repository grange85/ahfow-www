Back in November Dean & Britta were in the WXPN studios in Philadelphia to record a couple of songs for The Indie Rock Hit Parade radio show - the songs were aired last night and videos of the performances shared on the WXPN YouTube.

Beautiful gentle performances of As Much As It Was Worth from Dean's beautiful recent album [I Have Nothing to Say to The Mayor of L.A.](/database/dean-and-britta/dean-wareham-releases/dean-wareham-i-have-nothing-to-say-to-the-mayor-of-la/) and Luna's Into The Fold (from [Bewitched](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/releases/luna-bewitched/))
