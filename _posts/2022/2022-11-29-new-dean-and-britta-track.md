This appearance continues an unbroken relationship with Noah Baumbach that goes back to Highball and Mr Jealousy in 1997.

Dean posted ...

> [I] wrote and performed a paranoid song about the billowing toxic cloud, the downing of KAL 007, experiments with chimpanzees -- for Noah Baumbach's WHITE NOISE movie.

The soundtrack (the rest of which is by Danny Elfman) has appeared in [all the usual places](https://netflixmusic.ffm.to/whitenoise) and the film is released on Netflix on the 30th November.
