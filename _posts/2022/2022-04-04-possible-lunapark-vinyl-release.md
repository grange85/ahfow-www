Luna's debut album, Lunapark, is [in the running for a deluxe vinyl re-issue](https://www.runoutgroovevinyl.com/vote-for-next-release) from Run Out Groove Records. 

Each month Run Out Groove hold a poll of three albums for a potential release and this month sees Luna's debut running off against country legend George Jones and Swedish prog-metal band Opeth.

Lunapark has previously only been released on vinyl on Australian label Summershine in 1993, and as part of the Captured Tracks Luna box set in 2015, and should the Run Out Groove release come to pass will include "previously unreleased pre-Elektra demos" and "never-before-seen photos".

[Head over to the Run Our Grooves web site to vote](https://www.runoutgroovevinyl.com/vote-for-next-release) - voting closes on the 11th April - so get your vote in now!

In a previous poll [Lunafied got the deluxe reissue](/2018/06/09/pre-order-lunas-lunafied-on-vinyl/) treatment and was a rather beautiful thing so... get voting.
