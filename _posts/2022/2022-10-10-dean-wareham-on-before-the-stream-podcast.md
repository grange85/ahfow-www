Dean Wareham appears on the latest issue of the [Before The Stream podcast](https://beforethestream.libsyn.com/nirvana-unplugged-the-man-who-sold-the-world-with-dean-wareham) (almost) talking about the Nirvana Unplugged cover of David Bowie's The Man Who Sold The World. The shows host is singer songwriter and sometime Dean & Britta drummer Jason Bemis Lawrence.

> Before the Stream is currently talking about Nirvana's MTV Unplugged In New York one song at a time.
> 
> Dean's band Luna was making major label rock albums at the same time Nirvana was, so he has an interesting perspective on the time period. 
> 
> Dean and Jason talk about the aesthetics of "Unplugged", vocals, covers, and more. 

Always cool to hear him talk music!
