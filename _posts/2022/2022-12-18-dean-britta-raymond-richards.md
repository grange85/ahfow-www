 > My good friend David Beach and I talked first about writing an ambient record in 2019, and actually began the making of it at my studio. Pandemic times made it impossible to continue in person, so I hunkered down in my basement and wrote every day for months, collaborating with all my most talented friends to make this record. Beach and I spent long days figuring out what this album would be, and I couldnâ€™t be more proud to finally share it with you.

Britta sings on the track "House of Girls" and Dean plays guitar on The Rhythm King Rides Again.

Raymond was in Dean's touring band in 2013/14.
