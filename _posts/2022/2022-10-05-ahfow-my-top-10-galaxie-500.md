A while back the nice folk at [Poetic Justice](https://poeticjusticemagazine.com) magazine asked if I'd compile my top 10 Galaxie 500 songs. After the initial thrill of being asked I suddently realised what a ridiculous task it was trying to condense Galaxie 500's catalogue down to 10 songs... but I tried, and you can [see my top 10 and my thoughts and reasoning](https://poeticjusticemagazine.com/2022/10/04/a-head-full-of-wishes-top-10-galaxie-500-songs/) over at Poetic Justice.

You can also listen to a playlist of my top 10 on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/013580TSHgy5mUpgQyBLvv) and [Tidal](https://tidal.com/playlist/6d961ee1-c13b-4851-8c6c-e35425108e0d)_(thanks Dan)_
