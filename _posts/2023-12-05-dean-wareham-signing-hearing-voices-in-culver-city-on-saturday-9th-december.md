Dean & Ed will be signing at Arcana Books between 4 and 6 on Saturday the 9th December.

The book is a very lovely collection of Dean's lyrics and well worth getting your hands on a copy so, if you're near enough this would be a good chance to get one! However, if you can't make it along you can [order a signed copy here](https://www.arcanabooks.com/catalog/search/?author=&title=&publisher=&keywords=Wareham&book_number=&publication_year_0=&publication_year_1=&price_0=&price_1=&binding=&sort_by=price&order_by=asc&mc_cid=1e6ff845f6&mc_eid=cf040a72dd)
