This is a promo copy of Galaxie 500's Peel Sessions that was sent to me ahead of the official release in 2005.

I actually can't remember who sent me this copy - I'd guess Damon and/or Naomi, but I can't find the gushing email thanking them. I did find a gushing email thanking Damon for _finally_ giving the Peel Sessions a proper release:

<blockquote>
<p>Hi Damon,</p>
<p>Wow that was an exciting bit of news (well for me anyway) -
particularly as I'd only this week been moaning on the Galaxie 500
mailing list about how shabbily us completists were being treated by
the fact that the Peel sessions were seemingly unlikely to ever get an
official release. I wish you'd given me heads up so that I could at
least continue to dream that I was some great G500 authority :)</p>
<p>Thanks for doing this!</p>
<p>-=Andy=-</p>
</blockquote>

In his reply I noticed he pretty much confirmed what I speculated in a [previous post](/2023/07/20/my-record-collection-053-galaxie-500-peel-sessions/) that the sessions where chronologically switched to get Submission at the beginning:

<blockquote>
We've rearranged the sequence of the tracks -- we put the second
session first, so it goes in reverse chronological order -- and we're
kicking it off with Submission (which still makes me laugh).
</blockquote>

I understand the decision to flip the sessions, but I can't help being bothered by things not being in order!

While I'm not a particularly big fan of the sleeve of this release I do rather love the line drawing of Naomi's flower earrings on the disc, and it looks even better (to me) on the silver disc of this promo, rather than the brown of the official release.
