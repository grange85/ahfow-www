Louie Louie is Angel Corpus Christi's album of songs "by, for, and about Lou Reed" and includes her duet with Dean Wareham on _I Want to Boogie With You/Je t'aime_ that was previously released on a couple of 7" singles.

It also has Dean and Britta guesting on a cover of Femme Fatale, a song that Angel seems to visit at regular intervals, having been on her excellent I&#9825;NY album in 1985, and a solo accordion version on 2003's Accordion Pop Volume 1. The version on Louie Louie also has Sonic Boom performing and producing and is lovely... as is the whole album and it, like a lot of Angel's catalogue, can be bought for peanuts on her Bandcamp.

I bought this CD, along with Accordion Pop, via mail order from Glasgow shop Volcanic Tongue in 2005.
