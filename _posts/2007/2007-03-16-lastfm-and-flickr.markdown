<p>I've just created groups for A Head Full of Wishes on both the excellent music site <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/A+Head+Full+of+Wishes">Last.fm</a> and the equally wonderful photo sharing site <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/aheadfullofwishes/">Flickr</a> - please come and join.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> is a music sharing and discovery site that keeps track (and makes charts) of all the music you play and helps you to discover similar artists and like-minded people. <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>'s pretty much the same thing except swap <em>photos</em> for <em>music</em> (and ignore the bit about tracking and charts)</p>
