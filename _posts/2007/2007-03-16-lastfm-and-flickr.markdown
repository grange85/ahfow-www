I've just created groups for A Head Full of Wishes on both the excellent music site [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/group/A+Head+Full+of+Wishes) and the equally wonderful photo sharing site [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/groups/aheadfullofwishes/) - please come and join.

[Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) is a music sharing and discovery site that keeps track (and makes charts) of all the music you play and helps you to discover similar artists and like-minded people. [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com)'s pretty much the same thing except swap _photos_ for _music_ (and ignore the bit about tracking and charts)
