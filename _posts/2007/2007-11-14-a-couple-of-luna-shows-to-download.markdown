There are a couple of Luna shows being re-seeded on Dimeadozen (registration required) right now. Two Chicago shows from the bands final tour - both excellent recordings and well worth a download. 


> This is a reseed of a really nice audience recording. I'm not the taper (his info below) just a bystander at the show. Luna did two nights at the Abbey Pub on their last tour. They were originally to be the last two shows in Chicago, but the band came back and played another show at the Metro just a week or two before their final shows in New York.
