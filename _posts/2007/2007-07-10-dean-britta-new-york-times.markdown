<p>Dean & Britta are featured in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/fashion/08nite.html">sweet and pointless piece on the NY Times website</a>. It's a short description of a night out.</p>
<blockquote><p>The married couple and band Dean & Britta met in 2000 when Ms. Phillips auditioned to be the singer and bassist in Mr. Wareham’s former indie-rock band, Luna. They claim the attraction was instant. Both in their early 40s, they’ve either mellowed out, or have always been as offensive as candy stripers.</p></blockquote>
