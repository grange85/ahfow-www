<p><a href="http://www.blogotheque.net/article.php3?id_article=3102">Les concerts a emorter de Blogotheque</a> features Damon & Naomi performing (and drinking a lot of wine it seems!) in a Parisian apartment. The first video features covers of The Everly Brothers <em>I Wonder If...</em> and Bob Dylan's <em>Hey Sister</em>. The second video is Araca Azul/The Earth is Blue.</p>
<p>The videos can be streamed or downloaded from <a href="http://www.blogotheque.net/article.php3?id_article=3102">La Blogotheque's website</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Naomi Yang and Damon Krukowski live in Boston, like the French wine, and had promised to come to Paris space a few weeks from tasting. It was last January, it was to make cold outside, the lights of the' Old Camper' flooded the street of the district of Maubert where the apartment was located. And the wine was delicious.<br/><em>(via Google Translate!)</em></p></blockquote>
