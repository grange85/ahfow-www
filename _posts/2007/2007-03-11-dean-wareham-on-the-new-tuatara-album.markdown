<p>Back in 1996, while still a member of Luna, Justin Harwood teamed up with Pete Buck (REM) and Barrett Martin (Screaming Trees) to form the instrumental supergroup <span class="removed_link" title="http://tuatara.com/">Tuatara</span>. The band have their fourth album, East of the Sun released in June, although as far as I can tell Justin is no longer a member. However the band have branched into having vocals on their album and have guest appearances by a bunch of familiar names including Dean Wareham.</p>
<p>You can <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.fasthorserecordings.com/jukeTeS.html">listen to the whole album</span> on the <a href="http://www.fasthorserecordings.com">Fast Horse Recordings</a> website - Dean appears on the tracks "Trouble Rides In" and "Your Ghost Town", other guest vocalists Mark Eitzel, John Wesley Harding and Victoria Williams.</p>
