<p>Naomi has just posted to the <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=52968500&blogID=327806912">Damon & Naomi MySpace Blog</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I had considered writing a blog/tour diary on this long, long tour we've been on...[but] I don't have a laptop of my own and I think keeping a blog must require not having to constantly borrow someone else's computer!</p></blockquote>
<p>The European tour dates have been updated on their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/damonandnaomi">MySpace page</a>.</p>
