<p>In my ongoing effort to spray A Head Full of Wishes all over the Internet and to open up eyes to all that's great about Galaxie 500 (and all that happened since), I have now created the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.youtube.com/group/fullofwishes">A Head Full of Wishes group on YouTube</span> - I've no idea if anyone ever uses the groups on YouTube - I've been a member for ages and never have - but...it's there now - post your videos and talk about them - if it takes your fancy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/aheadfullofwishes/">Flickr group</a> is coming along nicely and has some lovely <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/aheadfullofwishes/pool/">pictures in the pool</a>, and the <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/A+Head+Full+of+Wishes">Last.fm group</a> is slowly growing. So if you're a member of any of these sites please come and join up.</p>
