Dean & Britta have contributed a song to the new Noah Baumbach film [Margot at the Wedding](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0757361/). Film music blog ["The Playlist" has the full soundtrack listing](http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2007/10/margot-at-wedding-soundtrack-tracklist.html) which also includes Donovan's Teen Angel which Dean & Britta covered on Back Numbers. "The Playlist" also mentions Dean & Britta's role in the film...


> there is no score music to this film but Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips (whose "Nothern Blue" track is featured on the soundtrack) acted as the film's music consultants.

You can hear the Dean & Britta track at the [film's MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/margotatthewedding)
