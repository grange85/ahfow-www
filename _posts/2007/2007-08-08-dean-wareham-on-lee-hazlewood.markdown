The great Lee Hazlewood passed away last week after a long battle with cancer. Dean Wareham has just posted a tribute to him on the Dean & Britta MySpace blog along with excerpts from an interview he did with Lee in 1999.


> It has been a week of big losses - Bergman, Antonioni, and now Hazlewood. Inspirations all, but it is Hazlewood whose death hits me the hardest. We put "Soul's Island" by Lee on the stereo last night and drank a glass of wine in his honor.
