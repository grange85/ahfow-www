<p>You can download Damon & Naomi's recent performance in Washington DC from <a href="http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=168304">www.dimeadozen.org</a> - registration is required.</p>
<p>It's a decent recording although the taper was a little unimpressed...</p>
<blockquote><p>So, that said, this is basically girlfriend music. Very nicely orchestrated girlfriend music - with four musicians, they still manage to create a very dense atmosphere of sound (I guess a cello'll do that for ya) - but if you're expecting a dense atmosphere of moods and musical risks to accompany the orchestrations, you might as well go out and strangle a bear with your bare hands, you manly man you. Girlfriend music isn't bad by definition - think of it as the difference between post-rock and prog-rock, really. It's just, you know... girlfriend music.</p></blockquote>
