<p>No mention of the article on the <a href="http://www.guitarplayer.com/">Guitar Player website</a> but apparently Dean Wareham is featured in a list of "The Top 40 Underrated guitarists" in the December 2007 issue. He shares the list with Robbie Krieger of The Doors and Mick Ronson which is decent enough company.</p>
<p>Any guitarists who have a copy feel free to email me a scan!</p>
<p>I love how the list negates itself - once you're in a list of underrated artists you're surely no longer underrated and so shouldn't be on the list...</p>
