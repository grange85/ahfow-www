I just came across [this review on derives.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123200339/http://www.derives.net/reviews/review.php?id=1621) of the "Decomposing" fan tribute album - nice to see it's getting out there...


> Once this has been said, “Decomposing” features a lot of successful exercises in style. A few contributors have tried to add beats, keyboards or organ but most of them are completely faithful to the originals. So this is a compilation of irreducible fans of Dean Wareham towards irreducible fans of his songwriting. But there are a few gems.

The [complete album is still available for download](https://static.fullofwishes.co.uk/galaxie_list_tribute/).
