<p>Britta has posted an ad on their <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=23842982&blogID=339189239">MySpace blog</a> for a new keyboard player...as follows	</p>
<blockquote><p>Keyboard player wanted for live shows/touring with Dean & Britta</p>
<p>We're looking for a keyboard player who lives in the NYC area. Someone who can drop everything to run off on tour with us for 2 or 3 weeks at a time. Our touring schedule isn't that heavy, ends up being a couple of months a year.</p>
<p>We're interested in the possibility of using a laptop so we can use sounds from the albums, so experience in this area would be cool. Also would be great to find someone who plays a bit of guitar (simple rhythm stuff), but not necessary.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you,</p>
<p>Britta</p></blockquote>
