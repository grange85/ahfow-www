<p>A bit of old news pinched from <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">Dean & Britta's website</a> that I carelessly missed out. Dean & Britta have designed a T-shirt as part of Playboy's "Rock The Rabbit" campaign. You can buy the cool (if overpriced) T <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.shopthebunny.com/Women+s++RTR+Dean+Britta+Tee+-+Pink/%2012891,default,sp.html;pgid=0000000000000000000000000000ukVXyccp;sid=Bx2S%20jJaYxAOVQ9NgbeGzjpaSx6KXwVYnAlA=?cgid=ROCK40&start=4&sz=1">from the Playboy shop</span> an undisclosed portion of the proceeds goes to an AIDS awareness charity <a href="http://www.lifebeat.org/">LIFEbeat</a>. If you like the T go buy it - if you want to help out the charity I'm sure you'd be better off <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.lifebeat.org/login.cfm/donate/true">supporting them directly</span>!</p>
