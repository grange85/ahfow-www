A bit of old news pinched from [Dean & Britta's web site](http://www.deanandbritta.com) that I carelessly missed out. Dean & Britta have designed a T-shirt as part of Playboy's "Rock The Rabbit" campaign. You can buy the cool (if overpriced) T from the Playboy shop an undisclosed portion of the proceeds goes to an AIDS awareness charity [LIFEbeat](http://www.lifebeat.org/). If you like the T go buy it - if you want to help out the charity I'm sure you'd be better off supporting them directly!
