<p>I think I'll declare <strong>29 August 2007</strong> a holiday - take the day off and tell your boss it's OK because it's Galaxie 500's birthday...</p>
<p>I guess I'm not really in a position to decide at what point Galaxie 500 came into existence, that's a decision better left to the protagonists - but hell they're <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">all busy</a> with <a href="http://www.damonandnaomi.com">more important things</a> - and maybe a 20th anniversary only means something to me. In the booklet that came with <a href="/database/release/galaxie-500-box-set/">the box set</a> Dean mentioned that the point when Naomi decided to pick up the bass guitar was &quot;when the band was born for real&quot;. This was certainly in the summer of 1987 and was before the 11th of August when the three of them went into 6/8 studios in New York City to record their first demo.</p>
<p>But a while back I formed the opinion that a band is truly born when they step on a stage together, until that point they're a bunch of mates playing together. It's when you invite others to judge you that, in my opinion, defines when a band is truly born. That moment for Galaxie 500 happened in a New York City apartment on the 29 August 1987. That the audience were friends, the &quot;stage&quot; was the corner of a living room and the event was a going away party for Dean wasn't important. Opening yourself up to analysis is surely the point at which things get serious.</p>
<p>So, on the 29 August 1987 Dean, Damon &amp; Naomi played &quot;four or five songs&quot; to some friends in an apartment at <a href="/database/show/1987-08-29-galaxie-500-248-front-st-new-york-ny-usa/">248 Front Street in NYC</a> and Galaxie 500 were born.</p>
<p>I suspect the songs played would have included some of the tracks they'd recorded a couple of weeks earlier at that first session. Three songs were recorded at the session and were made into a demo tape that picked up a little airplay on a Harvard radio station and eventually saw the light of day on the &quot;Uncollected&quot; disc of the 1996 Box Set. A very few copies of the demo tape contained four additional tracks that have never been officially released (I'm not sure whether these were recorded at the same NY session).</p>
<p>As far as I'm aware there is no recording of that first show so here are a couple of the unreleased tracks from the <a href="/database/release/demo-cassette-1/">extended Galaxie 500 first demo tape</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;The first ever Galaxie 500 show was during the summer of 1987 at my apartment on Front St. in Manhattan. We played 4 or 5 songs, I can't remember what they were, but I remember being pleased that I didn't break any strings. I was working in the Elmer Holmes Bobst Memorial Library at N.Y.U. Damon & Naomi were in town for the summer, and Naomi had decided to pick up the bass guitar - I guess that's when the band was born for real.&quot;<br/><em>(Dean Wareham - Box set booklet)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Three albums and just under four years later it <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?article_id=47">would all be over</a>.</p>
<p>I had wanted to do some sort of celebration, a party or a gig would have been nice...but I never got my act together. Maybe I'll be better organised for the 25th anniversary...</p>
