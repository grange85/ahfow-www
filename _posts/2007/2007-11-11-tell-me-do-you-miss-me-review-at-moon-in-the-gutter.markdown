[Moon in the Gutter](http://mooninthegutter.blogspot.com) has an excellent in-depth review of **Tell Me Do You Miss Me** Matthew Buzzell's film documenting Luna's last tour.


> The film is also very funny and heartfelt. The four of them aren’t afraid to show emotion, and Buzzell isn’t afraid to show the humorous monotony of a rock band on the road. The film at times plays like a group of friends remembering and telling stories to each other. I really get the feeling from watching this film, that regardless of certain personality clashes, these four people really care about each other. There is a moment towards the end when we see Wareham embrace Eden, and it is incredibly moving and it resonates long after the closing credits.
