[Chimney Rock! Records](http://www.chimneyrocks.org/hescominghome.html) is releasing a new Christmas 7" single by Dean & Britta.

You can pre-order the single now from [Chimney Rocks!](http://www.chimneyrocks.org/HesComingHome7record.Buyitnow..html) for $8 including shipping and the beautiful packaging ($11 international).


<blockquote><p>This 7" single features two wonderful holiday tracks that are sure to complement what ever it is you're celebrating this Season.</p>

On Side A, Dean & Britta cover the old Wailers song, "She's Coming Home," with a slight twist on the title for Britta's snowy sweet vocals.  Beautifully recorded and mixed, it's got that classic Christmas sound that'll have you reaching for the mistletoe and roasting up chestnuts in no time.  Previously unreleased, "He's Coming Home" is sure to brighten those long winter nights.

"Old Toy Trains," on the second side, was recorded a couple years back and posted online in mp3 format, but reemerges now as the perfect B-side track.  With Dean on vocals and guitar, Britta playing bass, & Sonic Boom on the Omnichord, this sparse and delicate Roger Miller remake is certainly a contender for the most trance inducing Christmas song ever.

Each record is housed in a hand silkscreened cover and sleeve.  Design and screenprinting by Pittsburgh's Commonwealth Press, these sleeves display two colors of ink printed on beefy 100 weight French brand paper.  The package complements the music beautifully.  We just saw the finished sleeves this weekend and they have exceeded our every expectation. We couldn't be happier.
