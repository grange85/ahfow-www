<blockquote><p>David Dye hosts Dean & Britta on the World Cafe to play songs from their new album, Back Numbers.  When their 13 year gig with the rock band Luna ended, the guitarist and vocalist debuted as a duo in 2003.  In the midst of composing for film and getting married, the two crafted their sophomore release Back Numbers.  With intimate folk-pop melodies and distinct vocal styles, the album provides a sublime listening experience on original tunes and transforms some surprising covers.</p></blockquote>
