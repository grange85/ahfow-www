<p>Before Dean & Britta there was Cagney and Lacee. Dean Wareham's side project with his then wife Claudia Silver. Over the course of a couple of years they released a couple of singles and <a href="/database/release/six-feet-of-chain-cagney-and-lacee/">an album</a> of cover versions. Borderline was the second single and was released as part of the very lovely <a href="http://www.earwormrecords.com/">Earworm Records</a>' 1998 subscription series. It was a big fat hunk of white vinyl with two tracks on one side at 33 rpm and a platter of nothing on the flip.</p>
<p>Borderline is Dean's first dip into Madonna's catalogue a full five years before Dean & Britta released I Deserve It on L'Avventura - it's a sweet take on the track. The other track on the single "Orange" is the only Silver/Wareham original to get a release before the side project was shelved.</p>
<p>This recording is lifted from my 7" copy and doesn't sound as good as it should but it's the best my kit was willing to offer - if anyone has a better rip please let me know!</p>

<p><em>I normally avoid putting up music that has had a commercial release but as this is long since out of print and is showing no signs of turning up anywhere else I though it deserved to see the light of day</em></p>
