<p>I have to admit that I never really noticed <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?track_id=231">Black Postcards</a> as a stand-out track on Luna's penultimate album <a href="/database/database/discography/luna/152">Romantica</a>. But live, on the band's final tour in 2004/5 the song really came into its own.</p>
<p>This version is from the Friday night show of thier final weekend at The Bowery Ballroom and clocks in at nearly 10 minutes.</p>
