<p>I've just been sorting through my server clearing out some out of the crap and I came across this that I obviosuly threw together in my post Luna haze - I'm not sure whether I ever published it but I guess because it's on the web server I probably did. But just in case I didn't and because it exists and shows just how a sad sack like me fills their idle moments here it is in all it's glory...</p>
