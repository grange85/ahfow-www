Edinburgh band [Ballboy](http://www.ballboymusic.com) are fantastic, and Gordon Ballboy, a big Galaxie 500 fan, does a podcast where he sits in front of his computer with alcohol and a guitar and talks and plays a couple of songs for half an hour. He chats about Galaxie 500 in the most recent one. It probably wouldn't be enough to encourage a Galaxie 500 fan to rush off and download EXCEPT that the podcasts are very good and well worth a listen anyway!

You can subsribe to the podcasts through [iTunes ](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=170065769)or some other podcast software using this feed. You can also download them directly from the bands web site.
