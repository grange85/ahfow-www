<p>Edinburgh band <a href="http://www.ballboymusic.com">Ballboy</a> are fantastic, and Gordon Ballboy, a big Galaxie 500 fan, does a podcast where he sits in front of his computer with alcohol and a guitar and talks and plays a couple of songs for half an hour. He chats about Galaxie 500 in the most recent one. It probably wouldn't be enough to encourage a Galaxie 500 fan to rush off and download EXCEPT that the podcasts are very good and well worth a listen anyway!</p>
<p>You can subsribe to the podcasts through <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=170065769">iTunes </a>or some other podcast software using <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.ballboymusic.com/downloads/RSS_feed.xml">this feed</span>. You can also download them <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.ballboymusic.com/downloads/">directly from the bands website</span>.</p>
