It's been almost excactly a year since I posted the [first track from the Magnetophone](http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?article_id=132) demos, so I guess a reminder is in order. Magnetophone was a short-lived project of Damon & Naomi's after Galaxie 500 split up. The band recorded some demos but nothing was officially released, they (apparently) played a couple of gigs and called it a day. As well as Damon & Naomi the band included Jon Williams ([Volcano Suns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano_Suns)) on guitar and Chris Guttmacher ([Bullet LaVolta](http://web.archive.org/web/20091020114931/http://www.matadorrecords.com:80/bios/bio_bullet.html)) on drums.

This track was labelled "Plane" on the CD I was sent but is actually an early version of [E.T.A.](http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?track_id=128) that would later turn up on Damon & Naomi's first album More Sad Hits.

_This Magnetophone are not the same as the [Magnetophone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetophone) who have released records on 4AD and occasionally feature Spaceman 3's Sonic Boom_
