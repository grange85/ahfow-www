Dean Wareham has just released a cover of Lou Reed's 'A Gift' as a (digital only) single, and you can likely find it on your streaming platform of choice, or... on YouTube here:

{% ahfowvideo "fxGkLmxEvzk" "Dean Wareham - A Gift" %}

The track was produced by Kramer and mixed (and has additional vocals) by Britta.

A demo version of the track had previously been released on a [Patreon only single by PIAPTK](/2025/04/25/new-dean-britta-single-but/) back in April, but Dean points out that he "re-recorded my vocal (with a better microphone and better attitude) and Britta did this re-mix".

It doesn't seem to be available to buy on Dean's Bandcamp but... [keep checking](https://deanwareham.bandcamp.com/music).
