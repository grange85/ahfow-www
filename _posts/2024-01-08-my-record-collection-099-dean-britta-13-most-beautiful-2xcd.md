The first audio release of Dean & Britta's soundtracks for 13 Most Beautiful was this lovely double CD edition that came in a gatefold card sleeve with a booklet. This copy however is still sealed so I can't show off its loveliness.

CD1 of this set does have each of the 13 tracks but in a completely different order to the DVD (and the single disc CD), and live is different again, although much closer to the DVD order.

Recent shows have added a couple of extra screen tests - here's a video of Neon Lights accompanying Donyale Luna's screen test, videoed last year:
