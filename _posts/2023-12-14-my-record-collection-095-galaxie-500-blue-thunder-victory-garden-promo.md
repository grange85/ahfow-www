I must admit that I can't remember the circumstances in which I bemoaned my lack of Galaxie 500 7" singles to Damon and Naomi that prompted them to get me together a beautiful care package, I must have sounded quite pathetic.

I pretty much have now have **everything** that Galaxie 500 put out on a 7" single&dagger; - and most of that is down to that care package. This included.

It's a promo single with Blue Thunder and Victory Garden on the A-side, and Hail by Straitjacket Fits on the flip. That suggests that it was used to promnote the co-headlining Euro tour that Galaxie 500 and Straitjacket Fits were on in 1990.

The single also gets a thumbs up from me for putting two tracks on one side of a 7" single that spins at 45 rpm, like a proper EP should.

 _&dagger; There are some white labels and one sided promos on 7" that I don't have - one of them is currently on Discogs for Â£350 - I'm a pretty big fan... but..._
