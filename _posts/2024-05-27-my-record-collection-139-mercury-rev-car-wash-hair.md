I'm guessing that, since the catalogue number of Mercury Rev's _Car Wash Hair_ was MINT5 and Dean Wareham's _Anesthesia_ was MINT6, that this might have been Dean's first post-Galaxie 500 appearance - although I suspect it passed me by at the time and I think I probably only became aware of Dean's involvement when I started the website in late 1994 and picked up a CD around then.

I love Mercury Rev, but maybe it's my DW bias that makes me think that this is the best thing they ever did!

There's a fab clip of Dean and Britta with Grasshopper and Jonathan playing this live:

I love that the kid seen at the end is providing the missing drums... also that kid is possibly in (or close to) his 20s now! Laura Levine has [some nice photos of the day](http://www.lauralevine.com/mysteryspotvintage.com/?p=1552).

Luna covered Car Wash Hair for A Sentimental Education but (sacrilege alert) I don't think it's as good as the original!
