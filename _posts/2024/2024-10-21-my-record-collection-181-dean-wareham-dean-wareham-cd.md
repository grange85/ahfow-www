This is a CD copy of Dean's lovely self-titled album from 2014, it is still sealed in its plastic wrap since I already had [the LP](/2023/09/28/my-record-collection-073-dean-wareham-dean-wareham/) and this was bought when Sonic Cathedral were having a bit of a sale for the collection.

The CD has a purple version of the sleeve but has all the same fabulous music as the [LP version](/2023/09/28/my-record-collection-073-dean-wareham-dean-wareham/). The album was produced by Jim James of My Morning Jacket.

<blockquote>
Well, I think whatever else you’d say about Jim, I think that the My Morning Jacket albums sound great. He really knows what he’s doing. And his solo album too. I went out to dinner with his manager Mike Martinovich, and I went back to Mike’s office, and he played me some of the album. This was late at night, and I said, “Wow. This sounds great.” And he said, “Well, you and Jim should do something together.” And then it kinda moved quickly from there.

<blockquote>
Jim was very generous, he invited the band [...] into his house in the suburbs of Louisville to make the record, and he let us sleep there too. We set up the drums in the living room, vocal microphone in Jim’s den, and guitar amps in the garage. I’ve never made a record that way before; it was very relaxing. We would play the song through and on many of these songs Jim suggested radical changes in how we approached them. He also played on every song — strange keyboards and electric guitars, so at that point he became the fourth band member.

<blockquote>
Jim’s a good producer. He should do a lot more of it. He’s a positive force to be around. He’s a good musician and has good instincts. Some of the songs would sound very different without his input. We had fun making this record. We recorded it in his house in Kentucky with some very nice equipment. He played the guitar solo on “Babe in the Woods.” He got that fuzz effect by plugging his guitar right into the recording console and cranking it up. That’s how the very first fuzz guitar solo, by Grady Martin on Marty Robbins’ “Don’t Worry,” was recorded. By accident in his case, more or less
