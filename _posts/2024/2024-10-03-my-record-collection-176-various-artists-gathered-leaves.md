In 1998 Ptolemaic Terrascope moved from giving away a 7" EP with the magazine to a CD and in 2016 this LP, that collected a few tracks from the CDs, was released and featured Damon & Naomi with Kurihara's Eye of the Storm as previously available on the [Song to the Siren](/database/damon-and-naomi/releases/song-to-the-siren/) fake live album.

The idea behind this compilation was to enshrine some of the material previously only available digitally on a format worthy of it's legacy status.

... although Eye of the Storm had already been on a "format worthy of its legacy status" having been released on vinyl as part of the [1001 Nights](/database/damon-and-naomi/releases/song-to-the-siren/#1001-nightsftf-002) set in 2009. Initially I had wondered whether this might be the [Playback Singers](/database/damon-and-naomi/releases/playback-singers/) version, which _still hasn't been released on a format worth of its legacy status_ but obv that had no Kurihara so couldn't be.

Damon & Naomi's track had originally been on the CD that came with issue 31 of Ptolemaic Terrascope in 2001, more on that later of course!

The whole LP is a treat with contributions from the sort of Terrascopic mix of familiar names, and complete unknowns you'd expect.
