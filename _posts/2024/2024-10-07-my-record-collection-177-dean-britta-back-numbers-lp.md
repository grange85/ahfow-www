Dean & Britta's second album, from 2007, didn't get a vinyl release until Danish indie Wouldn't Waste put out this lovely _wine_ coloured LP in 2019 - obviously red wine, so... purple.

The track listing has been slightly shuffled I guess to accommodate putting the tracks on two sides of vinyl - I sort of assumed that even in the age of CDs albums would have been sequenced in two halves... but I guess that was just my imagination (running away with me). The Sun is Still Sunny has been moved to the end of side one, and works perfectly well there.

The album came with an insert that has the lovely _doodled_ insert, well it looks doodled to me, although during a particularly long phone call? Also it has crows, and [I love crows](https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/albums/72177720312280310/) - the insert had been in the CD but folded up so it's good to have it in a good size and without creases!

The album is of course beautiful, it seems to be overshadowed by, or overlooked because of, L'avventura but it is, I think, a much more _whole_ album than that one - I do love both albums but this is better, and is the one that makes me wish for another Dean & Britta album - it's been seventeen years ffs - and no, 13 Most Beautiful and Mistress America don't count as D&B albums, lovely though they are, they are soundtracks and not _proper_ albums. Maybe the upcoming Xmas album will scratch that itch?
