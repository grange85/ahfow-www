This is an audience recording of Luna at The Knitting Factory in NYC on the 14th July 2000, the note next to this in my catalogue spreadsheet says "average quality bootleg, not digitised" - I think _average_ is being a little generous. I pondered digitising it anyway but decided it wasn't worth my effort.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/luna-knitting-factory-july-2000-mc.jpg" "Listening to Luna live at The Knitting Factory" %}

Just to add another reason for not digitising this show is that it was one of the source shows recorded _properly_ for [Luna Live](/database/luna/releases/luna-live/) - and this being from the 14th of July, Bastille Day, this show is the source of Dean's "I support the French Revolution" intro on that album. 

Of course one of the quirks of the live album is that what you're listening to on the record is possibly not what really happened! On the album Dean does that speech between _Anesthesia_ and _Tiger Lily_ which are, according to the sleeve, tracks that Justin played on - but this show was one of the shows recorded after Justin had left the band, so Britta was on stage when Dean was speaking, and Justin was about 9,000 miles away!

The banter happens after _Superfreaky Memories_ and before _Tiger Lily_, and there's a bit more French Revolution banter after Moon Palace

Here's the full setlist from the show:

 - Chinatown
 - Four Thousand Days
 - Sideshow by the Seashore
 - Rhythm King
 - Pup Tent
 - Dear Diary
 - Superfreaky Memories
 - \["I support the French Revolution"\]
 - Tiger Lily
 - Friendly Advice
 - Moon Palace
 - \["Wasn't there a revolution in 1968 as well? ... kind of failed"\]
 - Into the Fold
 - 23 Minutes in Brussels
 - \[encore 1\]
 - Bonnie and Clyde
 - \[encore 2\]
 - Fourth of July
 - \[encore 3\]
 - Indian Summer

I've no idea who sent me this, as usual if it was you, thanks? It sounds like it was a great show, although better listening to what you can on [Luna Live](/database/luna/releases/luna-live/)!
