When I posted about the CD version of Guitarrorists back near the beginning of this series (18 months ago!) I was rather casually dismissive of it, just saying that I don't listen to it much and clearly didn't really have the inclination to post much more than that. This time round I felt I should try harder...

... but, it's hard work - too much of it is lacking in melody and beauty, too much of it sound like _exercises_ or _experiments_ and therefore are a little hard on the ears. I tried, and a few beauties do sneak in, but not enough and even some of the nicer ones overstay their welcome - I can just about tolerate a 90 second experiment but any that are over three minutes are trying my patience.

I didn't think to take notes as I listened so, I guess I need to listen to it again to identify the ones I liked. That'll be me listening to the whole thing three times in 18 months, more times than the 30 years previously I suspect!

Here are a few that I rather liked - there may be others... but not that many!

 - I Really Can't Say - Kathy Korniloff
 - Mariposa - Marc Gentry
 - West Broadway - Dean Wareham
 - Dark Field - Nick Saloman
 - Here - Lee Ranaldo (although at five and a half minutes it's way too long!)

The LP does however earn points however for being in a gatefold sleeve and therefore has sleeve notes and credits that are actually big enough to read - here's what it says about Dean's contribution:

<blockquote>
<em>Dean Wareham</em> has traded in the galaxie 500 for a clean, quiet electric car and enrolled in an abnormal psych. course at n.y.u.
</blockquote>

... nope, me neither!

I also discovered, as I slid out the record from my collection that the spine gives the album a longer title - _Guitarrorists = Player + Instrument_ (I went and checked the CD spine but that only gave the album a one word title).

As a bonus of something sweeter - here are the short guitar workouts of familiar tunes that Dean provided to Swart Amps back in 2007
