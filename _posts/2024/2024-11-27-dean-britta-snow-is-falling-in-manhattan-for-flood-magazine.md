<blockquote>
<p>When David Berman's Purple Mountains record came out in the summer of 2019, I emailed David to tell him how much I loved the album and 'Snow is Falling in Manhattan' in particular," Wareham recounts. "He said he’d put me on the list for his upcoming show at the Lodge Room (in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles): 'I have one person on my list for LA—I don’t know anyone!'</p>

<p>"We were stunned when he took his life just a few weeks later, and his whole album suddenly read like a long goodbye note. Now it’s November 2024, Britta and I are staying with friends in Highland Park, and we shot this video in their backyard. You can hear the sounds of water in their pond. It’s a long way from a snowy Saturday in Manhattan but that’s what the holidays are like out here."</p>
