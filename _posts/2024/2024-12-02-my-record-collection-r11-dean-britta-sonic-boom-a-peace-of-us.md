So, after 20 years of Dean (and Britta, and Sonic Boom) slowly building a catalogue of Christmas songs, their Christmas album has finally arrived, and what a beauty it is.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/dean-britta-sonic-boom-a-peace-of-us-xmas.jpg" "Dean & Britta & Sonic Boom - A Peace of Us" %}

"20 years!?" I hear you say.

Yes, it was in December 2004 that Dean emailed me an mp3 of "Old Toy Trains":

<blockquote>
<p>Andy,</p>
<p>I am attaching a song I thought you might want to put up on your site
as a giveaway:</p>
<p>Old Toy Trains (Roger Miller)<br/>
performed by Dean Wareham, Britta Phillips and Sonic Booom<br/>
Mixed by Sonic Boom</p>
<p>We're going to put it up on the Luna site too.</p>
<p>All the best,<br>
Dean</p>
</blockquote>

... and since then there has been a fairly regular trickle of Xmassy goodness from Dean...

 - 2004 - Dean & Britta and Sonic Boom released ["Old Toy Trains"](/2017/12/15/xmas-countdown-3-dean-warehams-xmas-gifts/) as a download via Fuzzywuzzy and AHFoW.
 - 2006 - Sonic Boom did a [remix of "Old Toy Trains"](/2017/12/15/xmas-countdown-3-dean-warehams-xmas-gifts/) and it is once again shared digitally.
 - 2007 - ["Old Toy Trains" / "He's Coming Home"](/2023/12/21/my-record-collection-097-old-toy-trains-hes-coming-home/) got a vinyl release on Chimney Rocks! records.
 - 2014 - Dean did an Aquarium Drunkard "Lagnapipe session" with "Christmas Can't Be Far Away" and ["Stille Nacht"](https://youtu.be/3auutZ0njng).
 - 2017 - Dean & Britta and Sonic Boom released ["Little Altar Boy"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Altar-Boy-Sonic-Boom/dp/B0771BKTKV) for "Home for The Holidays" an Amazon digital album.
 - 2019 - Dean covered ["Snow is Falling in Manhattan"](https://soundcloud.com/section26/dean-wareham-snow-is-falling-in-manhattan) for a David Berman tribute album.
 - 2020 - Dean & Britta did a gorgeous Instgram Live performance of ["Do You Know How Christmas Trees Are Grown"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mgMlLoxcU0)
 - 2020 - Dean & Britta did a Christmas live stream that includes ["Happy Xmas (War is Over)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKzbZ3KcuuI), all of the above... and more.

So, it was no surprise to hear early in 2024 that Dean & Britta were working with Sonic Boom on what was to become A Peace of Us.

It is a beautiful LP, I must admit I approached it with some trepidation - I LOVE Christmas and Christmas records so it had to be good to live up to my expectations, not just good actually... better than that! But it is lovely - all the above tracks are included in either re-recordings or remixes (mostly the latter I believe), and all sound special - although the missing "Go Dean!" in "He's Coming Home" still smarts somewhat - particularly as I had just described it as ["one of my absolute fave little bits of Dean & Britta’s recorded output"](/2023/12/21/my-record-collection-097-old-toy-trains-hes-coming-home/)... but it's still a beauty, and I do have the Chimney Rocks! release to go back to... or I can just add the "Go Dean!" myself... which I do!

My copy was the "Christmas splatter" edition released by Rough Trade - I (have so far) resisted also buying the green vinyl copy... but... tempted!!

I do also rather love the sleeve art by Marco Papiro, the way that [the CND symbol](https://cnduk.org/the-symbol/) has been worked into it... because now more than ever Nuclear Disarmament sounds like something [we should be working very hard to achieve](https://cnduk.org/donate/)!
