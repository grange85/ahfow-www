This is a lovely split single released by fab Taiwan based label _Formosa Punk_ in 2014 - one side has Dean covering Robyn Hitchcock's Love and the other has Britta covering Dennis Wilson / The Beach Boys' _Fallin' in Love_

Love later appeared on the digital-only single of The Dancer Disappears which was released around the same time by Sonic Cathedral, there may have been CDR promos of this but I don't have one, so I'm going to call this the **only** physical release of this which makes this a _lost track_:

} %}

I'm a little disappointed that Dean's cover doesn't include the gnomes and Weetabix verse for some reason, mostly because I'd love to hear Dean sing "Weetabix".

Britta's _Fallin' in Love_ later turned up in a very different mix, on Luck or Magic, I think I prefer the single version, it's a little more... gentle:
