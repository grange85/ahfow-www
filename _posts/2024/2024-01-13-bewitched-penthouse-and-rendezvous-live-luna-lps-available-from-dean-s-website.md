Dean Wareham has a few of the limited edition live Luna LPs released by Bandbox last year for sale on his web site. The double LPs will cost $31.99 each, but better be quick since Bandbox have already sold out of the Bewitched and Rendezvous ones so [head to Dean's web site](https://deanwareham.com/luna-items) if you missed out!

These releases are band exclusive editions that are all in clear vinyl rather than the green, white and "whiskey smoke" (that'll be brown) of the regular editions.

If you ordered from Bandbox there was a delay with pressing the Rendezous albums because of a "shortage of brown pellets" (that'll be whiskey smoke pellets), but these have been pressed now and should be on their way soon. It's been a long wait!
