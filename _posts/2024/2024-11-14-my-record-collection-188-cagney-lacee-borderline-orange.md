This is the third, and final, Cagney & Lacee release, put out by Earworm in late 1998. It contains a cover of Madonna's Borderline and the only released original by "Silver / Wareham".

The single is on white vinyl, with a white, unprinted label, it came in a poly bag with a couple of inserts, the one with the titles has a still from the Albert Brooks film "Lost in America" - I didn't know the film, but did recognise Julie Hagerty so a bit of Googling was able to identify it. Written over the top of the film still it declares...

- A = 'Borderline'
- B = 'Orange'

... although both tracks are on one side of the vinyl, so technically I'd say this doesn't have a B-side - and is probably a genuine double A-side!

I've always had rather a soft-spot for Madonna's _Borderline_ since I picked up a radio promo of it (and one of _Lucky Star_) at a sale back around the time it was released. Cagney & Lacee's cover is very sweet, and Claudia's voice really suits the songs sweetness.

The other track has Lacee narrating the story of a girl with "frizzy red hair and retainer" struggling to find her way ... "will I ever?". I hope she did.
