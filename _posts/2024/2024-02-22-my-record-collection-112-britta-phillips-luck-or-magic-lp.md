This is the replacement copy of Luck or Magic that Britta sent me after [my first arrived damaged](/2023/03/27/my-record-collection-020-britta-phillips-luck-or-magic-lp/)

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/britta-luck-or-magic.jpg" "Britta - Luck of Magic" %}

I love that the sleeve doesn't have the artist's name on it, and that it's been signed "Britta" - I love that for this album she's just a first name, like "Cher" or "Madonna"!

I didn't really talk _about_ the album last time so here's a quick track-by-track blast...

<!--more-->

 - __Daydream__ is a track that pre-dates Britta's time with Luna, or perhaps from her early days with Luna, since she had a demo posted on her website in 2000:
{% ahfowaudio {
"audiourl": "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/audio/britta-phillips-00-daydream-demo.mp3",
"audiocap": "Britta Phillips - Daydream (demo, 2000)"
} %}

 - __Do It Last__ has a lovely/strange breathy-keyboard solo going into the bridge.
 - __One Fine Summer Morning__ was [originally recorded by Evie Sands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqLjkU57HF0) for her lovely 1968 album _Any Way That You Want Me_.
 - __Million Dollar Doll__ first turned up on the soundtrack of the Noah Baumbach film _Frances Ha_ as instrumental background music in a bar scene. A vocal version was then included on what seems to be a very rare, promo only, soundtrack album credited to Dean & Britta - I scrounged a copy of the track from Britta:
{% ahfowaudio {
"audiourl": "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/audio/dean-and-britta-million-dollar-doll.mp3",
"audiocap": "Dean & Britta - Million Dollar Doll",
"sourceurl": "https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2013/06/20/new-dean-britta-track-on-the-frances-ha-soundtrack/",
"sourcecap": "Music From The Motion Picture Frances Ha"
} %}
> It was quite a last minute request to have the song on the soundtrack so it's kind of a rough mix. I still might put it on my solo "thing." Maybe give it a fresh mix.

 - I was never a fan of [The Cars version of __Drive__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuZA6qiJVfU) and then its use during Live Aid didn't help with that, so I wasn't too sure what to make of Britta's cover. I like it but it's still tainted by the original.
 - __Fallin' in Love__ was originally by [Dennis Wilson (and called "Lady")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsevrVoJE-g). Britta had previously released a version on a [split single with Dean Wareham's _Love_](/database/dean-wareham/releases/singles/#loveshade-017) on the other side by Formosa Punk in 2014. 
 - Britta revealed that __Luck or Magic__ "borrowed chords from Cosmic Dancer" which gives me a chance to [link to T.Rex's original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=524swxaTJ1c),  T.Rex were my first pop music love when I was a pre- and early-teen - and I still love them to pieces!
 - __Landslide__ was written by Stevie Nicks and first [recorded for Fleetwood Mac's 1975 eponymous album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM7-PYtXtJM).
 - __Wrap Your Arms Around Me__ was originally [by ex-Abba member Agnetha Faltskog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQBU1zgxc-A) and on her first English language solo album (also called Wrap Your Arms Around Me). Britta sings _fake-Swedish_ in the song.
 - __Ingrid Superstar__ has "guitar swells" by Luna's Sean Eden.
