This was a split single with F&uuml;xa from 2011 released on fab UK indie (and long time F&uuml;xa champions) Rocket Girl in 2011.

Crystal Blue RIP was originally released on Dean & Britta's second album Back Numbers in 2007, this remix seems to rather play down the strings that made the album version so special so I do prefer that one to this - not to say that this isn't an interesting take on the track.

I can't find a version of the remix on the Internet, Randall of F&uuml;xa has [put a remix on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/fuxa/dean-and-britta-crystal-blue-rip-fuxa-remix) but it's not the one on the single.

The other side of the single has a [lovely cover of The Go-Go's _Our Lips are Sealed_](https://fuxa1.bandcamp.com/track/our-lips-are-sealed) with Sarah Peacock of Seefeel on vocals.
