This is the promo CD of Romantica that Dean sent me ahead of release, it comes in a simple card sleeve with the same cover as the released version but with the statement "Promotional copy. Not for sale." printed along the bottom. The reverse has the track listing at the top, and the words "Spring 2002" in the centre.

I also recieved, I guess at the same time, [a handful of stickers with the Romantica artwork](/2019/06/28/artefacts-004-romantica-sticker/), one was signed by Dean for my son, he was four at the time so I _looked after it_ for him... I still am looking after it.

I still don't listen to Romantica as much as the other albums, although this is the third (and not the last) time for [this series](/category/my-record-collection).

I like the story behind _Renee is Crying_...

<blockquote>
Renee, our ex-manager, was annoyed about this song title. She felt sure that people would think the song was about her, But it wasn't. I had clipped a story from a back issue of <em>Life</em> magazine that I found at a flea market, a story about astronauts' wives. Scott was an astronaut, and Renee <em>(sic)</em> was his wife. The <em>Life</em> magazine headline read AS SCOTT GOES UP... RENEE IS CRYING.

I'm guessing it must be [this issue of Life](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BlIEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&pg=PA1&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) but I can't find the headline quote Dean mentions but here is Rene, as Scott goes up, and she does look like she might be crying!?

From my brief bit of Googling Rene seems to have been an interesting woman, here's her [obit from The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/us/rene-carpenter-dead.html).

Since there haven't been enough cat pics in the series here's our much missed Penny posing with some Romantica promo material
