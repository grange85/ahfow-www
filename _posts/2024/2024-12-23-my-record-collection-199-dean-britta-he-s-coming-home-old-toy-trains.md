This is a black vinyl copy of Dean & Britta's lovely Christmas single put out by Chimney Rocks! back in 2007. I wrote about an un-numbered [blue vinyl copy](/2023/12/21/my-record-collection-097-old-toy-trains-hes-coming-home/) last Christmas. This one however has a number 480/500.

Both of these tracks have recently reappeared on [A Peace of Us](https://deanandbritta.bandcamp.com/album/a-peace-of-us) the fab Xmas album from Dean & Britta and Sonic Boom, although of course this version of He's Coming Home still has the "Go Dean!" that was bafflingly removed for A Peace of Us.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Allison</b>:	the quarantine shows were beyond special. and hey, where was the "go Dean!" in this version?</p>
<p><b>Andy</b>:	Did I miss the "Go Dean"!???</p>
<p><b>Dean & Britta</b>:	we took out "Go Dean", you can say it yourself each time!</p>
<p><b>Andy</b>:	That "Go Dean!" is about my favourite xmassy thing ever!!</p>

Since I've already written about [the (blue vinyl) single](/2023/12/21/my-record-collection-097-old-toy-trains-hes-coming-home/) in this series, and the two songs in the [originals](/category/originals/) series I guess I'm pretty much all out of words for this... and, since this is the eve of Christmas Eve I guess I'll just post some completely unrelated Christmas nonsense :)

Five reasons I love xmas - even though I'm not religious!

#1 - Because my mum loved it - even though she _was_ religious!  

#2 - Foooood - I love so much xmas food - Brussels sprouts, cheese, mince pies, nuts, roasties, etc.

#3 - Scrooge, the musical with Albert Finney  
{% ahfowvideo "Dkq7WZTzkLQ" "Thank You Very Much (from Scrooge)" %}

#4 - Most Christmas pop songs of the 70s - here's one of my faves (but not [the one I'd be expected to post](/2024/12/17/simply-having-a-wonderful-christmastime-an-explanation/))
{% ahfowvideo "IJPc7esgvsA" "Wizzard - I Wish it Could be Christmas Everyday" %}

#5 - These folk

... and since it's been over a year without a Motorhead reference&dagger;

Have a lovely xmas, if you celebrate, and a lovely few days doing whatever makes you happiest if you don't. _My record collection_ is having a week off and will be back on New Year's Eve.
