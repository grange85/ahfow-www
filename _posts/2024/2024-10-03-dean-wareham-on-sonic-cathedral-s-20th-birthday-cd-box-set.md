Fab London indie Sonic Cathedral are currently celebrating 20 years and as part of that are releasing a lovely [CD box set](https://soniccathedral.bandcamp.com/merch/celebrate-yourself-the-sonic-cathedral-story-2004-2024-limited-edition-4cd-box-set-scr320box) "telling the story of Sonic Cathedral from 2004 to the present day" and Dean Wareham playing Galaxie 500's "When Will You Come Home" is featured on the CD of live recordings.

The recording is from Dean's great shows at St Pancras Old Church in 2013 and was previously available on cassette and on the LP released last year, but this is the first outing on CD.

The set also has three tracks from Cheval Sombre and lots more unrelated but still brilliant tracks. The collection is divided into four sections, classics, remixes, lives, and xmassy and is well worth getting your hands on.

Bandcamp sold out pretty quickly but you can still pre-order the collection from your record shop of choice - [this page has links to some places to try](https://soniccathedral.bandcamp.com/merch/celebrate-yourself-the-sonic-cathedral-story-2004-2024-limited-edition-4cd-box-set-scr320box).
