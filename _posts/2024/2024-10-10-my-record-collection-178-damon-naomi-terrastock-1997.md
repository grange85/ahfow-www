This is a recording of the Damon & Naomi's set at the first Terrastock festival in Providence, RI in April 1997. The tape was made by, and sent to me shortly after the show, by the much missed Tom Rapp.

I'm not 100% certain that the note is the one that accompanied the cassette, although I think it must have been:

<blockquote>
<p>Hello Andy,</p>
<p>I hope you like these. I let D&N know that you might stop by when they play London.</p>
<p>Yrs,</p>
<p>Tom Rapp (and Lynn Madison & Harry, the dog formerly known as "Prince")</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Note from Tom Rapp, 1997</p>

Damon & Naomi played at the 12 Bar in October so it all seems about right, the only puzzler is the use of _"these"_ in the note but I guess there was something else in the envelope that I've since forgotten about? I do also have a recording of Tom playing with Shy Camp (which was his son David's band) so maybe that was the other?

The recording is lovely, for lots of reasons, one of the odd ones is that you can hear the sound of a _proper_ camera being wound on which adds to the charm and the wonderfully analog nature of Terrastock/Terrascope.

The set opens with the beautiful Spirit of Love, that had just appeared on a [Ptolemaic Terrascope covermount EP](/2024/09/19/my-record-collection-172-the-complete-sepia-carrot-ep/), proceeds through a gorgeous set of early D&N, before finishing with a cover of Tom Rapp's Translucent Carriages, and then Tom joining them to play Dylan's I Shall be Released (that was released on a Terrastock souvenir CD a while later).

There's a lovely video clip of Damon & Naomi playing The New Historicism, and then I Shall Be Released with Tom. I sadly never got to see Tom live, a scheduling change and childcare responsibilities meant I missed his set at Terrastock London in 1999 (although I was lucky enought to [have a lovely chat with him after D&N's set](/2018/02/12/tom-rapp-1947-2018/)).

During Tom's set at the first Terrastock he played a cover of Damon & Naomi's _Tour of The World_:
