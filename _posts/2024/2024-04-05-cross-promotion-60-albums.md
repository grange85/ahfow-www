Apologies for a bit of cross promotion. Next month I'll reach 60 and since the beginning of the year over on my personal blog [Everything's Swirling](https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling) I've been posting about an album from every year of my life (the series is called [60 albums](https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/category/60-albums) but of course, there'll be 61 becuase... artithmetic!

The intention was to try and be a bit daring and experimental but it has now reached the 90s and has become a full on indie fest, because it's what I find it easiest to witter on about.

It's not entirely without AHFoW relevance of course, because all roads lead to Galaxie 500! I've snuck relevant content into...

- [1989 - Madonna - Like a Prayer](https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2024/03/13/60-albums-1989-madonna-like-a-prayer/)
- [1995 - Luna - Penthouse](https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2024/03/31/60-albums-1995-luna-penthouse/)
- [1996 - Nord Express](https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2024/04/04/60-albums-1996-nord-express/)

... and there'll almost certainly be more.

I'm pretty certain I could have got AHFoW relevance into every post - sort of wish I'd tried that! But still, you can get a little insight into what makes me tick, and get a tour through the phases of my musical progression (pop, rock, metal, folk, etc.)

- I'm also picking the 50 best singles between 1954 and 1976 - [#LET5D0IT](https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/category/let5d0it/)
