Having already posted about two copies of the Mistress America soundtrack we come to the two copies on LP.

I can't remember where I bought the first of these, I think from some online retailer overseas, but I can't find the email evidence of that, but it did arrive rather creased, evidence that somewhere in the postal system it had been seriously manhandled. The record itself had, fortunately, survived unharmed and because of that, and because I couldn't be bothered the hassle of returning it I just resigned myself to having a creased copy.

Three or four years later I [posted a picture on Instgram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtNi4QqA1YL/) of the LP and commented on its rather shabby state, mostly to convince folk that I'm not really that careless with my record collection... even if I sometimes am!

<strong>@fullofwishes</strong>: Mistress America - Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips (Milan 2015) - my copy arrived rather battered by the postal system<br>
 > <strong>@britta_phillips</strong>: That sucks! How does it sound?<br>
 >> <strong>@fullofwishes</strong>: sounds fine and happened three or four years ago now, so I've almost got over it!</p>

A few weeks later another copy arrived unannounced, in pristine condition, and with Dean and Britta's autographs in gold on the front sleeve!

The soundtrack is credited to _Dean Wareham & Britta Phillips_ - the third from of credit, having already been _Britta Phillips & Dean Wareham_ for L'avventura and Sonic Souvenirs, and _Dean & Britta_ for most of the rest of their output.
