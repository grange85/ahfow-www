Playback Singers was Damon & Naomi's third album, released on Sub Pop in the US and Rykodisc in Europe. This is a rarity in the series (possibly unique) in being a studio album by one of the main acts that only appears once. That is because sadly, Playback Singers has never had a vinyl release (and I never got sent, or bought, a promo - although there is one on Discogs atm...

Playback Singers was the first album Damon and Naomi recorded without Kramer at the helm, it was recorded in their home studio - they had initially been uncertain about the feasibility of that:

<blockquote>
...when [Masaki] Batoh from Ghost first visited us, he stepped in the living room, clapped his hands to hear the echo and said, 'I want to record here!' At the time we thought it was a charming but unrealistic idea...

Everything on Playback Singers was played and recorded by Damon and/or Naomi in their living room "for an audience consisting solely of their cat (and even she mysteriously disappeared during the recording of the drum tracks)".

The album's title Playback Singers is a reference to the artists who perform the soundtrack in Indian cinema - they are never seen on the screen, having the actors lip-sync to the songs - but, unlike in western cinema, they are always credited which means that they are as much stars and household names as the on-screen talent.

On the promo website for the album Damon & Naomi wrote about listening to Indian music while making the album:

<blockquote>
As our new album title might indicate, we have been listening to a lot of Indian movie music lately, especially from the 1950s and 60s -- there is a multi-volume history from EMI called "Play Back: the 50 Melodious Years," with enough melody for at least the entire century. Among the women singers perhaps we love Asha Bhosle best, and among the men Mahendra Kapoor. He is very suave. They sing duets on many tracks, including our most favorite soundtrack (with music by Ravi), "Gumrah." We asked a Hindi speaker what this title means, and he said, "Sadness." No wonder! 
</blockquote>

Here's Mahendra Kapoor and Asha Bhosle singing while Sunil Dutt and Mala Sinha are on screen:

I have grown up watching Indian cinema, my mum was Anglo-Indian and raised in Calcutta/Kolkata until she moved to the UK when she was 20... although I must admit to only gaining an appreciation of it in my later adulthood.

Despite the many years of exposure I haven't actually seen too much, but here's one of my fave songs/performances from Indian cinema this from the cracking 1956 crime thriller C.I.D. - it features actor Johnny Walker lip-synching to Mohammed Rafi and Kumkum lip-synching to Geeta Dutt

I'm not sure there is a great deal of Indian classical music influence on Playback Singers... except perhaps Naomi's use of the [Sruti box]():
