<p>OK, horrified as I am that I didn't manage to post the first review of this show on my own mailing list - here's my view of events... </p>
<p>Arrived shortly before Cornershop - so I missed the first band too. </p>
<p>Last time I saw Cornershop I was converted - I'd never really been a fan but that night I was moved - then I discovered that \"Woman's Gotta Have It\" is a pretty good album - and since then they've released what is a serious challenger for album of the year with \"When I Was Born...\". </p>
<p>But last night I was disappointed - they just never seemed to get going - \"WOG\" and \"Good Ship\" were only average and \"Brimful of Asha\" should have been great but barely got me bobbing, a pretty good closing \"Jullander Shere\" almost saved the day but I know they can do better. </p>
<p>The crowd noticeably thinned for Luna - but it was still probably the biggest and most enthusiastic crowd I'd seen at one of their shows, and tonight they rocked - they seem to be getting a much harder edge to their sound of late - \"Time to Quit\" positively buzzed, and even \"California\" seemed like the evil brother of the song that's been gracing American Express TV adverts over here. </p>
<p>They closed the main set with a glorious IHOP (the studio version seems so much better having heard it live), and enccored with \"Chinatown\" and (of course) an amazing \"Indian Summer\" - I keep thinking that one day I'll get bored with them doing \"Indian Summer\" live - but after last night I'm not sure I ever will. </p>
<p>After last years discussions that Luna were perhaps becoming a touch formulaic live, this show managed to blow that theory right out of the water. </p>
<p>The evening's only down side was only the songs they didn't play - we weren't treated to a Galaxie number, and there were a stack of my faves that didn't get played - but I guess when you have four albums (plus the Galaxie 500 back catalogue) to draw on you've got to accept that there will be disappointing omissions. </p>
<p>(although they could have played longer!) </p>
