I'm not sure at what point cassettes became part of something that I collected, and can't actually remember when this copy of Luna's first LP came into my posession... but here it is, the third different Lunapark format in [_my record collection_](/category/my-record-collection).

My cassette collecting is still a little half-arsed - there are just 21 cassettes in my collection, and only seven of those were released. This is one.

Rather lazily the artwork, rather than being re-designed for the cassette box is just rotated and squished to the appropriate size like it just wasn't important... it _still_ doesn't look like a pencil sharpener though!

The inside of the sleeve has, like the CD, a circle with a bit of the Kim Novak plate (is it a plate?) that can be seen in full on the [Smile EP](/2024/12/05/my-record-collection-194-luna-smile-ep/), however it's a different bit of Kim. On the Elektra CD and the Summershine LP release bits of Kim can also be seen on the back of the sleeve, and for the [deluxe LP release](/2024/08/01/my-record-collection-158-luna-lunapark-deluxe-2xlp/) Kim is ditched completely despite having a gatefold sleeve and an insert to play with.

A few idle thoughts/observations:

 - The album is credited to Luna<sup>2</sup> - the <sup>2</sup> was removed for the [deluxe re-release](/2024/08/01/my-record-collection-158-luna-lunapark-deluxe-2xlp/) which I think is sort of a shame.
 - The cassette has the [forwards guitar solo](/2011/11/11/audio-i-want-everything-back-and-forth/).
 - Kramer plays on a couple of tracks despite not being behind the mixing desk.
 - Mercury Rev's Grasshopper plays on three tracks.
