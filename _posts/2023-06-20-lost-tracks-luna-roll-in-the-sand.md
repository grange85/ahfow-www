Roll in the Sand was released as the b-side of Luna's cover of Wire's Outdoor Miner on Spanish label Radiation in 1996 ... and then disappeared until it was hauled out for the extra LP that was included in the Long Players 92-99 box set in 2016.

A track that I'd mostly forgotten, maybe it is easily forgettable? With its gentle, pedestrian amble and its langurous guitar, although it is capable of worming its way inside - I listen to it rarely but know it very well.

__Update:__  
_I just noticed that I'd  [already posted this back in 2012](/2012/10/02/audio-lost-tracks-luna-roll-in-the-sand/)... and did a much better job of it then too!_
