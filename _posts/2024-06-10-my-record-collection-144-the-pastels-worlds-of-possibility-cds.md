Back when I wrote about [The Pastels album Mobile Safari](/2024/03/18/my-record-collection-119-the-pastels-mobile-safari-cd/) I said that "there are no clues as to what songs Dean can be heard on and since the album has SEVEN people credited as playing guitar on the album Iâ€™m not ready to take any guesses" - but thanks to this single I think we can assume that one of the tracks Dean can be heard on is Worlds of Possibility.

Gerry Love also gets a credit, and there are three other, non-album, tracks on here so... who knows?
