Luna's Romantica, along with Rendezvous, was re-pressed on vinyl in 2016 as part of a Pledgemusic campaign. This is my Pledgemusic copy, signed by all four members of the band.

Back in 2016 [Dean Wareham ranked Luna's studio albums](/2016/05/12/dean-wareham-ranks-lunas-studio-albums/) and put Romantica a lowly fifth out of seven saying "There was so much going on in my life at that point, it's kind of hard for me to think about this record objectively." - at the time I decided to rank Luna's albums too and put it at sixth, so neither of us rated it amongst Luna's finest. Listening to it now I find it hard to believe because it sounded so much better than that - although still not entirely sure what it would overtake.

My last.fm plays mostly agree with my rankings from 2016, except for some reason Pup Tent is way down the list - I can only think I listen to it more on vinyl and therefore it doesn't (always) get scrobbled.

_Here are my most played Luna albums according to Last.fm (with my 2016 rankings in parentheses)_
1. Penthouse (1)
2. Lunapark (2)
3. Bewitched (4)
4. Rendezvous (5)
5. Romantica (6)
6. Pup Tent (3)
7. Days of Our Nights (7)
