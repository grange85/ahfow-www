'The Cassette Converter' over on YouTube has just posted a [video of Galaxie 500 at their last London date at ULU in 1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psk0ncyGtdE&t=225s). This is the same source that was released on the [Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste DVD]() a few years back, and while the quality isn't as good it does contain two additional songs that never made it onto the DVD.

The [better quality version from the DVD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyE2yVDq_f0) has also been put on YouTube.
