My first/primary copy of Luna's Pup Tent was on CD, this LP was bought later, although I can't remember (or find any clues in my email) of how much later.

Pup Tent was the second Luna LP made during the lifetime of the Mailing List and was the first to receive _mixed_ reviews on the list...

<blockquote>
Holy disappointment. I just received an advance of Pup Tent. I am praying
to the music Gods that this is just a sick joke and that I will soon fall
madly in love with this album. So far, it is not even a small case of puppy
love.

<blockquote>
Okay, a lot of people have been voicing some negative first impressions about
pup tent. And no, it isn't the Luna we've grown accustomed to over the last
three albums, but at least they've stopped playing it safe. You can't knock
the band for doing something different.

Well I got pup tent, as usual I first thought, "not as good as the
last". Then I played it in the car; more like wearing headphones as
opposed to background music for when I am cleaning, cooking or just
beating my meat etc.. As has happened in the past I like it more with
each listen, remembering some of the songs from live shows; where luna
really shines

Pup Tent was a nice pop record and Dean did a nice tour
behind it, but it does not thave the passion that I
associate with G500 and even the very early Luna stuff.

In retrospect, now that we're so familiar with the songs, it's odd to think of Pup Tent as being something _"different"_ or it not being _"the Luna we've grown accustomed to"_...

I'm listening to it now, trying to imagine never hearing it before and it is starting to make sense. IHOP as an album opener feels almost like a _challenge_ to the Luna faithful, it really isn't what we had come to expect from Luna up until then. Beautiful View too, sounded more _out there_ than I realised, and then the vocoder on Pup Tent might have been too much for some? Bobby Peru maybe gets us onto firmer Luna ground, and Tracy I Love You, opening side two, is the most _Luna_ track on the album, although, now we know that Tracy... was first recorded in the Penthouse sessions maybe _that's_ the album's outlier?

Funnily enough I'm pretty sure that I didn't have any concerns at the time. I remember someone emailing me before I had heard it, warning me that I might be surprised, but I don't think I ever didn't love the album, and "Tracy I Love You" and "Fuzzy Wuzzy" are right near the top of my favorite Luna songs. I put Pup Tent at #3 when [I ranked Luna's albums](/2016/05/12/dean-wareham-ranks-lunas-studio-albums/) (Dean put it at #4), and I'd stand by it now. Although, listening to it right now, I might even rank it higher. It _is_ a great album and _is_ most definitely a Luna album.

In Black Postcards Dean dedicates a whole chapter to the making of Pup Tent, the chapter is titled "Don't You Like Making Records?" - the making of the album was hard work but, damn! It was worth it.
