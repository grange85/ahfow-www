I guess it's inevitable that there are going to be entries in this series about which I know very little, and this single by The Bartlebees is one. Dean Wareham guests on the second track on the b-side, _In My Box_.

So here's a few things I do know:

<!--more-->

 - The picture on the front is a fab photo of Twiggy&dagger; riding a scooter, taken in 1967 by Ronald Traeger.
 - Armin of The Bartelbees gets some background filled out in Dean's Black Postcards so we know more about him than the other members, namely:
   - He is a postman
   - He is a _Donaldist_ - a member of DONALD (Deutsche Organisation Nichtkommerzieller Anh&auml;nger des Lauteren Donaldismus / German organisation for the non-commercial devotees of true Donaldism)
   - That _Donald_ is the duck!
   - He had "a huge collection of seven inch singles"
 - The single is described on the sleeve as _Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - The Bartlebees in Arlo Bumfluffs' So Long, and Thanks For All The Fish!_
 - "So long, and thanks for all the fish" is the last message the dolphins leave before departing the earth shortly before it gets demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass&Dagger;.
 - Dean's credit on the sleeve is "Dean Wareham as Fuzzy on leadguitar & backing vocals B2"

The single was recorded in April 1998 and released on Magic Marker Records from Portland, Oregon.

Here's the track Dean guests on...

 _&dagger; - I'm not sure how well Twiggy is known beyond the UK but she was a skinny model in the 60s and the face of M&S now_
