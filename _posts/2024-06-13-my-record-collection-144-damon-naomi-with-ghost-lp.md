My first (non promo) copy of Damon & Naomi with Ghost would have been [the CD](/2023/10/02/my-record-collection-074-damon-naomi-with-ghost-cd/) and I happily lived with that as my primary copy for many years. In late 2011 Drag City announced a re-release of the album with a bonus 7" single containing a cover of The Velvet Underground's Femme Fatale which had previously only been available on the Japanese CD release of the album. This was clearly enough to convince me I needed another copy of this album.

I'm unlikely to say this very often in this series but the CD package is nicer than the LP. Whereas the CD came in a lovely, glossy tri-fold, full colour card sleeve, the LP had the same pics (but bigger obviously) on the back and front, but the rest of the sleeve content was only included on a flimsy, washed out, insert, rather than on the nice thick gatefold sleeve it so obviously deserved! Having said that it is still probably my favourite Damon & Naomi sleeve - the photography, typography and layout are lovely but on the LP could/should be lovelier!

The bonus single came in a plain bag but does have a rather beautiful picture of a wood-carving on the b-side label to make up for that.

Femme Fatale was recorded with Ghost in the sessions for the album and the b-side, an English language cover of Kazuki Tomokawa's _Watashi No Nana_ was recorded live in Tokyo in 2004 with Michio Kurihara on guitar and Taishi Takizawa on flute. I love hearing woodwind on rock and roll records!
