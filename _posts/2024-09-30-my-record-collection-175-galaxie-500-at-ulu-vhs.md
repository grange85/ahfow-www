The last time I saw Galaxie 500 was a [beautiful show at ULU](/database/galaxie-500/shows/galaxie-500-1990-11-15-ulu-london-uk/) on the 15th November 1990, the following weekend I saw a video bootleg of the show at Camden market... and didn't buy it - something I regretted for many years until someone sent me this one.

Back in 2003 Damon got in touch with me asking if I had any videos of Galaxie 500 and if I could put out a call on the website and mailing list to see if anyone had any... I sent in this one, and a few other list members sent in tapes as well. In May 2004 a very lovely [2xDVD set of Galaxie 500 videos](/database/galaxie-500/releases/miscellaneous/#don-t-let-our-youth-go-to-waste) was released that included this show - I suspect it wasn't lifted from my VHS, although I don't currently have a VCR hooked up at the moment so I can't remind myself of the quality.

Damon eventually returned the VHS - the label now read:

<blockquote>
<p>GALAXIE 500 - LIVE IN LONDON</p>
<p>THANKS ANDY!</p>
</blockquote>

Scrawled below in another hand was written _"Same as Rough Trade tape"_. There was also an unfamiliar barcode stuck to the case.

I'm not sure how much material was gathered thanks to my call-out but Damon was kind enough to pop a credit on the back of the DVD booklet"

<blockquote>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>Sergio Huidor, Todd Ploharski and Nick Wickham for their help locating master tapes used in this compilation; and Andy Aldridge and the Galaxie 500 mailing list, who helped search for live video recordings of the band.</p>
</blockquote>

You can see the version that arrived on the DVD here:

There's also a VHS rip which is of lower quality but greater length - it includes two songs that didn't make it onto the DVD

I can't remember but suspect my copy is similar to the second one.
