Stutter Steps is the project of Ben Harrison and this is the first, self-titled album from the band and is fine collection of retro, guitar driven, indie rock music with some nice boy/girl vocals. The album was released in 2014 and Dean Wareham puts in an appearance on the opening track playing "_slide guitar_".

Ben's other connection with this site is that, as a programmer/curator at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, he was the person who decided to approach Dean & Britta for the [13 Most Beautiful](/2024/05/02/my-record-collection-132-13-most-beautiful-dvd/) project back in 2008.

<blockquote>
 We have to thank Ben Harrison, a curator at the Andy Warhol Museum, for making this happen. I knew very little about the Screen Tests until he called and described the project. I had been to the museum a few different times, but these are not the best known of Warhol’s films.

Stutter Steps was mastered by Ron Harrity of Nord Express/An Anderson - a long-time friend of AHFoW who contributed tracks to both the [Decomposing compilation](https://static.fullofwishes.co.uk/galaxie_list_tribute/) back in 2004, and the [On Fire 30 tribute album](/2024/07/22/my-record-collection-155-on-fire-30/) in 2019.

The album was sitting in my Amazon _wish list_ for a couple of years and then dropped to £4.78... so I pounced. 

Stutter Steps released a second album in 2020 which doesn't seem to have any direct AHFoW connection&dagger; so won't be making an appearance in this series, but [is on Bandcamp](https://stuttersteps.bandcamp.com/album/reeling) and worth a listen.

 - *Catalogue Number:* AHFOW 10/136
 - *Artist:* Stutter Steps
 - *Title:* Stutter Steps
 - *Packaging:* Digipack
 - *Format:* CD
 - Bought from Amazon for £4.78

_&dagger; ... but all the other Stutter Steps releases have indirect connections... the second album, and a single have sometime Dean & Britta collaborator Anthony LaMarca, and a 2017 EP has Jason Quever of Papercuts (and producer of Dean's Emancipated Hearts album) on one track.
