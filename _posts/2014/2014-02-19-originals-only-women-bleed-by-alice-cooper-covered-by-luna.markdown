<p>Luna's cover first turned up on the Lovedust promo CD released by Beggars Banquet in 2002, and then later on the 2xCD Beggars Banquet version of Best of Luna. You can now get it from Luna's Bandcamp as one of the bonus tracks on the <a href="http://luna.bandcamp.com/album/close-cover-before-striking">re-issue of Close Cover Before Striking</a>.<br />
