<p><a href="http://www.indietracks.co.uk/schedule/">Indietracks Festival has just announced the full schedule</a> for this year's festival. Dean Wareham will be headlining the indoor stage on the Saturday evening.</p>
<p>A few other things a quick skim has noticed...<br />
Joanna Gruesome will be on the indoor stage right before Dean which gives the exciting prospect of two Tugboats in 90 minutes!</p>
<p>Watoo Watoo are playing in the church on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>The whole festival will be amazing, but Saturday looks absolutely exhausting!</p>
<p>Here's Dean the last time he played a UK festival, Truck in 2011.</p>
