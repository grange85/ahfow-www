The latest band to join the [Tugboat covers club](/articles/2010-a-fleet-of-tugboats/) are Leeds based pop band Finnmark! Who have just released their [splendidly jaunty version of the Galaxie 500 standard](http://cathndadrecords.bandcamp.com/album/tugboat) on Cath 'n' Dad Records on Bandcamp.

The track is available on a pay what you want basis with all proceeds going to the charity [Remap](http://www.remap.org.uk/)
