<blockquote><p>Inspired by the idea that Hope and Dreaming are potential evils and destructive forces, this film uses cut outs and print motifs from [Gary Graham's] <a href="http://www.garygrahamnyc.com/collections/collection-fall-2014">Fall 2014 collection</a> as characters to illustrate Molly Drake's song "Dream Your Dreams." </p></blockquote>
<p>Molly Drake was singer-songwriter Nick Drake's mother and Dream Your Dreams is from a collection of recordings made at the Drake family home in the 1950s and <a href="http://mollydrake.bandcamp.com/">recently released by Squirrel Thing Recordings</a>.</p>
