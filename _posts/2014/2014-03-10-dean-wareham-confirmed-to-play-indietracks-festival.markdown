Dean Wareham was in the list when <a href="http://www.indietracks.co.uk/">Indietracks</a> announced <a href="http://www.indietracks.co.uk/line-up/">the first few bands for their 2014 festival</a> this evening. Discounted early bird tickets on sale until the 11th on May.</p>
<p>For those unaware Indietracks is a small and lovely indiepop festival, here's how they  describe it...</p>
<blockquote><p>Indietracks is a unique summer music festival which combines steam trains and indiepop music. It takes place at the Midland Railway Centre in the heart of the Derbyshire countryside. Visitors are free to enjoy steam train rides, railway attractions and museums, discos, art and craft workshops, great food and a selection of real ales.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last year's festival was a treat - <a href="http://www.ipernity.com/doc/grange85/album/471615">here are a stack of my photos</a>.</p>
<p>I'll certainly be there, have my tickets already, so see you all there.</p>
