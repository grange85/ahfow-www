Rain was one of the Lennon <em>Lennon/McCartney </em>compositions and was released as the b-side of Paperback Writer in the 1966. </p>
<p>As a b-side the band rather surprisingly made three promotional films for it, this one was made round the corner from me in Chiswick House</p>

<p>You can download this with Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste which frankly makes it probably the best value our there!</p>
