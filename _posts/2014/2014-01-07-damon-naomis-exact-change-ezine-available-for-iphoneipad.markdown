<blockquote><p>Exact Change is a monthly multimedia e-zine edited by Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang. It includes literature, music, art, film and video. Selections are short, but vital — the Exact Change app uses the format of the iPad and iPhone to reimagine footnotes, prefaces, wall texts, flap copy, annotations, dedications, inner sleeves, errata slips, slipcases, obi’s, handbills, broadsides, clippings, marginalia, postcards, invitations, shopping lists, ticket stubs, pressed flowers, love letters, and anything else you might find stashed inside a book, gatefold LP, or video box.</p></blockquote>
