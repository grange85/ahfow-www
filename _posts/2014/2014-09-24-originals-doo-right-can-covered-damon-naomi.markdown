Yoo Doo Right was 20 minutes long when released on CAN's Monster Movie LP in 1969, probably because 20 minutes was long enough for one side of a record. The song however had been edited down from a 6 hour live improvised concert held at Schloss Nörvenich, CAN's castle in North Rhine-Westphalia.<br />

<p>Damon & Naomi's live cover was recorded at TT The Bears in Cambridge, MA in April 1998 with Masaki Batoh and Michio Kurihara - this clocks in at a mere 6 minutes but is still pretty damned fantastic. It was released as a seven inch single of Grimsey Records with the cover of <a href="/2013/10/30/originals-its-all-over-now-baby-blue-by-bob-dylan-covered-by-damon-naomi/" title="Originals: It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue by Bob Dylan (covered by Damon & Naomi)">Dylan's It's All Over Now, Baby Blue</a> on the flip.</p>
