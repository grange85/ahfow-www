<p>OK, I know that Sally Free & Easy wasn't originally by Trees. It was written in the 1950s by English folk singer and songwriter Cyril Tawney, but I can't help but think that the Magic Hour version was more likely a cover of the track as recorded by the English folk band Trees for their brilliant 1970 album "On the Shore".</p>

<p>Here's a version by the Mr Tawney from his 1972 album "In Port".</p>

<p>Oh but all the greats of English folk probably have it in their repertoire.</p>
<p>Magic Hour released their cover on the 1994 album No Excess is Absurd and it was the only track by the band to feature Naomi Yang's vocals.<br />

<p>If you pop 10 minutes into this video you can see Magic Hour performing the track at The Sausage Machine in London in 1994.</p>
