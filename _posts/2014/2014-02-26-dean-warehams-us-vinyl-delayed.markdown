<p>Due to some problems with the test-pressings of the US vinyl of Dean Wareham's forthcoming solo album the vinyl will be delayed by a couple of weeks. CDs will go out as scheduled on release date, and folk who've pre-ordered the vinyl will get the download on release date (11 March). Dean posted on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DeanWareham">his Facebook page</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Vinyl LP is going to be delayed two weeks while new lacquers are made [...] No problem with the CD version, and UK vinyl release will be on time. Apologies but we want the vinyl to be perfect.</p></blockquote>
