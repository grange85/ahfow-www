You see I didn't think this through fully. Back when I started this series and was posting tracks by <a href="/2013/03/originals-blue-moon-by-big-star-covered-by-damon-naomi/" title="Originals: Blue Moon by Big Star (covered by Damon & Naomi)">Big Star</a>, <a href="/2013/02/originals-araca-azul-by-caetano-veloso-covered-by-damon-naomi/" title="Originals: Araçá azul by Caetano Veloso (covered by Damon & Naomi)">Caetono Veloso</a>, <a href="/2013/02/originals-back-in-your-life-by-jonathan-richman-covered-by-galaxie-500/" title="Originals: Back in Your Life by Jonathan Richman (covered by Galaxie 500)">Joanthan Richman</a> and <a href="/2013/03/originals-by-the-way-i-still-love-you-by-nancy-sinatra-covered-by-cagney-and-lacee/" title="Originals: By The Way (I Still Love You) by Nancy Sinatra (covered by Cagney and Lacee)">Nancy Sinatra</a>, it didn't cross my mind that the day would eventually arrive when I'd have to post a Guns N' Roses video to AHFoW. Well, today that day has arrived.</p>
<p>Sweet Child o' Mine was recorded for Guns N' Roses 1987 debut album Appetite for Destruction and was their only US number 1 single<br />

<p>Luna recorded the song as a b-side during the sessions for their fifth album <a href="/database/release/the-days-of-our-nights/" title="The Days Of Our Nights">The Days of Our Nights</a> but US label at the time insisted they put it on the album. And then dropped the band before releasing it:</p>

<p>Here's a radio session version from some time in 1999 (I have it listed as January 2000 but Justin is on the recording and had left the band by then so I guess the date is a broadcast date, not the recording date).<br />
