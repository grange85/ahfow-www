While <a href="/2014/05/08/a-head-full-of-wishes-shows-database-updated/" title="A Head Full of Wishes shows database updated">working on this web site</a> I found myself, as I often do, listening to Galaxie 500. And, as it often does, it ended up with me listening to as many different versions of <a href="/database/track/dont-let-our-youth-go-to-waste/" title="Don’t Let Our Youth Go To Waste">Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste</a> as I can find. You can hear all <a href="/2013/05/15/originals-dont-let-our-youth-go-to-waste-by-jonathan-richman-covered-by-galaxie-500/" title="Originals: Don’t Let Our Youth Go to Waste by Jonathan Richman (covered by Galaxie 500)">four officially released versions on the "Originals" post over here</a>.</p>
<p>But here's another gem, and one I was in the room for, a live version from <a href="/database/show/1989-12-13-galaxie-500-subterania-london-uk/">Galaxie 500's show at The Subterania in late 1989</a>.</p>
