<p>Tim Buckley released Song to the Siren on his 1970 album Starsailor, before that however it had been performed by Tim on the last episode of The Monkees in 1968:<br />

<p>Also before Tim's release it had appeared on Pat Boone's 1969 LP Departure, apparently we're not supposed to like <a href="http://youtu.be/3gH3Z6BOCco">Pat's version</a> but it's not so bad (if you ignore the odd couple of seconds at the beginning), I rather like the brass led arrangement, and like it more as it gets bigger, probably because by then Pat's croon is getting a wee bit tiresome... it's not as good as the version from The Monkees (above), but (and here comes controversy), it's better than the hammed-up version on Starsailor</p>

<p>Damon & Naomi released a beautiful version of the song on their fake "Live in San Sebastian" album in 2002.<br />
