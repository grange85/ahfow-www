<blockquote><p>... as a whole the track exudes a browbeating self importance that quickly becomes tiresome [...]. While My Guitar Gently Weeps enshrines, in its plodding sequence, rocks typical overstatement and slow rate of harmonic change. The energetic topicality of pop is here supplanted by a dull grandiosity predictive of the simplified stadium music of the Seventies and Eighties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Damon & Naomi's version was released on their fifth album The Earth is Blue in 2005 and includes the slightly different lyrics from the Anthology version .<br />
