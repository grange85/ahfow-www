George Harrison's While My Guitar Gently Weeps was originally released by The Beatles on The Beatles (aka The White Album) in 1968<br />

<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/while-my-guitar-gently-weeps-19691231">Rolling Stone reckoned it was the 10th greatest Beatles song</a> Ian MacDonald in the brilliant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1556527330/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1556527330&linkCode=as2&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkId=NN7RIHTRYD52A54J">Revolution in the Head</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=aheadfullofwi-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1556527330" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, wasn't particularly taken with the track (but then he wasn't often impressed with George's songs):</p>
<blockquote><p>... as a whole the track exudes a browbeating self importance that quickly becomes tiresome [...]. While My Guitar Gently Weeps enshrines, in its plodding sequence, rocks typical overstatement and slow rate of harmonic change. The energetic topicality of pop is here supplanted by a dull grandiosity predictive of the simplified stadium music of the Seventies and Eighties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Damon & Naomi's version was released on their fifth album <a href="/database/release/the-earth-is-blue-release/" title="The Earth is Blue">The Earth is Blue</a> in 2005 and includes the slightly different lyrics from the Anthology version .<br />
