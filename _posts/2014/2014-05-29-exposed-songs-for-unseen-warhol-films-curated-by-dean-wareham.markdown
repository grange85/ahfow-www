> Created in celebration of The Andy Warhol Museum’s 20th anniversary, this multimedia performance event comprises 15 never-before-seen films captured by Andy Warhol between 1963 and 1968 on his original 16mm Bolex camera. Five songwriter-composers, reflecting the generational trajectory, musical lineage, and influence of New York-based artists from the post-Velvet Underground 70s through the present day perform original 22 scores to these rare Warhol selections—a combination of portraits and actualités featuring such superstars and luminaries as John Giorno, Marcel Duchamp, Mario Montez, Jim Rosenquist, Billy Kluver, Marisol, Taylor Mead, Mary Woronov, Edie Sedgwick, and Andy Warhol.
