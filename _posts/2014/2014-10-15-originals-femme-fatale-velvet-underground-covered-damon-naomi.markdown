Another one that slipped through the net (and another one that I missed in the Fs - I was obviously a bit careless back then).</p>
<p>Femme Fatale was written by Lou Reed when Andy Warhol asked him to write a song about Edie Sedgewick. The song was sung by Nico and was on their 1967 LP The Velvet Underground & Nico LP (and on the b-side of a Sunday Morning 7").<br />

<p>Here's Nico with Cale and Reed performing it in 1972<br />

<p>Damon & Naomi recorded the track with Ghost (at Ghosts suggestion) in the sessions for their album Damon & Naomi with Ghost however the track never got released until the 2012 reissue of the album when it appeared on a bonus 7" single with some copies (the other side of the 7" also got missed in this series - that's coming next week!).</p>
<p>You can still <a href="http://damonandnaomi.com/shop/dn-with-ghost-lp/">buy copies of the LP with the 7" single from Damon & Naomi's shop</a>.</p>
<p>I actually don't have this track digitally so you'll have to imagine how great it is... and it is at least that!</p>
