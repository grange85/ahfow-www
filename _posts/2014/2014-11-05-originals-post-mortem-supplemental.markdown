<p>I started the originals series on 31 January 2013 so it took me one year and eight months to get through them all... here's a few stats<br />
<a href="/list-originals/#galaxie_500">Covered by Galaxie 500</a> : 12<br />
<a href="/list-originals/#luna">Covered by Luna</a> : 21<br />
<a href="/list-originals/#damon_and_naomi">Covered by Damon & Naomi</a>[<a href="#footnote-1">1</a>] : 24<br />
<a href="/list-originals/#dean_and_britta">Covered by Dean & Britta</a> : 17<br />
<a href="/list-originals/#dean_wareham">Covered by Dean Wareham</a>[<a href="#footnote-2">2</a>] : 15</p>
<p>Most covered songwriters<br />
Jonathan Richman : 4<br />
Lou Reed : 4 (solo and with the VU - plus a bonus coming down this very page)<br />
John Lennon : 3 (2 solo tracks and one of The Beatles' covers)[<a href="#footnote-3">3</a>]<br />
Lee Hazelwood : 3</p>
<p><a href="/category/originals/" title="List: Originals">See all posts in the Originals series over here</a>.</p>
<p>I generally stuck to tracks that had received an official release, although a few stray ineligible ones slipped through. Here are a couple that didn't but could have:</p>

{% ahfowaudio "http://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/audio/luna-19951026-walk-on-the-wild-side.mp3" "Luna - Walk on The Wild Side" %}


{% ahfowaudio "http://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/03-damon_and_naomi/audio/damon-and-naomi-20110511-shine-a-light.mp3" "Damon &amp; Naomi - Shine a Light" %}

<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p id="footnote-1">1: Including Magic Hour</p>
<p id="footnote-2">2: Including Cagney and Lacee. Not including the covers on <a href="/database/release/emancipated-hearts-release/" title="Emancipated Hearts">Emancipated Hearts</a> or <a href="/database/release/dean-wareham-release/" title="Dean Wareham">Dean Wareham</a> as both were released after I started the series.</p>
<p id="footnote-3">3: Technically John Lennon also gets a credit on <a href="/2013/04/originals-cheese-and-onions-by-the-rutles-covered-by-galaxie-500/" title="Originals: Cheese and Onions by The Rutles (covered by Galaxie 500)">Cheese and Onions</a></p>
