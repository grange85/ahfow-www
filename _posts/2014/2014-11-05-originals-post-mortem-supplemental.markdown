<p>I started the originals series on 31 January 2013 so it took me one year and eight months to get through them all... here's a few stats<br />
 - Covered by Galaxie 500 : 12
Covered by Luna</a> : 21
Covered by Damon & Naomi[<a href="#footnote-1">1</a>] : 24
Covered by Dean & Britta : 17
Covered by Dean Wareham[<a href="#footnote-2">2</a>] : 15
<p>Most covered songwriters<br />
Jonathan Richman : 4<br />
Lou Reed : 4 (solo and with the VU - plus a bonus coming down this very page)<br />
John Lennon : 3 (2 solo tracks and one of The Beatles' covers)[<a href="#footnote-3">3</a>]<br />
Lee Hazelwood : 3</p>

<p>I generally stuck to tracks that had received an official release, although a few stray ineligible ones slipped through. Here are a couple that didn't but could have:</p>

<p id="footnote-3">3: Technically John Lennon also gets a credit on <a href="/2013/04/10/originals-cheese-and-onions-by-the-rutles-covered-by-galaxie-500/" title="Originals: Cheese and Onions by The Rutles (covered by Galaxie 500)">Cheese and Onions</a></p>
