<p>OK, quick bonus entry... just in case you thought I might not have covered this song in enough detail already!</p>
<p>In last week's <a href="/2014/06/originals-changing-world-claudine-longet/" title="Originals: This Changing World by Claudine Longet (covered by Damon & Naomi)">Originals post I pointed out that the original of This Changing World</a> was actually the b-side of the 1968 Monaco entry in the Eurovision Song Contest, and was therefore too obscure for the internet to provide a version to listen to...</p>
<p>Well, not any more. Where Spotify and YouTube failed, eBay came up trumps, so here is the original of This Changing World, a song that even Damon & Naomi didn't realise they had covered!</p>
