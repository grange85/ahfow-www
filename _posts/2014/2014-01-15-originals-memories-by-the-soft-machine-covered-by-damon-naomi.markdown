<p>Memories was a very early Soft Machine track from 1967, written by Hugh Hopper and recorded as a demo by Hopper, Robert Wyatt and Kevin Ayers by Yardbirds' producer Giorgio Gomelsky - that snippet of my knowledge was lifted from a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131013220921/http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/albumofthemonth/early-soft-machine">cool article about early Soft Machine by Julian Cope</a>.<br />

<p>Damon & Naomi covered the track for their first album More Sad Hits<br />

<p>Here's Damon & Naomi playing the track in a bookshop in 2008<br />

<p>Damon & Naomi's version includes the line "<em>pet</em> shops where people knew us", later it was pointed out to them that the lyric was actually "<em>past</em> shops where people knew us" although to my ears it still sounds like "pet" in the Soft Machine version.</p>
