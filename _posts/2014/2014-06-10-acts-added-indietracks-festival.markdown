The very lovely Indietracks folk have <a href="http://www.indietracks.co.uk/the-chills-and-the-proper-ornaments-join-indietracks-2014/">just announced a bunch more acts</a> for this year's festival at the end of July. Top New Zealand pop act The Chills will be playing on Friday night and lovely French popsters Watoo Watoo have also been added to the bill.</p>
<p>Here's Watoo Watoo's lovely version of Luna's Chinatown which first saw the light of day on the AHFoW fan compilation Decomposing, before getting a proper release on the lovely La Fuite album in 2007.</p>

<p>Dean Wareham will be playing the festival on the Saturday evening.</p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="http://www.indietracks.co.uk/">Indietracks website for the full list of bands and to get tickets</a>... because you wouldn't want to miss such a lovely festival now would you?</p>
<p>And here's The Chills playing one of the greatest ever pop tunes in 1988... with a familiar face on bass!<br />
