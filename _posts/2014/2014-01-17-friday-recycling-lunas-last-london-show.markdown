<blockquote><p>Being too cool to change colours may have kept Luna a secret, but all credit to them for sticking to their guns. If they ever "come back for an Indian summer", as the song has it, they'll be welcome.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>With the knowledge that this is the last song Wareham will ever sing at a London gig – with Luna, at least – the combination of lyrics like “we’ll come back for Indian Summer / and go our separate ways....buckle up, we’re wayward bound” and the song’s childlike melody make the occasion seem incredibly poignant</p></blockquote>
