<p>With the recent releases of Dean Wareham's <em>Emancipated Hearts</em> and the more recent <em>Dean Wareham</em> you'd be forgiven for thinking that this was the first ever solo releases by Dean... this is a little thrown together post to prove otherwise:</p>
<p>Here's what I believe was Dean's debut solo outing on the Shimmy Disc compilation <a href="/database/release/what-else-do-you-do-a-compilation-of-quiet-music/">What Else Do You Do?</a> released in 1990. It's an early, acoustic version of <em>Smile</em> which got it's full band release on Luna's debut LP Lunapark a couple of years later.</p>

<p>In 1991 Dean released a solo electric guitar piece called <em>West Broadway</em> on the No6/Glitterhouse compilation <a href="/database/release/guitarrorists/">Guitarrorists</a></p>

<p>Also in 1991 Dean released a version of Beat Happening's <em>Indian Summer</em> (later to become a regular in Luna's set) on a <a href="/database/release/chemical-imbalance-5/">promo 7" single given away with Chemical Imbalance</a> magazine.</p>

<p>After Galaxie 500 split Dean was given some money to record some demos, these made an appearance on the <a href="/database/release/anesthesia-release/">Mint Records Anesthesia single</a> as a solo release.</p>

<p>In 2005 Dean recorded a solo version of Pink Floyd's <em>Hey You</em> for the soundtrack of the Noah Baumbach film <a href="/database/release/the-squid-and-the-whale/">The Squid and The Whale</a></p>

<p>... and then in 2014 <em>Love is Colder than Death</em> was released, the track was on Emancipated Hearts which Pitchfork described as <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18636-dean-wareham-emancipated-hearts-ep/">"astonishingly, his debut solo release"</a></p>
<p>So Pitchfork, this post is to prove you wrong.</p>
