<blockquote><p>You know what you're going to get from Dean & Britta (Phillips) and it's always good and Velvety. He put his psych guitar tone on surfy rocker "Paraphernalia" (Susan Bottomly dancing with a whip) and "Where Did Everyone Go?" to accompany Nico eating a banana (seductively, of course) with Antoine in front of the iconic Warhol/VU banana logo. The couple went a few shades darker for the black-and-white "Kiss the Boot," which had poet/filmmaker Gerard Malanga lying submissively at the feet of Warhol superstar Mary Woronov.</p></blockquote>
<p>The show, which also features Martin Rev (Suicide) and Tom Verlaine plays at <a href="http://cap.ucla.edu/calendar/details/warholexposed">Royce Hall, Center for the Art of Performance at UCLA, Los Angeles</a> on Friday (24 October) and then <a href="http://www.bam.org/music/2014/exposed-songs-for-unseen-warhol-films">BAM in NYC from the 6th to the 8th of November</a>.</p>
