<p>And following on from the <a href="/2014/01/04/originals-living-too-close-to-the-ground-by-the-everly-brothers-covered-by-dean-wareham/" title="Originals: Living Too Close to The Ground by The Everly Brothers (covered by Dean Wareham)">previous post</a>... I also wasn't going to include tracks that had not had an official release (although I have already bent this rule at least once) so this lovely cover of I Wonder If I Care as Much by Damon & Naomi wouldn't have been included either - but once again Phil Everly's passing has forced my hand.</p>

<p>I Wonder If I Care as Much was, like <a href="/2014/01/04/originals-living-too-close-to-the-ground-by-the-everly-brothers-covered-by-dean-wareham/" title="Originals: Living Too Close to The Ground by The Everly Brothers (covered by Dean Wareham)">Living Too Close to the Ground</a>, also appeared on the boys 1968 album Roots, although had originally been recorded in 1957 as the b-side of Bye Bye Love.<br />

<p>Damon & Naomi covered it in 2007 for a La blogoth√®que video session and it is certainly a cover of the 1968 version.<br />
