While the US got a single disc Best of Luna and Lunafied as a download, the bands UK label, Beggars Banquet gave us on this side of the pond a lovely two disc edition with a whole disc of _Lunafied_ cover versions.

The discs were named "Best of Luna" and "Lunafied" although this led to the awkwardness of having a "Best of Luna" disc without any cover versions - this could almost be fixed by the fact that the whole package was called "Best of Luna" but then... should a "Best of Luna" package have "Only Women Bleed" or "In The FLesh"?

When I covered the US "Best of Luna" I created a table stating the album origins of each of the tracks... so, lets revisit and compare:



| Best of Luna           | US | UK

| Bewitched              |4   |4

| Pup Tent               |2   |2
| The Days of Our Nights |1   |2
| Romantica              |0   |2
