By the Winter 2001/2 issue of Ptolemaic Terrascope the magazine had reached the point where it had a CD covermount rather than the 7" EPs of previous years and this CD came with issue 31 of Ptolemaic Terrascope and includes a {% ahfowtrack "Eye of the Storm" %} with Michio Kurihara.

Eye of the Storm is on the CD to represent Michio Kurihara who has a lengthy interview in the magazine that exposes just how many musical pies he has his finger in. The interview was conducted shortly after the Damon & Naomi tour of Europe that was documented in the Song to the Siren DVD:

<blockquote>
<p>For me personally, that was the most satisfying tour I've been on in years. We toured the States together last our autumn, but this time communication through sound was so much deeper. Their live sound is extremely delicate and it already feels very complete in itself. I was worried about adding anything to it that would damage their original sound, so the first few times we played together were very much trial and error. It took a bit of time before I could accommodate my sound to theirs. But during the tour I was gradually able to grasp their unique sense of timing and breathing. Particularly from around the middle of the tour on there were a number of amazing moments when we got this real synergy between the vibrations of the audience and the vibrations that we on stage were putting out. I guess that's what people mean when they talk about "magic". These kinds of experiences are irreplaceable. On the best things about long tours like that one is that you can feel the quality of the band's sound getting better and better with each performance. I liked Damon & Naomi's music before, but on this tour I was reminded of just what is great about them. I don't think that they're technical players, but they've transcended that and they have a deep sense of song. That's what this tour showed me again.</p>

<p>We were fortunate in the choice of support acts on the tour they were local groups, but all were individual and amazing. In London we had Clientele; Richard Youngs in Glasgow, Paloma in Paris, all were striking. This was the first tour I'd been on where we had to haul our amps and other equipment around, jumping on and off trains all over Europe. It was a bit tiring at times, but still a good experience. I was especially struck by the scenery we saw from the train window: pastoral in the UK, and the desolate mountains in Spain.</p>

The version of Eye of the Storm is the one that was later released on the [Live in a Living Room in Cambridge, MA](/2026/02/12/my-record-collection-damon-naomi-1001-nights/) album, and interestingly it is a clean version without the applause added to it which I guess makes it a bit of a [lost track](/category/lost-tracks/).

The insert with the CD completely _forgets_ to mention anything about Eye of the Storm, I wonder if that's because of it's imminent use in the fake live album. If you're unaware of _the deception_ you can read about it in the post on [1001 Nights](/2026/02/12/my-record-collection-damon-naomi-1001-nights/) from a couple of months back.
