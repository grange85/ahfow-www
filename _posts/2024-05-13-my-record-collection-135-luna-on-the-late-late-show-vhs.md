After no (national) TV ever, suddenly in the wake of the _problematic_ "The Days of Our Nights" Luna started getting surprising TV exposure. This is a VHS of their performance on Craig Kilborn's Late Late Show broadcast in the early hours of the 9th June 2000.

<blockquote>
<p>
Watching Luna right now (just happened to be up.)
The guitars sound great.  Dean's vocals are pretty
awful.  Nowhere near as good as in concert.
</p><p>
They're doing Four Thousand Days.  It sounds kind
of poppy and jangly.  Almost like a single.  Maybe?
</p><p>
They're actually givng a few shots to Britta.
I noticed in the Cynthia Garret show, they almost
never showed her on close up.
</p><p>
Doh!  It's over, just one song, no follow up, no meet
the band, no plug the album.  Oh well.
