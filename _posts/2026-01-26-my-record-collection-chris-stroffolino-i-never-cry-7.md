I first came across Chris Stroffolino&dagger; on the 30th August 2013 when his Twitter account tweeted that he was "recording an #AliceCooper song with #DeanWareham and #BrittaPhillips of #Luna, etc." - on 6th September 2012 a video turned up on YouTube of him, with Dean & Britta, playing Luna's Lost in Space in the back of a van.

Shortly after I posted about the video it was pulled off YouTube. A couple of days later Dean emailed me explaining that the video was removed for some audio improvements and would be replaced and he also linked me to an analysis of Lost in Space by Mr. Stroffolino that then takes the "you need/time off/for good/behaviour" lyric into a courtroom:

<blockquote>
<p><b>Prosecutor:</b> [His] laziness is evident in his perpetual yearning for “something else” he can’t even name. Even his fantasy heroes who he once looked to as exemplary role models seem tame to him. He would rather be “crazy” than “tame” and thus cannot contribute to society in a functioning, or even productive, way. This case is “lost in space,” and will not listen to the advice of those who are trying to help him. His actions present no evidence of any rehabilitation, and clearly his sentence should not be shortened.</p>
<p><b>Judge:</b> We will now hear from the advocate:</p>
<p><b>Advocate:</b> The Prosecutor neglects to take into account all the evidence. The defendant is clearly overworked. He certainly acts tame: he’s tired, and needs time off, in order to continue to perform his exceptional, and exemplary—and even magical—duties that he has performed in the penitentiary.</p>
</blockquote>

The aforementioned "#AliceCooper song" finally arrived on the b-side of a 7" single released on Spanish label Munster in March of the following year and is a cover of I Never Cry from the 1976 album [Alice Cooper Goes to Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Cooper_Goes_to_Hell). I couldn't find the track online anywhere so have ripped it from my single and popped it on YouTube (so apologies for any pops/crackles you might hear).

The a-side of the single is [I'm Not Going Astray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_1kcGeEsoM) which also turned up on a whole album of "Piano Van" recordings called [Griffith Park](https://pianovan.bandcamp.com/album/griffith-park). The album was produced by Jeff Feuerzeig (who's [previously had a mention in this series](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/08/05/my-record-collection-159-lys-guillorn-cd/), and has thirteen songs delivered as if played in the corner of a pub late on a Friday evening.

The album's Bandcamp page describes Chris thus:

<blockquote>
Chris Stroffolino is a former Silver Jews member, a Ph.D. holding Shakespearean scholar and published author of eight books of poetry who currently lives in his van with an rescued, upright piano bolted to the chassis.

Since the album was released Chris appears to have gone fairly quiet.
