Luna have just released a digital single featuring covers of Lou Reed's Satellite of Love and David Bowie's Starman. The single is available on [Luna's bandcamp](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/satellite-of-love)

Luna have been covering 'Satellite of Love' live recently. Starman got its first airing before Luna's live streamed show way back in May 2021 so we've been knowingly waiting for this one for two and a half years! No sign of the video yet.

The single can be bought for $2 (or more) [over at Bandcamp](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/satellite-of-love)
