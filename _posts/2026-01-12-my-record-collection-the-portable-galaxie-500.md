Oddly there are two CDs that I swear I had in my collection but can't actually find one was the original Uncollected released by Ryko from 2004, and this CD compilation The Portable Galaxie 500 - when I realised this I bought a copy in 2024 from Damon & Naomi along with some other stuff. I still don't have a copy of Uncollected but hope to have one before this series ends!

If someone asked me to pick twelve Galaxie 500 tracks for a comp it could easily have been the twelve on this one. Actually [someone did ask me once to pick ten](https://poeticjusticemagazine.com/2022/10/04/a-head-full-of-wishes-top-10-galaxie-500-songs/) and six tracks from The Portable were in my list - plus the studio version of Summertime ... so pretty much 7/10 which means this is a fairly close. Although I was asked to pick my "Top 10" which is very different from picking for a compilation.

I think what's possibly more interesting than what's on it is what's not on it - most notably Strange which, in recent years has become the band's most popular song on streamed platforms but around the time of this compilation's release, and even in the early days of streaming, it probably wasn't in the band's top five tracks. Damon commented on this in a blog post in 2018:

<blockquote>
<p>“Strange,” a track off our album On Fire, is streaming far more than any of our other songs - roughly ten times as often as the songs that surround it in its original sequence on the album (”Snowstorm” and “When Will You Come Home”).</p> 

<p>What’s especially surprising about this is that “Strange” was not a single for Galaxie 500, and hasn’t historically been among our most popular tracks.

Dean disagrees...

<blockquote>
I mention that the most popular Galaxie 500 song on Spotify is “Strange” and there has been some speculation from my former bandmate Damon that this success was driven by the Spotify algorithm: “Strange” was not a single back in the day and no video was made, so why would it get to the top of the our chart now?  I would counter that it should have been a single, and its popularity today is the proof. The song found its audience.

I'm inclined to agree with Damon however, possibly because Strange isn't one of my favourite Galaxie 500 tracks and it doesn't make a jot of sense to me that it would get streamed "roughly ten times as often" as Snowstorm or When Will You Come Home which are to my mind the most _Galaxie 500_ of all songs! I'm inclined to think that Spotify _listeners_ listen to only Strange but _Galaxie 500 fans_ are just as likely to listen to something else!
