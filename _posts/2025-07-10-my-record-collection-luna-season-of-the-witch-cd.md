This is my CD copy of Luna's cover of Donovan's Season of the Witch and is the first copy I bought around the time of release.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/luna-season-of-the-witch-cd.jpg" "Luna - Season of the Witch (CD)" %}

As with the [10" vinyl copy](/2024/10/17/my-record-collection-180-luna-season-of-the-witch-10/) the CD has the three tracks Luna played on The Mark Radcliffe Show in December 1995, you can [listen to the whole session on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO3Dmtofo4).

The video for Season of the Witch was directed by Mary Harron who directed the film it comes from, and I've [already posted about that](/2023/11/30/my-record-collection-091-i-shot-andy-warhol/) too!

So maybe I could post about the Donovan original... [but I already did that too](/2014/04/16/originals-season-of-the-witch-by-donovan-covered-by-luna/) - although there's nothing particularly insightful there so probably not worth following that link!

Everyone covers Season of the Witch, so, here are my favourite three covers that aren't by Luna

1. Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and Trinity - recorded it in 1967 - this TV performance is great... although Julie's look is a major contribution to that!

2. Sam Gopal recorded it for their 1968 album Escalator... and yes, that's Lemmy singing (so I get another Mot√∂rhead reference in here).

3. Actually only just came across this Meursault cover but it is pretty darned good:
