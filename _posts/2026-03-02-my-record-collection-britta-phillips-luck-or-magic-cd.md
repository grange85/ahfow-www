This is the CD copy of Britta's lovely debut album that was part of the "super bundle" on Pledgemusic that included the [(damaged) LP](/2023/03/27/my-record-collection-020-britta-phillips-luck-or-magic-lp/) a signed _accordion_ of postcards, and a T-shirt.

The disc came in a nice, simple digipack although it's missing the photo that was on the LP inner sleeve (that I preferred to the one used on the front). Britta has signed the actual disc in silver pen.

Britta played some live dates around the time of release including a US west coast tour with Teenage Fanclub. There are a few videos on YouTube but almost everyone decided to video Drive which, I'm sorry, is still my least favourite song on the album... not because it's not good but because of what it is. Even Britta seems a little embarrassed by it? Dean & Britta  played it at Krankenhaus and she almost apologised for it...

Dean: We didn't write that song  
Britta: No... but it's different the way we do it

Here's a clip of Britta (with Dean) playing Million Dollar Doll while supporting Teenage Fanclub in LA in 2017
