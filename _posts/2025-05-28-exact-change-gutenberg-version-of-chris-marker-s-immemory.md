Damon and Naomi's other role as independent publishers sees them publishing _'Immemory : Gutenberg Version' by Chris Marker_ on Exact Change next month and will be making a couple of appearances promoting it.

In 1997 Chris Marker released Immemory as a CD-ROM which over time became un-playable, it was then released as a Flash version on the Internet which also suffered from technical obsolescence so Exact Change has decided to publish it in a format that has already stood the test to time.

<blockquote>
n Immemory, Chris Marker originally used the format of a CD-ROM to create a multi-layered, multimedia memoir. The reader investigates “zones” of travel, war, cinema, and poetry, navigating through image and text as if physically exploring Marker’s memory itself. The result is a veritable 21st-century Remembrance of Things Past, an exploration of the state of memory in our era. With it, Marker both invented a literary form and perfected it. And yet the digital format he chose for his experiment was quickly rendered obsolete.

Damon and Naomi will be making a couple of appearances next week to promote the publication;

On the 3rd June at Light Industry in Brooklyn NY:
<blockquote>
To celebrate its release we’ll be hosting a reception at Light Industry, where we’ll be joined by Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang from Exact Change and the volume’s editor, Isabel Ochoa Gold. Guests can stop in to browse and buy the book in our lobby and, at their leisure, wander over to our theater space, where they’ll find a screen recording of a reader making their way through the multimedia memoir, as well as a fin-de-siècle Bondi Blue iMac on which it can be played directly.

On the 4th and 5th of June The Brattle Theater in Cambridge MA will have two days of screenings:
<blockquote>
 <p>
     For these special screenings, we start on Wednesday by pairing Marker’s landmark, still image and narration sci-fi short LA JETÉE with Alfred Hitchcock’s magnificent VERTIGO. Both films, like Immemory itself concern themselves with the labyrinthine subjectivity of human memory. In LA JETÉE, a man is sent both to the past and future as part of an attempt to save his present and realizes that his life has folded over on itself in a way that he never could have imagined. In VERTIGO, a down on his luck ex-cop becomes obsessed when a woman he is charged with following dies but he later meets her exact double.
 </p>

<p>
    On Thursday, we welcome Exact Change’s Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang and Isabel Ochoa Gold, the editor of “Immemory: Gutenberg Edition”, to give a brief presentation about the project and the original CD-ROM followed by a screening of Chris Marker’s SANS SOLEIL, a sprawling-and-yet-intimate travelogue. SANS SOLEIL is a masterful work of pseudo-documentary as Marker’s own ‘home movies’ are woven together by a fictional narration.
