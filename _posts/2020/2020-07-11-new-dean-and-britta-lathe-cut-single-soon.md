Dean Wareham gave a 50 second sneak preview of a new Dean & Britta lathe-cut single [on his Instagram](https://instagram.com/deanwareham) yesterday. The single will be live versions of The Bee Gees Massachusetts and The Incredbible String Band's Air, both recorded during one of their live stream concerts.

It's another clear, square, plastic disc - more details when I get them - watch this space.
