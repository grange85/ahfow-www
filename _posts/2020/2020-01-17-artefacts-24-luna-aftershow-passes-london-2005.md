Fifteen years ago tonight Luna played their _last_ London show and today's artefacts are mine and Hazel's aftershow passes. Mine's the better condition one as Hazel's lived stuck inside her jacket for months - not for any close-to-her-heart-fan stuff but because it just was.

It was a perfect farewell: met up with a bunch of other fans; hung out (briefly) in the aftershow squash court; got interviewed for Tell Me Do You Miss Me (that thankfully ended up on the cutting room floor); and the show ended with Indian Summer which I'd seen the band play when they [first came through London in 1992](/2017/02/27/download-luna-in-london-25-years-ago/).

Off course most farewells aren't farewells any more and [Luna were back in London just over ten years later](/database/luna/shows/2015/2015-07-31-luna-the-garage-london-uk/).

You can [download the full show, and see pictures](/database/luna/shows/2005/2005-01-17-luna-ulu-london-uk/) (including fat me ligging with the band), over here.

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
