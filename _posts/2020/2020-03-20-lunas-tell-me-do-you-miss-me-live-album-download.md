Last year Luna released a [fantastic limited-edition pseudo-bootleg LP](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/releases/luna-tell-me-do-you-miss-me-lp/) containing live recordings made on their farewell tour in 2004/5 - the record is now available as a [digital download via the band's Bandcamp page](https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/tell-me-do-you-miss-me).

If you buy it today (20th March 2020) Bandcamp are waiving their usual fees and Luna will get all the money from the sale.
