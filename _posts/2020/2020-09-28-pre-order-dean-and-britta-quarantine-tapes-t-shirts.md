Just put up for [pre-order in Dean Wareham's shop are some T-shirts](https://deanwareham.com/shop#tees) with Brian Calvin's lips design for "Quarantine Tapes".

The T-shirts are available in black or light blue and cost $25 (and postage).

You can also pre-order a "Quarantine Tapes" tote bag for $15 (and postage).

If you haven't already you should also buy the album which is available for $7 from Bandcamp and is well worth it!
