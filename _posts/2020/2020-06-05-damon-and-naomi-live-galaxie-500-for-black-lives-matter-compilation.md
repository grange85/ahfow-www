Damon & Naomi have given a beautiful [live version of Galaxie 500's Another Day](https://roughtradepublishing.bandcamp.com/track/damon-and-naomi-another-day-galaxie-500-cover) to this huge compilation released on bandcamp in aid of [Black Visions Collective](https://www.blackvisionsmn.org/).

The track was recorded in Salford on their 2019 UK tour.

The 97 track compilation has been released by Rough Trade Publishing/Bank Robber Music:

> Released exclusively on Bandcamp, this collection gathers unreleased tracks, live recordings, vintage cuts, demos, and previously released songs from some of the artists we work with. We put a call out for songs on May 30th and in less than a week this was the amazing response we got.

The album, [Talk - Action = Zero](https://roughtradepublishing.bandcamp.com/album/talk-action-zero-a-compilation-benefitting-black-lives-matter), is pay what you want and the cause is good so ... pay what you *can*!
