This Friday (midnight to midnight PST) excellent music download service [Bandcamp are waiving their revenue share](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser) so everything you spend goes to the artist. If you can, spend. It's going to be a rough few months for a lot of artists who rely on getting out to make their money ...

> To raise even more awareness around the pandemic’s impact on musicians everywhere, we’re waiving our revenue share on sales this Friday, March 20 (from midnight to midnight Pacific Time), and rallying the Bandcamp community to put much needed money directly into artists’ pockets.
> 
> For many artists, a single day of boosted sales can mean the difference between being able to pay rent or not. Still, we consider this just a starting point. Musicians will continue to feel the effects of lost touring income for many months to come, so we’re also sharing some ideas below on how fans can support the artists they love and how artists can give fans new, creative ways to provide support.

You can fill the gaps in your AHFoW related collection here:

* [Damon & Naomi](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser)
* [Dean & Britta](https://deanandbritta.bandcamp.com/)
* [Luna](https://luna.bandcamp.com/)
* [Magic Hour](https://magic-hour.bandcamp.com/)
* [Britta Phillips](https://brittaphillips.bandcamp.com/)
* [Galaxie 500](https://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/)

There is so much great music on Bandcamp from wonderful artists who aren't related and you can try before you buy - so head over and help out if you can.
