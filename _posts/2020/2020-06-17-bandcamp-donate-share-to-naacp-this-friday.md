This Friday (19th June) Bandcamp will be donating 100% of their revenue share to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund so Friday would be a good day to fill some of those gaps in your collection and see some of that money going to a good cause.

> The recent killings of George Floyd, Tony McDade, Sean Reed, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and the ongoing state-sanctioned violence against black people in the US and around the world are horrific tragedies. We stand with those rightfully demanding justice, equality, and change, and people of color everywhere who live with racism every single day, including many of our fellow employees and artists and fans in the Bandcamp community.
