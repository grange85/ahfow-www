Galaxie 500's live album Copenhagen will be getting its first ever vnyl release as part of Record Store Day 2020.

And then in the RSD lists appearing in various places, [most notably on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RecordStoreDay/comments/f2gjtn/the_list_so_far_for_rsd_2020_an_ongoing_project/) this little nugget crept in...

> Galaxie 500 - Copenhagen - 2LP/etching (202020 Records)

At just under an hour the show would be too long for one LP, so I suspect the _etching_ is filling up the space on the fourth side.

As soon as I hear more I'll post here.
