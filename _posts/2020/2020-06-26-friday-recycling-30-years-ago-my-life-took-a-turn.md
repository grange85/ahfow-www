_This is recycled from my [Everything's Swriling last year](https://www.grange85.co.uk/swirling/2019/06/27/29-years-ago-today-my-life-took-a-turn/) - but 30 years seems a bit more significant than 29 so I'm reposting here ... it's a bit personal but ... this is my blog_

So... at, I'd guess about 22:30 on 27th June 1990 this happened (38 minutes and 22 seconds in):

{% ahfowvideo "ozeRVpP4T0Q?start=2302" "Galaxie 500 - Subterania - 1990-06-27" "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/show_assets/1990-06-27/1990-06-27_galaxie_500-naomi-vidcap.jpg" %}

... this pretty much changed the course of my life ... as follows:

**1990**: I was working in the film stores at the BBC - not a great job but the pay wasn't too bad (with some overtime) and enabled me to get out and see gigs. I'd already been there six years (apart from a 18 months as a film projectionist) so it was looking like I was stuck there.

**22:30 1990-06-27** - Galaxie 500 returned to the stage for an encore after a brilliant main set - they were joined by Kramer and played Ceremony, followed by Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste. I was mesmerised.

**1994**: I'd been messing around with the internet from pretty early on and towards the end of 1994 I acquired some free web space. But what to do? So I taught myself how to code for the web and built a Galaxie 500 web page, because I still remembered that feeling from four years before. I was now a webmaster!

I'd now been working in film stores ten years ... it was definitely looking like I was stuck there.

**1995**: I set up a mailing list for Galaxie 500 (and Luna and Damon & Naomi) fans.

**1999**: I'd managed to get a job working on a European digitisation project, I shared an office with BBC I&A's first _media managers_ who were then asked to help work on developing an intranet site for BBC Information & Archives - Research Central - I found myself roped in as the only person who had any experience developing for the web (**_becuase of Galaxie 500_**). I ended up doing quite a lot of the work on it. At some point it became my full time job.

Research Central changed over the years, it became research.gateway, and then Research Gateway - the job changed, the site changed - as people learned the web they needed less help and more tools - we gave them that.

**200?**: Actually I'm not sure exactly when, the powers that be decided that my skills (**_because of Galaxie 500_**) would be put to better use not as part of the archives but as part of the wider BBC intranet. Lots of people thought this was a good thing - but ... taking me away from archives wasn't good at all. Unfortunately over the following few years a variety of managers came and went and none of them had a clue what to do with us.

**2013**: After too many years of doing nothing and not getting anywhere I happened upon an advert for a job as the Webmaster at [The National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk). I applied for, and got, the job **_because of, you know... Galaxie 500_**. I was back in an archive. Home.

**2020**: 30 years on and I still get a buzz thinking about that show, 26 years on... still a webmaster.
