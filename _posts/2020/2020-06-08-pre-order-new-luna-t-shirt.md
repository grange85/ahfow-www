Luna have put up for [pre-order a new design T-shirt](https://kf-merch.com/collections/luna) - if you want a shirt you _must_ pre-order by 23rd of June:

> With all Luna's tour dates for 2020 being canceled, we have decided to make a limited edition version of the tour t-shirt that we had on our February 2020 dates. This "Moonphase" image was hand-drawn by [Mollie Tuggle](https://www.mollietuggle.com/). This is strictly a pre-order. Orders will be taken till June 23, when the amounts will be finalized, then manufactured by our old friends Tannis Root in North Carolina, and will ship out about a week later.

The shirt will be avialbale in either grey or _natural_ (or white as we used to call it?).
