On Thursday evening, ahead of Galaxie 500's Copenhagen arriving on vinyl for the first time on Saturday, (Damon Krukowski [@dada_drummer](https://twitter.com/dada_drummer)) will be on Twitter listening to the album and chatting/commenting on it - and answering questions. 

The online listening party will be hosted by [@newburycomics](https://twitter.com/newburycomics) and we'll all be pressing play at 7PM EDT on Thursday 27th August (that's midnight in the UK and Portugal and 1am in the rest of western Europe) - follow the hashtag [#Galaxie500xNewbury](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23galaxie500xnewbury).

Listen along using one of the following methods (or one of your own)

 - Your Galaxie 500 Copenhagen CD
 - [Galaxie 500 - Copenhagen on Bandcamp](https://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/album/copenhagen-live)
 - [Galaxie 500 - Copenhagen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/22j8SyiEyktiqQEQ0SBOkA?si=WrpUTjS-QF63uYVoqP7t3g)

Copenhagen will be hitting your [local indie record store of choice](https://recordstoreday.com/Stores) in the first of the Record Store Day _drops_ on Saturday - check with your store to find out how they're managing things in the current climate - some are opening physically while others will be doing online sales only. Good luck.
