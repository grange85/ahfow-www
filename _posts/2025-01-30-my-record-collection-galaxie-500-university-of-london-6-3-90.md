OK - this'll be a quick one because I haven't a clue what this is, or where it came from. It's a domestic VHS and on the label in marker pen is written "GALAXIE 500" and below it in biro is written "University of London 6-3-90" - but that date doesn't match with when Galaxie 500 played ULU (15-11-90) or indeed any time that Galaxie 500 played in London.

I don't have a VHS player at the moment so can't check. There are videos in existence of the following Galaxie 500 shows in London (that I'm aware of)...

- [Subterania - 27th June 1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozeRVpP4T0Q) - so that might match the month on this if it had been written using the ridiculous mm-dd-yy format that some folk use.
- [ULU 15th November 1990](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psk0ncyGtdE) - and that matches the **University of London** bit

So, it's probably one of those. There is even a possibility - since I couldn't check - that the previous [Galaxie 500 VHS in this series](/2024/09/30/my-record-collection-175-galaxie-500-at-ulu-vhs/) might not be ULU which is what I assumed. I do have another VHS with _both_ shows so... that'll be fine... and maybe I'll have got a charity shop VHS player in by then!
