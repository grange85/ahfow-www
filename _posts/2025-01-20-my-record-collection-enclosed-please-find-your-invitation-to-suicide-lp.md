This is the LP version of the Suicide tribute album put out by Spanish label Munster in 1994 that has Luna's cover of "Dream Baby Dream".

To be honest I was only superficially aware of Suicide before I bought the CD of this compilation in 1994, I knew of them but hadn't really paid that much attention to them, which is a shame because they'd have fitted more comfortably than I'd imagined alongside the metal I was mostly listening to around the time they were active.

This compilation is, I think, one of the better of the _tribute albums_ that became all the rage in the wake of [The Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge:_A_Tribute_to_Neil_Young) (the brainchild of [Terry Tolkin](/2022/01/25/rip-terry-tolkin/)), maybe because Suicide's music was more open to interpretation and so didn't end up being a record full of moderately straight copies. My only copy for a long time was the CD I bought around the time of release, and I was unaware that the LP version was ten tracks longer, maybe 26 tracks is a bit much... so I haven't actually popped it on the deck for quite a while.

As well as Luna you'll also find contributions from _friends of Luna_ Sonic Boom and Angel Corpus Christi, and a band called Zenith who are the two members of Mercury Rev who are still Mercury Rev.

I was lucky enough to see Suicide in 2010 when they supported Iggy & The Stooges at Hammersmith Odeon, I enjoyed them more than Iggy - here's a crap photo...

... and Marty Rev when he did a Unseen Warhol show in London with Dean in 2016, which I never took any photos at... even though I got backstage... too self-conscious!

I'm not too sure where/when I got this copy although suspect it was in the pile of goodies that Dean gave me when [I visited him in NYC back in 2001](/2023/06/01/my-record-collection-039-luna-live-lp/).

The 16 track CD version of [(Enclosed please find) Your Invitation to Suicide is on Bandcamp for virtually nothing](https://munsterrecords.bandcamp.com/album/your-invitation-to-suicide) - so worth a download (if downloading is your thing).
