This lovely EP was released to raise funds for Ptolemaic Terrascope ahead of the first Terrastock festival in Providence in April 1997.

As well as Damon & Naomi's {% ahfowtrack "14 Auspicious Dreams" %} it also has tracks by The Bevis Frond, Silver Apples and Flying Saucer Attack.

Damon & Naomi's track was co-written with the late Hugh Hopper of Soft Machine and I assume that the title refers to the Fourteen [Auspicious Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auspicious_dreams_in_Jainism) of Trishala, the mother of Mahavira, in the Indian religion of Jainism. Naomi's lyrics are a little difficult to decipher, and my knowledge of Jainism, and Trishala's dreams are garnered from Wikipedia and [this page which describes each of the dreams](https://oshwal.org.uk/14-auspicious-dreams-swapna-of-trishala-mata/), so I'm not sure how much of the religious symbolism made it into the song - it certainly seems to be very spiritual, if not directly religious... and it's very, very beautiful.

Naomi does use her [sruti box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shruti_box) on the song, so it does have some appropriate instrumentation (although, on second thoughts that might be her harmonium). I do seem to particularly love the songs where she plays the sruti, or her harmonium - see also [Spirit of Love](/2009/05/20/mp3-lost-tracks-5-damon-naomi-spirit-of-love/).

Oddly this track never made it onto the [Spirit of Love digital release](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/spirit-of-love-b-sides-bonuses-and-soundtracks) of Damon & Naomi rarities so, as far as I'm aware, the only place you can get _14 Auspicious Dreams_ is on a 7" single that was limited to 500 copies.

Hugh Hopper wrote {% ahfowtrack "Memories" %}, that Damon & Naomi covered on their first album [More Sad Hits](/database/damon-and-naomi/releases/more-sad-hits/), Hugh died in June 2009.
