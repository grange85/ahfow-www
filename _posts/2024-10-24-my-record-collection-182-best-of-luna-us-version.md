Best of Luna was released in 2006 and came in two very different versions, this is the US single CD version released by Rhino.

Since I did an album breakdown for [ROUNDUP](/2024/10/14/my-record-collection-179-luna-roundup-cd/) last week I should do the same for this one:

| Album                  |Best of Luna (US)  |ROUNDUP
|------------------------|-------------------|-------
| Penthouse              |5                  |4
| Bewitched              |4                  |2
| Lunapark               |3                  |1
| Pup Tent               |2                  |2
| The Days of Our Nights |1                  |3
| Rendezvous             |1                  |0 
| Romantica              |0                  |4
| non album track        |                   |1

Interesting that Romantica has no representaion and Rendezvous, an album Dean rated as the band's second best only gets one. Less interesting is perhaps that Days only gets one.

Perhaps, a propos of nothing at all... Rhino is part of Warner Music Group, as is/was Elektra...

 - Tracks from the four albums released by Elektra = 14 (avg 3.50 per album)
 - Tracks from the three albums not released by Elektra = 2 (avg 0.33 per album)

Also worth noting I guess is that around the same time Rhino also released a digital only release of cover versions _"Lunafied"_ which means that this album therefore has no covers, which does mean that we have an oddity that is a _Best of Luna_ without Indian Summer or Bonnie & Clyde!

I guess I'll revisit this when we come to looking at the Beggars Banquet version of _Best of Luna_.

The sleeve is a lovely drawing by [Adrian Tomine](http://www.adrian-tomine.com/Illustrations.html), there was a [limited edition signed print](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/sleeves/luna-best-of-luna-tomine-poster.jpg) of the cover on release, but it was too pricey for me... still kind of regret that though.
