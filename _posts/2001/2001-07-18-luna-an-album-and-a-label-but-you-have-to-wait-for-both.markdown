<p>Most (OK ALL) of this is leeched from DW's recently posted article on fuzzywuzzy - so if you want the full story go there.Luna's are hoping that their next album, provisionally titled "Romantica", will be released early 2002. The recording was done with Gene Holder (dB's) at his Jolly Roger Studio in Hoboken, NJ and was mixed by Dave Friddman (Mercury Rev) and Michael Ivins (Flaming Lips) in Freedonia, NY.As yet the band haven't signed a new record deal but there are offers on the table and they're expected to make a decision in the next couple of weeks.</p>
