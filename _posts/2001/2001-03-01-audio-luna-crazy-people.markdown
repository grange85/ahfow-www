This, as far as I'm aware is from Luna's only session for John Peel, recorded
on their first trip over in spring of 1992. I'm not too sure of the line up
for the session but Dean, Justin and Stanley had been joined by Mercury Rev's
Grasshopper for their London show 2 days before (see Track of the Month - June
2000).  
The rest of the session contained I Can't Wait, That's What You Always Say and
Slide
