<p>I've now implemented a rating system so that you can rank any of the albums/singles etc. in the discography between 0 (crap) and 5 (fab). You can vote as many times as you wish my thinking being if you think the avg. score is to low bump it up.Go to whatever section of the discography you care for and a rating form should be displayed to the left of the sleeve scan - pop in your score, hit rate and hey presto you have made a contribution!</p>
