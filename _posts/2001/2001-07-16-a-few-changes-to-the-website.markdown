<p>I've made a few additions to the web site - mainly fixing what I had broken...The guestbook has been re-launched, the last one kept failing on me so I just pasted in somebody elses hard work rather than trying to do my own - seems to be OK but any problems get onto me.I've added a discussion forum - this is just a trial and will be removed if it doesn't take off - I popped this up because the old discussion forum (set up by someone else) recently sank without trace.I'm always open to suggestions so if there's something you suspect this site could use please let me know.</p>
