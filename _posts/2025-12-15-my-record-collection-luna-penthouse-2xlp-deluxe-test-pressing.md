In 2017 a beautiful double LP of Luna's masterpiece Penthouse was released on Record Store Day and [I've already written about](/2023/03/20/my-record-collection-018-luna-penthouse-deluxe-2xlp/) the copy that Dean sent me. This is a test pressing of that release.

Jason Reynolds has a long Luna history - it was his label Summershine from Melbourne in Australia, that was the only one to release [a copy of Luna's first album on LP](/2025/04/07/my-record-collection-luna-lunapark-summershine-lp/) (and also a [7" single of Indian Summer](/2025/01/27/my-record-collection-luna-indian-summer-ride-into-the-sun/)). He was also working for Warners when the deluxe Penthouse was released and was its "reissue producer".

I've been a social media _friend/follower_ of Jason for quite a long time and back in June he messaged me on Instagram - "I did just discover I had some spares of the test pressing of the Penthouse Deluxe 2LP [...] let me know if it's of any interest to you!" ... it of course was very much of interest!

Now, if you follow [Jason on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chordsoffame/) you'll notice that he does a lot of travelling for his work and had an upcoming UK trip and was kind enough to bring a copy over and post it to me from London, sadly I didn't get a chance to meet him and at the very least buy him a coffee as thanks. I hope to some day!

The release was of course amazing, Penthouse deserved a special release and this was really special - Dean described the album to me as "the best-sounding vinyl version out there" and it really is.

I have been really lucky over the years with the folk I've encountered thanks to my love of these bands.
