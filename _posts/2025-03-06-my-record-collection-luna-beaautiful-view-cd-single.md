Another single from Pup Tent, I forgot when I [posted about IHOP](/2025/02/20/my-record-collection-luna-ihop/) a couple of weeks back that there had been a third. This one didn't get a vinyl release though.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/luna-beautiful-view-cd-single.jpg" "Luna - Beautiful View (single)" %}

The CD came in a card sleeve with another of David Levinthal's _Western_ photos - this one of the cowboy entering the saloon taken from behind - I've always assumed he was leaving the saloon on the cover of the album, although I guess it could be the other way round?

As well as the lead track the single also has the $7000 "U.S. radio edit" of Bobby Peru:

<blockquote>
<p>The radio department guys agreed that "Bobby Peru" would be the sec-ond single, but recommended that we first do a special radio-friendly mix, to pump it up and make it ready for the airwaves. Ren√©e called the famous producer and mixer Bob Clearmountain. He had produced some amazing records-he mixed Avalon by Roxy Music, and Tattoo You, the last great Stones album. Tattoo You is only half great (side two), but I'll take five or six great Stones songs any day.</p>

<p>The multitrack tapes for "Bobby Peru" were sent out to Clearmountain in California, and for about seven thousand dollars he punched it up, adding a little extra compression and turning up the drums and the vocals. Now the radio department people felt a lot better about delivering it to radio sta-tions, because it had been mixed by Bob Clearmountain, who knew a thing or two about hit records. Another seven thousand dollars added to the Luna tab.</p>

It also has a live version of _California (All The Way)_ - just called _California_ on the sleeve. I've [written about (and shared) this track previously](/2012/03/23/audio-lost-tracks-california-live-luna/) discussing its uncertain provenance - maybe someone in the know would care to elaborate?
