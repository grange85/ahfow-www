Back in January 2024 Andrew mentioned that a friend of his was looking to off-load some Galaxie 500 memorabilia and asked if I'd be interested... which of course I was, as well as a couple of posters there was this VHS that contained the three videos of full concerts from UK shows.

As I've mentioned before I am currently without a VHS machine and so have been unable to watch them when they turn up in this series - I will maybe revisit them when I find a decent and cheap charity shop player. Fortunately this has nothing that hasn't already found it into the digital realm.

As listed on the photocopied sleeve the three shows are:

    Live at the University of london (U. L. U.) 13.6.90. Superb Quality - Full concert 70m.

This was such _superb quality_ that it got officially released on the [Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste DVD](/2024/11/11/my-record-collection-187-don-t-let-our-youth-go-to-waste-dvd/) a few years back. It also might have [put in an appearance in this series on a VHS](/2025/01/30/my-record-collection-galaxie-500-university-of-london-6-3-90/) before, but no VHS player meant I couldn't be sure. I was at this gig... there was [no booing](/2025/08/07/my-record-collection-galaxie-500-this-is-our-music-japanese-cd/)!

    Live at Leicester University 6.2.90 (As support to Birdland). Full concert 30 minutes.

This was actually supporting The Sundays, it seems Birdland played the same venue the following night so that may be where the confusion lies. This was shared again a couple of years ago described as _unknown date and unknown venue_ which was briefly quite exciting until it was identified as a boot that had been doing the rounds for many years!

    Live at Subteranea, London 27.6.90, Full concert 70 minutes.

Another show I was at and [wrote up for my Substack a couple of months back](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/galaxie-500-at-the-subterania-27th) about how it changed my life!

<blockquote>
<p>The Subterania was a club located underneath the Westway in west London. Most gigs around then were happening in north London or the West End so it was nice having a venue a little closer to home so we saw quite a few gigs there over the years (although I somehow managed to not see Galaxie 500’s first gig there the previous year).</p>

<p>To be honest I can’t really remember the specifics of Galaxie 500’s set, but, main set over, at approx 22:30 Galaxie 500 returned to the stage for an encore, they were joined by Kramer and played Ceremony, followed by Don’t Let Our Youth Go To Waste. I was mesmerised.</p>

Since I don't have a VHS player I can't check this out - the video on YouTube that claims to be from the Subterania show is actually from the Manchester show the night before - so I suspect that this might be that - although... that video is incomplete and only 50 minutes long and this claims to be 70 minutes long. 

Now, The Subterania had a balcony that wasn't often open (in my experience) but at one gig - and I _think_ it was this one - Ken and I managed to get upstairs even though we shouldn't have, and there were a couple of lads setting up a video recorder so I suspect that there is a recording of that gig somewhere - we were ushered down pretty quickly. I also remember being at Camden Market not long after this gig and seeing, but crazily not buying, a Galaxie 500 bootleg video (although it could easily have been the Manchester show).

Maybe the elusive video of Galaxie 500 at The Subterania is the one on this tape!? I suspect not.
