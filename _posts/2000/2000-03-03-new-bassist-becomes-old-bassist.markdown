Luna's replacement for Justin Harwood, Matt Quigley, has left the band after
just one month. In a post to the Galaxie 500 mailing list he said that he had
been told that things were "not working out". He went on to add that "I got
the gig simply because we were friends. Truthfully, I'm far from the most
sympathetic player when it comes to the Justin/ Luna style". Which means that
Luna must be on the lookout for a new bassist. Best of luck to Matt as an ex-
member of Luna
