<p>Luna's Fuzzy Wuzzy website finally had an update this week and there on the news page was this... "Justin Harwood is taking a leave of absence from his LUNA duties -- he has returned to New Zealand to prepare for the arrival of a baby in his life. LUNA will continue to tour the United States this spring, and have recruited New Yorker Matt Quigley, formerly of Vaganza, and Skunk, to fill in on the bass guitar."I guess that makes Dean the sole surviving original member</p>
