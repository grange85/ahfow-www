Another new bassist installed - 6/March/2000

Luna's third bassist of the year has been welcomed into the fold - this is lifted from fuzzywuzzy - 

> LUNA have recruited a new bassist for their upcoming Spring tour. Britta Phillips, formerly of Belltower, also plays with Atlanta band Ultrababyfat. Her first show with the band will be at the Paradise in Boston in late March

It seems Ms Phillips has had an interesting past which can be pawed through in traditional obsessive style at the following internet sites - first [a bit about Belltower](https://web.archive.org/web/20000306+/http://www.angelfire.com/md/shoegazing/belltower.html), and more unusually at the [The Britta Phillips Internet Fan Club](https://web.archive.org/web/20000306+/https://web.archive.org/web/19991105080356/http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Towers/2465/Britta.htm).
