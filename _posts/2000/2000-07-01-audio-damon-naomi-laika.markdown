<p>Terrastock was a 3 day festival to benefit the British underground rock magazine Ptolemaic Terrascope. It was held in Providence RI over the weekend of the 24th-26th of April. Damon & Naomi opened the second day, and also, as part of Magic Hour, were the "surprise" special guests who closed the festival.<br />Unfortunately Terrastock was too far away for a poor media-worker like myself to travel to so all I have is a tape of this performance, sent to me by Tom Rapp (who joined Damon & Naomi on stage for the set closer (Dylan's "I Shall Be Released") and who had covered D & N's Tour Of The World during his own set). That performance of "I Shall Be Released" was released on the CD All Access that came with a commemorative issue of Ptolemaic Terrascope.<br />There have been two subsequent Terrastock festivals, and a fourth is planned for Seattle this year.</p>
