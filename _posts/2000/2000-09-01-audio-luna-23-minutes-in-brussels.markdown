<p>Probably the best Luna show I was at. The good reviews in the UK press that Penthouse had received must have contributed to the large and enthusiastic turnout. Luna seemed comfortable and played a long (in my Luna experience at least) set of over 80 minutes.<br />23 Minutes in Brussels closed the main set and was one of the many high points of an exceptional show.</p>
