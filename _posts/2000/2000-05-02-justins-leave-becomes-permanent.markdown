Britta Phillips, who has played with Luna on their recent tour is installed on a more permanent basis. Here's the official word Fuzzywuzzy"After eight years and five albums with Luna, founding member Justin Harwood is permanently relocating to his native New Zealand, where his wife has just given birth to a baby girl. Justin will not be returning to Luna.We wish him the very best, and we will miss him. Replacing Justin on bass is Britta Phillips, who has been touring with Luna this past March"</p>
