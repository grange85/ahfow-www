ROUNDUP was a promotional CD that Luna put out around the time of Romantica which I guess means that this is the first Luna "Best of" album.

This is how the albums stack up on this:

|Romantica|	4|
|Penthouse|	4|
|The Days of Our Nights|	3|
|Pup Tent|	2|
|Bewitched|	2|
|Lunapark|	1|
|non album track|	1|

So... _Days..._ is clearly punching above its weight there? Although that's somewhat skewed by _Sweet Child..._ which wasn't supposed to be on the album.

The tracks from Lunapark to Pup Tent are "courtesy of Elektra Entertainment Group" and the tracks from Romantica are "courtesy of Jetset Records" but the tracks from Days seem OK to use without any credit.

Dean sent me a handful of these CDs when they were released, around July 2002 with a note on a postcard that read "hope you're doing well. Maybe see you in October. Our manager printed up 500 of these CDs". I gave away a few as end of year survey prizes but still have two copies... the second of which will be making an appearance later.
