Luna's cover of Donovan's _Season of The Witch_ was recorded for the film _I Shot Andy Warhol_ and is the opening track on [the soundtrack album](/2023/11/30/my-record-collection-091-i-shot-andy-warhol/). Beggars Banquet released this single around the time of the film's release in 1996.

The b-side contains the three tracks recorded during a live session in Manchester on Mark Radcliffe's Radio 1 show on the 13th December 1995. You can hear the full session, including the between songs banter, here:
