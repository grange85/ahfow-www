I guess for those of us who have been waiting for months and have received nothing, it will come as no surprise that Bandbox, who released the live Bewitched, Penthouse, and Rendezvous albums have gone to the wall. I suspect everyone who has been waiting will have received the notification but... just in case:

<blockquote>
Bandbox is filing an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors. They are doing this in order to allow a court supervised process to liquidate the company’s assets and distribute the proceeds according to priorities established in law. 
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Email - 6th March 2024</p>

<blockquote>
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, on February 23, 2024, Bandbox LLC, a Minnesota
limited liability company (“Assignor”), entered into an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors
under Chapter 577 of the Minnesota Statutes (the “Assignment”) with Lighthouse Management
Group, Inc. (the “Assignee”), which has been accepted by the Assignee. The Assignee filed the
Assignment with the Hennepin County District Court for the State of Minnesota on February 28,
2024, at 4:33 p.m., in Court File No. 27-CV-24-3203. You are receiving this notice because the
Assignee believes you may be a creditor or other party in interest with respect to the Assignor
and/or its property
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Notice of Assignment - you can see the <a href="https://bandboxrocks.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3f0b1055e227d782988c8e548&id=13939cd247&e=8cc35b2c65">full notice here</a></p>

The [full case details are here](https://publicaccess.courts.state.mn.us/CaseSearch/ViewCaseDetails?roa=wn%2Bq%2BoVD0JUQ4DoaT2eqYePBkVY4lpmRbob7kCV2DcLYW2gF9LWQuXW5wYJ%2B02%2FSuOC85l3gqHvR87ATJZQHYA%3D%3D).

Things started getting suspicious when they stopped replying to email in mid-January (and maybe the frantic off-loading of stock just after xmas might have been a clue?).

Good luck trying to get some money back. I'm not holding my breath...
