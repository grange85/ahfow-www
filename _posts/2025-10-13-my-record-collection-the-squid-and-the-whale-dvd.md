I already posted about the [CD release of the soundtrack of The Squid and the Whale](/2023/08/28/my-record-collection-064-the-squid-and-the-whale/) a couple of years ago and might have considered the film covered by that except that while writing that post I commented on how little actual Dean and Britta was on it. Britta, on the mailing list in 2005, assured us that there was more of their music in the film:

<blockquote>
We had 8 cues in the movie. The 2 main themes recur 3 times (each time with a slightly different arrangement), and we did a version of one of the Bert Jansch songs (without vocals) as well as that version of “Love On A Real Train.”
</blockquote>

So... based on that I guess I'd better re-watch the film... and listen harder. I last watched the film way back in 2006 when we saw it at the BFI (I think). I rated it 7/10 then which I guess is why I haven't gone back to it... so, I'll hit play now.

So... the problem I have with The Squid and the Whale is that I really like a film to make some sense to me and The Squid and the Whale doesn't - I don't understand the characters and the way they behave. While I appreciate the film as a story, and it is brilliantly told and acted, I can't imagine a world where people behave the way they do - so it's not a film I can love. I suspect this may be a regional/national disconnect? Maybe Americans, or even more precisely New Yorkers, will understand it better, and maybe even see the humour that the critics always mention, all I see is horrible people behaving horribly to one another. And that's not funny.

Maybe it helps a little that the actors are so perfect - Laura Linney in particular - but pretty much everyone is so well played, even if I don't really _like_ any of them!

The soundtrack is exceptional, all well chosen and perfectly placed, and it's always nice to hear Dean & Britta's contributions which are pretty recognisable now, but suspect on first viewing in 2006, would have been more difficult.

Second viewing I've dropped it to a 5/10 - being in the cinema is almost always worth a point, and my ratings across the board have become harsher in the last nineteen&dagger; years, so I imagine my opinion of the film is pretty much the same as it was on first viewing. 

After my post about the soundtrack a discussion ensued that eventually led to about 19 minutes of The Squid and the Whale related music being posted on Dean and Britta's Patreon over the course of a couple of months. You need to be a patron to hear them, and since their Patreon is on pause I'm not sure if you can.

<blockquote>
This month's music is thanks to Andy Aldridge, who suggested we post our score from The Squid & the Whale soundtrack album, since our tracks have mysteriously disappeared from the streaming services.

Here's Dean's version of Pink Floyd's {% ahfowtrack "Hey You" %} which is a key song in the film (but not Dean's cover):

And {% ahfowtrack "Family Conference" %} developed into {% ahfowtrack "The Sun is Still Sunny" %} on Dean & Britta's Back Numbers released a couple of years after the film. I love this clip of them performing it in a stairwell for La Blogotheque in 2006:

If I want to watch a Noah Baumbach film I'm likely to reach for Frances Ha, or Mistress America - I still don't really understand those people, but they seem more likeable (sometimes) and I find them funnier.

I don't yet have a DVD of Mistress America (which doesn't seem to have had a UK release) but Frances Ha will be turning up later in the series.
