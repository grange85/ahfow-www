This is the Video Arts Japan release of Galaxie 500's live album Copenhagen that was released along with the three studio albums in lovely pseudo vinyl sleeves.

Like the others in the series it came with an insert which had the lyrics to all the songs (including the covers) in both English and Japanese and extensive sleeve notes - just in Japanese. Thanks to Google Translate I now know that the first set of sleeve notes, about the band, are a tweaked version of the ones [Byron Coley wrote for the box set website](https://static.fullofwishes.co.uk/galaxie500box/pr1.html) in 1996.

The second set of notes, about the album, were written for the Japanese release by Ryuichi Kanagawa (apologies if Google Translate got that wrong) - I've popped what Google made of it [over here](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/docs/japanese-copenhagen-sleeve-notes-google-translate.txt), you can get the gist but it really needs a proper translator!

Dean sent me a complete set of these discs before release - signed on the Obi strip.
