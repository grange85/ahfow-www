Nat at Sonic Cathedral was (and still is) very good to me, so would invariably send me a test pressing of Dean's releases on his fabulous label. This is one of them.

This was sent to me along with my order of the single, and the [test pressing of Emnacipated Hearts](/2024/03/14/my-record-collection-118-dean-wareham-emancipated-hearts-test-pressing/) that I've posted about before.

Since I've written about the single here's a few of my favourite Sonic Cathedral releases that have no (obvious) AHFoW connection

 - The very lovely **Deary** have been releasing their beautiful music on Sonic Cathedral, often in lovely limited editions that I'm rarely quick enough off the ball to catch - although I have managed to catch a couple... and just remembered to fill my digital boots with the gaps. Last year's [Aurelia](https://deary.bandcamp.com/album/aurelia) is as good a place to start as any.
 - Gulp are Guto Pryce, of Super Furry Animals, and singer Lindsey Leven, and their first LP [Season Sun](https://gulp1.bandcamp.com/album/season-sun) was released by Sonic Cathedral in 2014.
 - [Red Sunset Dreams](https://mark-peters.bandcamp.com/album/red-sunset-dreams) was Mark Peters (of Engineers) second solo album and is an absolute gem, His first album [Innerland](https://mark-peters.bandcamp.com/album/innerland-large-scale-version) is also very lovely.
 - Dot Allison released her 2023 album [Consciousology](https://dotallison.bandcamp.com/album/consciousology) on Sonic Cathedral - she also guests on Mark Peters Red Sunset Dreams.

There is of course so much more to love in [Sonic Cathedral's catalogue](https://soniccathedral.bandcamp.com/) so take a look if you haven't already.
