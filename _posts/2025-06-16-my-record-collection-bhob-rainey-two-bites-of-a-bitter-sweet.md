Bhob Rainey has toured and recorded with Damon & Naomi over a number of years, this is a single released by Evolving Ear Records in 2006 and contains two five minute sound experiments and, because of that, is not something I play all that often!

I often scour/search for any mentions of Galaxie 500 and it's former members and in 2006 it landed me [on this blog post](https://7inches.blogspot.com/2006/11/bhob-rainey-7.html) which quoted the Evolving Ear press release which contained this section:

<blockquote>
Two Bites of a Bitter Sweet is his first release of purely electronic music, and Evolving Ear is tickled to be the messenger on this one. The material on the two side-long, 33rpm pieces ranges from homemade synth textures to field recordings from Lisbon, Venice, Huelva, and other, unremembered locations. There's some singing by <strong>Naomi Yang (Damon and Naomi)</strong> and Bhob himself, and some words of wisdom from Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Overall, a woozy alternate reality is offered for repeated dream pool swims. Beautiful, hallucinatory artwork by Elaine Kaufmann. Two Bites of a Bitter Sweet Bhob Rainey EE17 - 7" vinyl

Although... the singing, if it is singing, is buried in amongst all the other noise going on. It is also uncredited - and so, if I hadn't come across that blog post it almost certainly wouldn't be in my collection because... I wouldn't have known!

<blockquote>
The two sides of this release, "A Desert of Consolation" and "The Summering Unsound", both follow a singular form: an ambiguously intensifying exposition followed by an unfolding of previously hidden elements. The materials, however, could not be more different: "A Desert of Consolation" consists almost entirely of synthetic sounds lying in a narrow frequency band, while "The Summering Unsound" is made up of a good deal of untreated field recordings, beats, and broadband noise. And, though I followed my dictum of simplicity in the pieces' trajectories, I couldn't stop myself from piling a lot of layers into the mix. So, there's a simple, if perverse, horizontal unfolding, and a morass of detail vertically. Kinda like a nice pile of fall leaves with a rake and skeleton hidden inside.

The other Bhob Rainey purchase I have is from/about another of his projects The BSC which is three 20+ minute improvisations, and a 100+ page book (mine in PDF form) that analyses and comments on it - the first piece is called _With Pauline Oliveros_ and was recorded (I suppose unsurprisingly) with the late, pioneering, experimental composer/musician [Pauline Oliveros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Oliveros) at EMPAC (Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center) in 2009. Damon contributed what Bhob described as a "series of prose poems" to the book.
