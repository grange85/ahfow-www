This is the fourth and last copy of Magic Hour's first album No Excess is Absurd, and is also the tenth and last appearance by Magic Hour in this series.

This is the Twisted Village limited edition box, limited to 1000 copies (which seems quite a lot) each numbered - mine is #0448. The package is a lovely silver-coloured card box about 1.5cm deep. Inside the box is the CD in a transparent paper sleeve and a small 12 page booklet... and three fat pieces of cardboard to fill the empty space in the box. It is lovely but it would have been nice if that empty space had been filled with something beautiful because the disc and booklet could have easily fitted into a card sleeve meaning there was no real reason to put it in a box.

The box is however a sweet thing, and vastly superior to a jewel case.  The CD has a vintage image of some beautiful astrological mumbo-jumbo on it (the [Ch&eacute; CD](/2023/06/26/my-record-collection-046-magic-hour-no-excess-is-absurd/) had a very dull design) and the booklet also has more lovely vintage nonsense - here's what Google Lens tells me:

The package was designed by Naomi and is of course lovely (if lovely nonsense) and is reminiscent of her [Galaxie 500 box set](/2025/11/06/my-record-collection-galaxie-500-galaxie-500-aka-box-set/) from a couple of years later.
