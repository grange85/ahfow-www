<p>Luna have been dropped by their US label Elektra on the eve of the release of their 5th album - in an interview with UK newspaper The Independent Dean Wareham said "Now they're not even putting our album out. Dropped, man! They said it's 'not commercially viable'. We wanted out of Elektra a while ago, partly because of this mountain of fake debt that they slapped on us. And it is fake! But the timing is bad because we'd serviced the album to the press"In another report it was stated that "an Elektra representative has confirmed that the band has parted company with the label and is now searching for a new home with the completed album in tow."Obviously the US release of Days of Our Nights is very much up in the air. Luna are still signed to Beggars Banquet in the UK and Europe and the album has been released as scheduled to (almost) universal praise.</p>
