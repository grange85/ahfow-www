<p>I arrived and caught most of the support act, Tram (I think) and was sufficiently impressed, but for them persistently giving their songs fake endings, which is frustrating for a keen audience, and I can\'t believe it\'s not frustrating for the band.</p>
<p>Damon & Naomi took to the stage and played another enjoyable set, covering pretty much the same ground as they for the two previous shows, a gorgeous \"Laika\" was one of the high points. They also played a genuinely new song \"so new we\'re still fighting over the lyrics\". \"Mirror Phase\" saw Damon & Naomi alternating the vocal which was quite unusual but effective.</p>
<p>Another fine performance.</p>
<p>If I have one criticism of these three shows it\'s that none of them were long enough, Terrastock obviously had a tight schedule to stick to, but the other two shows would have benefited from maybe shorter support acts or a later curfew to allow Damon & Naomi to put in a show over an hour long. Having said that I\'ve been treated to three very good shows in eight days so I guess I shouldn\'t really complain.</p>
