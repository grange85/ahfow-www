<p>The lift is in a slightly grotty upstairs room of a pub in the very cool south coast resort of Brighton, having arrived too early (first ones in) we sat through an overlong set by a support act who had a couple of favourable points - a pleasant sound and one occasionally special voice - but one major negative point - a frustrating lack of variety. Two songs in I was enjoying, ten songs in I was tearing my hair out.</p>
<p>Damon & Naomi arrived on stage, set up their gear and proceeded to battle through sound problems and deliver a fine set. The Brighton air had obviously given them a more relaxed outlook to the point that the feeding back was almost acceptable. A healthy bunch of oldies including \"New York City\", \"This Car...\", \"Information Age\" were mixed in with a couple of new songs, \"I Dreamed of the Caucasus\" and \"Judah and The Macabees\" plus a delightfully beautiful take on Big Star's \"Blue Moon\". Not a gem of a show but one to wipe the memory of the previous years awkward Dingwalls performance.</p>
