Dean Wareham has just shared a second track from his new album which will be released in March. The song is the title track of the album "That's the Price of Loving Me". The song has been released with a lovely video of Dean wandering around LA.

<blockquote>
We filmed this over the holidays in and around Echo Park. Matthew and I thought for this romantic but contemplative song it would be fun to shoot me doing some romantic activities but all my myself, so here I am, shopping for books, taking a paddle boat ride in the Echo Park lake, eating a cheeseburger. The burger joint, by the way, was the iconic Patra Burger on Sunset Blvd, a local lunch spot since the 1970s which sadly closed down for good just a few days after we filmed.
