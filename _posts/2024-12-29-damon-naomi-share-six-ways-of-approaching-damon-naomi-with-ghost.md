Over on Damon's Substack he has celebrated the 25th anniversary of the recording of [with Ghost]() by sharing the track notes from the original Sub Pop release of the album back in 2000.

<blockquote>
<p>Twenty-five years ago this week, the Tokyo band Ghost came to our home and we recorded an album together in the living room.</p>

<p>When Sub Pop released the album on CD (Drag City pressed the LP cause Sub Pop wasn’t making vinyl then, what a time it was!), they hired Byron Coley to write the bio and track notes. These texts seem tailor-made for a publication called Dada Drummer Almanach so I’m resharing them here in honor of the anniversary.</p>

With Ghost, like all of Damon & Naomi's albums, [is available on their Bandcamp](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/damon-naomi-with-ghost) for _pay what you want_.

Damon has just added a [subscription layer to his Substack](https://dadadrummer.substack.com/subscribe) 

<blockquote>
<p>The listening suggestions in this newsletter seem to have proven useful for some, however. So I’m hoping they might give more of you an excuse, if not a reason, to support Dada Drummer Almanach financially.</p>

<p>To bolster those recommendations, I’ll be building out a new paywalled section of the newsletter with more information I gather and have gathered over the years about recorded music, and recording musicians.</p>
