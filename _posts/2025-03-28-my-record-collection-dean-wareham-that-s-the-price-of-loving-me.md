The Royal Mail have informed me that they _"have received [my] parcel from Norman Records. Delivery is due: Friday, 28 March 2025 Delivery is estimated between: 08:50 and 14:27"_ - as I write this it's 08:50. Hopefully I won't be let down...

Dean's fourth solo album seems to have arrived hot on the heels of the third... I checked, and was shocked that [I Have Nothing to Say...](/2024/06/27/my-record-collection-148-dean-wareham-i-have-nothing-to-say-to-the-mayor-of-la-cd/) is actually over three years old... where _does_ the time go!? The album was [announced in early January](/2025/01/09/dean-wareham-announces-new-solo-album-that-s-the-price-of-loving-me/) and much was made of Dean working with Kramer for the first time since Galaxie 500's [This Is Our Music]().

A couple of days back Dean and Britta (and the label Carpark Records) took part in a Bandcamp listening party which was quite fun. I am rather fond of these listening parties as a way to listen with others and to get a little insight into the album from the folk involved in making it. You can see the [listening party comments](https://deanwareham.bandcamp.com/live/thats-the-price-of-loving-me-listening-party) here although they sadly aren't timestamped so you have to sort of guess where you are when some comments are made - e.g. "3 solos at once" or "this was so much fun to record"). I've [popped up an edited version](/articles/2025-03-26-thats-the-price-listening-party-edit/) and put in which track I think was playing at the time.

OK... 16:00 and the Royal Mail have finally delivered the LP - this is the "limited edition clear vinyl" edition, but I'm not sure how _limited_ and cynical me suspects that _not very_ is how limited. 

The album comes in a glossy card sleeve with an equally glossy card printed inner sleeve which carries on the **D E A N** from the front cover with **W A R E** on one side of the insert which has another nice pic of Dean, and **H A M** on the other side, along with the printed lyrics.

No download though. I think it's sad that most records don't come with a download these days.

The album, of course is beautiful, lots of lovely instrumentation and Dean's voice seems to get richer with each release! First listen faves are {% ahfowtrack "New World Julie" %} (which Dean described as "[trying] to be optimistic" during the listening party; and {% ahfowtrack "That's the Price of Loving Me" %} which also has that lovely video, with Dean's lonely swan boat ride.

{% ahfowvideo "XY6QWz79K-U" "That's the Price of Loving Me" %}

I notice that Britta has a co-writing credit for all of the songs (except the covers obv) - Dean alone was credited on _I Have Nothing to Say_.
