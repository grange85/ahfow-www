The Sub Pop Years was released in August 2009 and is a compilation of tracks from the albums Damon & Naomi released for Sub Pop starting with their second album _The Wondrous World of Damon & Naomi_ and finishing with the "live" album _Song to The Siren_.

The CD came in a lovely gatefold card case with a fold-out insert. The insert has descriptions of each of the albums that made up the duo's Sub Pop years and was, I think, the first time they openly admitted that Live in San Sebastian was in fact recorded live in their living room in Cambridge, MA (with a crowd dubbed on from a show in San Francisco).

The CD of The Sub Pop Years is a lovely package, with a wonderful track list and is still [available to buy from D&N's website](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/damon-naomi-the-sub-pop-years) - I'd very highly reccomend it - particularly if you haven't bought anything since More Sad Hits (which the AHFoW annual survey always suggested was the case).

Obv also available for [pay what you can on Bandcamp](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/the-sub-pop-years-1995-2002).
