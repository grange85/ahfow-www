<p>You can pre-order the book from the web site in two forms - either as a signed and numbered copies for $13 (limited to 88 copies) or a very special version that includes a signed and numbered book plus of the sixteen photographs printed at high quality and signed by Naomi - <a href="http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/catalog/browse/afterimage/">this can be pre-ordered from the Ugly Duckling web site for $125</a> - each photograph will be printed only once and you get to choose which one you'd like - better be fast if you're interested - last check (2011-09-26) there were 11 still available.</p>
