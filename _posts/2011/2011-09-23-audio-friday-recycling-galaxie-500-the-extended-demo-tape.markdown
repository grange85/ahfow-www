I think I've posted most (although possibly not all) of these tracks separately before but here they are all collected together for your enjoyment.

When the Galaxie 500 Box Set was released in 1996 one of the main treats was the [three tracks from Galaxie 500's first demo](https://static.fullofwishes.co.uk/galaxie500box/discog1.html) - what was a little bit of a surprise (to me at least) was to discover a couple of years later that a few of these demo tapes were compiled with four extra tracks - these had a very limited circulation but eventually a copy made it into my grubby paws.

The four extra tracks are as follows:

{% ahfowaudio {
"audiourl": "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/audio/galaxie-500-pride-extended-demo.mp3",
"audiocap": "Galaxie 500 - Pride (demo)",
"sourceurl": "https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/galaxie-500/releases/galaxie-500-demo-cassette/",
"sourcecap": "Galaxie 500 - Demo cassette"
} %}

{% ahfowaudio {
"audiourl": "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/audio/05-galaxie-500-on-the-sofa.mp3",
"audiocap": "Galaxie 500 - On The Sofa (demo)",
"sourceurl": "https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/galaxie-500/releases/galaxie-500-demo-cassette/",
"sourcecap": "Galaxie 500 - Demo cassette"
} %}

{% ahfowaudio {
"audiourl": "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/audio/06-galaxie-500-open-road.mp3",
"audiocap": "Galaxie 500 - Open Road (demo)",
"sourceurl": "https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/galaxie-500/releases/galaxie-500-demo-cassette/",
"sourcecap": "Galaxie 500 - Demo cassette"
} %}

{% ahfowaudio {
"audiourl": "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/audio/07-galaxie-500-well-all-right.mp3",
"audiocap": "Galaxie 500 - Well All Right (demo)",
"sourceurl": "https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/galaxie-500/releases/galaxie-500-demo-cassette/",

If you want to hear the first three tracks - go buy Uncollected - it has so many gems on it.
