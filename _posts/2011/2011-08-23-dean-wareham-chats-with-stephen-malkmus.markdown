<p>In Salon <a href="http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/feature/2011/08/22/malkmus_wareham/index.html">Dean Wareham interviews Stephen Malkmus</a> about songwriting and working with Beck on the latest album by Stephen Malkmus and The Jicks, Mirror Traffic. The album is <a href="http://www.dominorecordco.com/artists/stephen-malkmus-and-the-jicks/">out on Domino Records</a> today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DW</strong> That must be why I feel worthless lately. I read this on Wikipedia, that during the "Terror Twilight" sessions, Pavement’s last album, you spent a lot of time playing Scrabble. Luna, on our fourth album, we set up a Scrabble table in the middle of the recording studio. It was bad.</p>
<p><strong>SM</strong> I guess it’s better than smoking crack. It’s a version of that for your mind.</p>
