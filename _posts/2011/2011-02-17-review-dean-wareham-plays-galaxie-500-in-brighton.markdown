<p>A UK tour without including London... that's not only ridiculous but put me in a tricky position... which show would I go to, I eventually picked the easiest of the dates. My dad lives in West Sussex so I thought I'd take a couple of days of work and combine the show with a visit... and I'd have someone to drive me to and from the show meaning I didn't have to skip off early to catch the last train.</p>
<p>We arrived in Brighton early and headed off to the Komedia to see if we could catch Dean & Britta soundchecking. We arrived and slipped in. I introduced my dad to the band (and being my dad he instantly became more comfortable with them than I ever could). I still can't quite get over the weirdness that I am able to do that... go to a soundcheck... with my dad - ok the last bit might seem a bit sad but... go to a soundcheck!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/5454352150/" title="Soundcheck: Dean & Britta by grange85, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5454352150_f66a886cac.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Soundcheck: Dean & Britta"  class="aligncenter" /></a></p>
<p>Soundcheck over, dad scrounged a beer, told Britta her hat looked silly and told Dean about seeing Bill Haley and the Comets... I stood by, quiet and uncomfortable!</p>
<p>After a bite to eat it was show time... first up <a href="http://www.echolakeband.com/">Echo Lake</a> - they made lots of noise... in an MBV sort of way -  some of it good, some of it probably hampered by the venue. And the five of them looked uncomfortably cramped on the stage.</p>
<p>Next were <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ringodeathstarr" title="Ringo Deathstarr - warning Myspace link">Ringo Deathstarr</a>, I'd been warned to expect volume from a number of sources (notably in <a href="http://follyfollyfolly.blogspot.com/2011/02/dean-wareham-plays-galaxie-500-ruby.html">Folly of Youth's review of the Manchester show</a>). They were loud, lots of loud, but somehow their loud managed better with the venue than that of Echo Lake... but after just 3 or 4 songs (and less then 30 mins) they were done. I could have done with more (although not at the expense of the headliners!).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/5453741035/" title="Dean by grange85, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5134/5453741035_4e345b1e64.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Dean"  class="aligncenter" /></a>
<p>Dean, Britta and Jason took to the stage, the sound wasn't great, I think it would have been better from further back but I decided to see the band and so stood at the front. A great set, very little between song banter from Dean, and a smallish but very enthusiastic crowd (my dad guesstimated about 300). No surprises in the set list. High point in a set of highs was Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste. Finished with a blissful Ceremony and another show was over.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkb0-uupszA"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/dw-ceremony-vid.jpg" alt="" title="dw-ceremony-vid" width="300" height="162" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2145" /></a></p>
<p>Chatted briefly with Dean & Britta after the show - Dean asked whether I preferred the show as a three piece or a four piece. My under-pressure answer was "erm... four piece" but that was helped by the sound being much better in London... because of course "three piece" is the right answer!</p>
<p>Thankfully the careless neglect of London on this tour will be rectified by a show at XOYO on Easter Sunday - can't wait.</p>
