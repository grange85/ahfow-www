<p>One of the great and greatly missed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Morrison">Sterling Morrison</a>'s final appearances on record was playing on a couple of tracks on Luna's second album <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/wiki/Bewitched_(album)">Bewitched</span>, one of the tracks he appeared on "Great Jones Street" was also recorded for the syndicated radio show Modern Rock Live. This version of the track never got a commercial release but did turn up on a <a href="http://www.toriamosdiscography.info/radiocomps/fmqb.html">1994 Modern Rock Live promo compilation</a>. I believe this version was recorded some time in 1994, Sterling passed away on August 30th 1995.</p>
<p>From a <a href="http://tirbd.com/2008/05/monday-interview-dean-wareham/">2008 interview for Things I'd Rather be Doing</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>tirbd</strong>: <em>Do you have a favorite rock ‘n’ roll and/or tour memoir other than your own?</em><br />
<strong>Dean Wareham</strong>: I really liked Dee Dee Ramone’s memoir, Lobotomy, and Dylan’s Chronicles. And White Bicycles by folk producer Joe Boyd. But my favorite book about a rock star is Great Jones Street by Don DeLillo, which is of course a work of fiction.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The press release for Penthouse was <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.fuzzywuzzy.com/docs/music/penthouse.htm">signed Bucky Wunderlick</span>, the protaganist in Great Jones Street as mentioned in <a href="http://entertainment.salon.com/1996/05/07/luna960506_html/">this 1996 interview for Salon</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Salon</strong>:<em> I noticed that your press release is signed "Bucky Wunderlick." What’s that about?</em><br />
<strong>Dean Wareham</strong>: That was actually a friend who wrote that — Bill Whitten, who plays in the band St. Johnny. Bucky Wunderlick is a character from out of “Great Jones Street” by Don DeLillo. It’s one of my favorite books.</p></blockquote>
<p>"Fuzzy Wuzzy" also came from DeLillo - from a <a href="http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/interview/dean-wareham-of-luna.htm">2004 Stylus interview</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Where did I get “Fuzzy Wuzzy”? I read that phrase in a Don Delillo book. Somebody says, “Can you show me your fuzzy wuzzy” to a woman. Not Fuzzy Wuzzy was a worm.

<p>Bonus:<br />
OK, if you've made it this far - here's a hidden track - as Fuzzy Wuzzy was also DeLillo inspired this is the demo version of that track that was released on the b-side of <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/wiki/Everybody%27s_Talkin%27_(single)">Luna's Sub Pop Singles Club contribution in 1998</span> - this recording was carelessly lifted from my 7" single on my bog-standard non-audiophiles hi-fi system so you get it with the crackles and pops that that entails:</p>
