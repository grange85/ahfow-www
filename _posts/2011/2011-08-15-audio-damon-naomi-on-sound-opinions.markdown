<p>Damon & Naomi were interviewed at length on WBEZ show/podcast <a href="http://www.soundopinions.org/">Sound Opinions</a>. The duo talked at length about their career including discussing the prospects of a Galaxie 500 reunion.</p>
<p>Naomi:</p>
<blockquote><p> "I can't imagine ever doing that... the idea now of playing those songs, and even more of playing them with Dean... it just doesn't seem like it would be a very artistically gratifying experience"</p></blockquote>
<p>Songs performed live were How Do I Say Goodbye, Turn of the Century, Helsinki and A Second Life.</p>
