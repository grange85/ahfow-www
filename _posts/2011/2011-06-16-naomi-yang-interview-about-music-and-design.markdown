<p>There's an <a href="http://imprint.printmag.com/j-c-gabel/the-portable-naomi-yang/">interview with Naomi Yang</a> on the design website <a href="http://imprint.printmag.com/">Imprint</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Of the Galaxie 500 covers, if I had to choose a favorite I think it would be On Fire—I took that photo myself—I made a crazy contraption with my camera so that I could press the shutter and be in the photo and I really wanted it to look like a 60's Elektra records cover (Love, the Stooges, Tim Buckley). It was a moment when Bruce Mau was doing all those beautiful Zone Book covers—the colors of those covers were so amazing, unlike anything I had ever seen before, so I actually called him (I didn't know him) and asked how he did it.</p></blockquote>
