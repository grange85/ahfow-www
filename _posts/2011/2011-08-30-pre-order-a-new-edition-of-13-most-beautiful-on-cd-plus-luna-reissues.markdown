After selling out of the deluxe two disc edition of 13 Most Beautiful Dean & Britta are releasing a new single-disc edition. The disc has been re-sequenced to match the DVD and will come in a new fluorescent pink sleeve. The disc can be <a href="http://deanandbritta.11spot.com/index.php?fuseaction=cart.ecom_cart_view">pre-ordered from Dean & Britta's online store</a> and will be released on October 11, 2001 in a limited run of 1000.</p>
<p>Also Luna's three Jetset releases, The LPs Romantica, Rendezvous and the EP Close Cover Before Striking will be available on iTunes shortly and will include "previously unreleased bonus tracks" - more news on this as soon as I have any! The albums have been unavailable since Jetset went AWOL.</p>
