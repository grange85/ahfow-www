When I started this website in 1994 I didn't really know anything about what I was getting into. All I knew about Galaxie 500, Luna and Damon & Naomi was what I read on the back of the record sleeves, or in the occasional interview that turned up in the print media... and subsequently online.</p>
<p>When someone emailed me and told me that two different versions of I Want Everything had turned up on different pressings of Lunapark, I accepted it as fact and published it on the website - although in the back of mind there was almost certainly some "yeah, right" thinking go on so I never bothered trying to track it down (also this was back when downloading a track from the Internet took days!).</p>
<p>So with this "fact" happily filed away my life of Luna completism happily ticked along unaware that it was actually a <em>fact</em> (without the inverted commas... and in italics!) and that my collection could never be complete... until...</p>
<p>In 2006 Luna released the compilation album, imaginitively titled "Best of Luna" and when my (US Only edition!) arrived I popped it on and approximately 2'30" into I Want Everything I thought my CD player had gone on the blink - that solo was sounding very messed up!</p>
<p>Here's <a href="/2008/02/best-of-luna-sleeve-notes/" title="Best of Luna sleeve notes">Dean's notes from Best of Luna</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There’s a great documentary about the Apollo trips to the moon called for A/I Mankind (with a soundtrack by Brian Eno). They’re up there in space and the astronauts are making little Super 8 movies and talking about their feelings and one of them looks back at Earth and says that he can feel an incredible unseen love emanating from the planet. I made a note of that. Check out Stanley’s cool conga pattern. We mastered this song two different ways. Some copies of Lunapark were pressed with a backward guitar solo here, some have it forward.</p></blockquote>
<p>So here for comparison you can listen side-by-side to both versions of I Want Everything and enjoy them.</p>

<a href="http://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/audio/luna-i-want-everything-backwards.mp3">Luna - I Want Everything - guitar solo backwards</a></p>

<a href="http://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/audio/luna-i-want-everything-forwards.mp3">Luna - I Want Everything - guitar solo forwards</a></p>
<p>So... which was better<br />

Now go buy some Luna - you can get most (probably all now) of their albums on Amazon and iTunes, and their later stuff is on <a href="http://luna.bandcamp.com/">their Bandcamp site</a>.</p>
