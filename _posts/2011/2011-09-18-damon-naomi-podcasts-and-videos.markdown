<p>A couple of recordings Damon & Naomi recorded over the summer have turned up on podcasts recently. The duo recorded three tracks (including a cover of Galaxie 500s Blue Thunder) and interviewed themselves for Arctic Circle radio (on London station Resonance FM) - you can <a href="http://www.jointhecircle.net/radio/?p=1578">download the complete show</a> (that also includes The High Llamas) from the <a href="http://www.jointhecircle.net/radio/?p=1578">show's website</a>. </p>
<p>Also a reminder that <a href="http://www.soundopinions.org/shownotes/2011/081211/shownotes.html">The Sound Opinions podcast #298</a> features another Damon & Naomi session and an interview - that can be downloaded from the podcast website. There's also video of their performance of <a href="http://vimeo.com/27600990">A Second Life</a>.</p>
<p>Also <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/naomiyang">Naomi has set up a Vimeo channel</a> where you can see <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/27844681">the video she made for a track from the new Richard Youngs album</a>.</p>
