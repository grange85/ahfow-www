<p>I've just been pointed towards this lovely interview with Galaxie 500 from a 1990 issue of Ptolemaic Terrascope</p>
<blockquote><p>PT: You're not a very visual group live. You all stand still and look serious.</p>
<p>DW: That's terror. But if you don't feel like jumping, why jump? It's hard to be charming every night.</p>
<p>NY: People used to ask me why don't you smile? Why should I though? There's nothing especially cheerful going on up there!</p>
</blockquote>
