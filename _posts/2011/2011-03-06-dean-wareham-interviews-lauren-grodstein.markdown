<p>Over on the excellent <a href="http://www.largeheartedboy.com/">Largehearted Boy</a> blog you can <a href="http://www.largeheartedboy.com/blog/archive/2011/03/dean_wareham_in.html">read an interview with author Lauren Grodstein carried out by Dean Wareham</a>, across an ocean...</p>
<blockquote><p>DW: You visited us on the road. Were you selling T-shirts for us that night when our dressing room was robbed (quite obviously by the security guards) at that London club?</p>
<p>LG: I was indeed. Before that night went precipitously downhill, a groupie came up to me and asked if I actually knew the band or if I just got to sell their t-shirts. When I said that I knew you guys, her eyes got wide and she asked how I figured out which one to sleep with while we are on the road. I said something like, "It's easy â€“ I pick my husband," and her eyes got even wider. "Wow," she said. "That's so cool." Then she bought a t-shirt.</p></blockquote>
