<p>Dean & Britta arrived on this side of the pond with just drummer Jason Lawrence meaning that they'd be performing the songs of Galaxie 500 in the format of Galaxie 500 - as a three piece. The first show was at The Workman's Club in Dublin on Friday night...</p>

<ul>
<li>Fisherman's Jive Arse Slippers has a short but sweet review saying that they "capture the concentration of the [...] crowd with their Velvet Underground influenced dreamy pop with simplicity and minimalistic pop songs"</li>
<ul></ins></p>
<p>And last night at The Ruby Lounge in Manchester:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folly of Youth has a <a href="http://follyfollyfolly.blogspot.com/2011/02/dean-wareham-plays-galaxie-500-ruby.html">bittersweet review</a> along with some videos (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ1-E6DbTt8&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL">Strange</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYmF0y1phDI&feature=player_embedded">Tugboat</a>), pictures and a <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eF8eqGDuqsw/TVnDRD-vB5I/AAAAAAAADCA/f4DtDAI1-QI/s1600/Dean%2BWareham%2Bplays%2BGalaxie%2B500%2B039.JPG" class="flower_imagebox">snap of the setlist</a>.</li>
