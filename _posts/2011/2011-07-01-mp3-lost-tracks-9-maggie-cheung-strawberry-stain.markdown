For the 2004 film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_%282004_film%29">Clean</a>, Dean Wareham teamed up with lead actor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Cheung">Maggie Cheung</a> to record a couple of songs for the <span class="removed_link" title="http://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/wiki/Clean">soundtrack</span>. </p>
<blockquote><p>the 2 songs I wrote and recorded with Maggie Cheung are now out on the soundtrack album for the film Clean, available on the French label Naive. The songs are "Strawberry Stain" and "Wait For Me". Maggie sings, I play the instruments, except for the bass, which is played by Britta. Maggie has a cool voice, she sounds a little like Marlene Dietrich. Just a little. </p></blockquote>
<p>The soundtrack album also contains the Dean & Britta track Knives from Bavaria<br />
Wait for Me was re-recorded by Dean & Britta for their 2007 album Back Numbers. The other track was this one - Strawberry Stain - </p>

<p>I guess it's not technically "lost" as the album can still be bought - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009KIYD6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B0009KIYD6">Buy the Clean soundtrack on Amazon.com</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=B0009KIYD6&camp=217145&creative=399369" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>
