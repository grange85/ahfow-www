<p>Dean & Britta have a limited edition 7" single which is selling on their current tour down-under. The single is split with tour-mates Sand Pebbles and features a previously unreleased Sonic Boom mix of I'll Keep It With Mine. The single is limited to 300 copies and will be available on the tour dates (and hopefully elsewhere after the tour!)</p>
