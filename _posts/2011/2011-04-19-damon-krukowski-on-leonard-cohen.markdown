<p>Damon has written <a href="http://www.adequacy.net/2011/04/artists-on-albums-aoa20-damon-krukowski-on-various-positions/">a piece on Leonard Cohen's Various Positions</a> for the excellent <a href="http://www.adequacy.net">Delusion of Adequacy</a>'s Artists-on-Albums series.</p>
<blockquote><p>The production is hair-raisingly mid-‘80s, with live drums mic’d to sound like a drum machine, and synthesizer parts that sound like presets being put through their paces at a Guitar Center. The arrangements and mix only really sound good on my equally dated car stereo. And yet lately I can’t stop listening to this record.</p></blockquote>
