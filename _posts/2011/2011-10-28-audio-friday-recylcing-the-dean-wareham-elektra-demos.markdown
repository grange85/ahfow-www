<p>Going through my hard drives last night I seem to have misplaced a folder of "Dean Wareham" recordings (including the phone message Dean left me from Brussels in 1997!) - also missing were some of the recordings Dean made with Jimmy Chambers and Hamish Kilgour after getting a demo deal with Elektra shortly after Galaxie 500 split. A few of these recordings <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/wiki/Anesthesia_(single)">made their way onto a single</span> (and subsequently onto the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RTP4CW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B001RTP4CW">Speed Dating</a> compilation that No.6 Records released a year or two back).</p>
<p>But the rest remain unreleased (and now missing from my hard drive) - luckily for all of us I had already put a couple of them on this site so...</p>
<p>To introduce them here's an extract from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005B1I9Y2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=aheadfullofwi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B005B1I9Y2">Black Postcards</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Terry [Tolkin] got me $3000 to record demos for Elektra. I booked time at Wharton Tiers's Fun City studio on East Twenty-second Street. Jimmy Chambers of Mercury Rev came into town to play the drums on most of the tracks, with Hamish Kilgour of the Clean doing a few of them, too. I played guitars and bass and keyboards myself. Seven songs in total, which I delivered to Terry at Elektra, Peter Shershin at Columbia, and Geoff Travis.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Terry and <a href="http://northforksound.blogspot.com/">Howard [Thompson]</a> liked my demos. The three of us went to lunch at Victor's Cafe on West Fifty-second Street.</p>
<p>"What do you want to do, Dean?"</p>
<p>"I want to make records."</p>
<p>"When I asked Adam Ant that question, he said, 'I want to be a household name.'"</p></blockquote>
