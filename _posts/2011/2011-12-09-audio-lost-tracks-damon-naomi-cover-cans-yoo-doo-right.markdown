Fairly certain this isn't available to buy anywhere. In 1999 Damon & Naomi <a href="/database/release/its-all-over-now-baby-blue-yoo-doo-right/">released a 7" single on indie Grimsey Records</a> (run by Andrea who had been the A&R at Ryko who had coordinated the Galaxie 500 reissues) - the single featured covers of Bob Dylan's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOifMqYXta4">It's All Over Now Baby Blue</a> and Can's Yoo Doo Right - both performed live with Masaki Batoh (of Ghost) and Michio Kurihara at TT the Bears Cambridge, Massachusetts April 9, 1998.</p>

<p>Next month Damon & Naomi's <a href="/database/release/with-ghost/">fantastic fourth album "With Ghost"</a> gets a long overdue re-release by Drag City, as well as the usual digital and CD releases there is also a vinyl release that comes with a bonus 7" featuring covers of The Velvet Underground's Femme Fatale recorded at the With Ghost sessions, and a live cover of Tomokawa Kazukiâ€™s song "My Flower".</p>
