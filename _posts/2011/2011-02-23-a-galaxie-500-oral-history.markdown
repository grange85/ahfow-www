<p><a href="http://vol1brooklyn.com/2011/02/23/conversation-mike-mcgonigal/">This interview</a> with <a href="http://www.yetipublishing.com/">Yeti</a> editor Mike McGonigal suggests that the <a href=" http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7792-temperatures-rising-galaxie-500/">Galaxie 500 oral history</a> that he compiled and was published on Pitchfork last year,  is to get released as a book (and hopefully expanded/enhanced)</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>You recently mentioned that youâ€™re working on an oral history of Galaxie 500</strong><br />
The Galaxie book will be the first in a series of small oral histories of various scenes and groups that YETI will publish.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe he'll find a British critic/journalist or two to interview... More info as and when I get any...</p>
