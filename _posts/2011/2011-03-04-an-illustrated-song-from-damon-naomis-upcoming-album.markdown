<blockquote><p>"This song is about the way time can compress when you are lost in a memory, something I have learned a lot about from Chris Marker’s work – his films (La Jetée, Sans Soleil), his writing (Immemory), his photographs. </p></blockquote>
<p>A 7" single from the album, Walking Backwards, will be released in April on <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.greatpopsupplement.com/start.html">Great Pop Supplement</span>. </p>
