<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/20603766">Damon &amp; Naomi with Chris Marker - And You Are There</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/thewiremagazine">The Wire Magazine</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>


<blockquote><p>"This song is about the way time can compress when you are lost in a memory, something I have learned a lot about from Chris Marker’s work – his films (La Jetée, Sans Soleil), his writing (Immemory), his photographs. </p></blockquote>
<p>A 7" single from the album, Walking Backwards, will be released in April on Great Pop Supplement. </p>
