<p>OK, I'll admit that I've blogged about this before but it doesn't hurt to give this gem another airing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrbeany/2771122779/" title="Ride into the sun by Fozzman, on Flickr"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3035/2771122779_156e8b407d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Ride into the sun"></a></p>
<p>To save myself the bother of thinking of things to say I'll just cut and paste what I said last time...</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1996 Luna supported Lou Reed on the North American leg of his “Set The Twilight Reeling” world tour – this months track is from a performance at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston on (I believe) the 30 March and features Lou Reed joining Luna for a rather wonderful rendition of the Velvet Underground track “Ride Into The Sun”. The track was played as part of Lou’s set (so I guess technically this is Luna joining Lou). Lou and Dean share the vocals.</p></blockquote>
