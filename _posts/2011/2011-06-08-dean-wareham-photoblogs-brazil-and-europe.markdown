<p>Dean Wareham has just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110608+/http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=1190">blogged about Dean & Britta's recent excursions to Brazil and Europe</a> - the blog is accompanied by a stack of pictures and a reappraisal of Nantes from "rainy and ugly" in 1999 to "a jewel" in 2011.<br />
