UK indie label <a href="http://rocketgirl.co.uk/label/release/rgirl76">Rocket Girl have released a limited edition 7" single</a> which features Füxa covering Our Lips Are Sealed on the a-side (with a vocal by Sarah Peacock of the lovely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seefeel">Seefeel</a>) and on the flip is a Füxa remix of Dean & Britta's Crystal Blue R.I.P. from Back Numbers.</p>
<p>The single is limited to 500 copies and comes in lovely blue vinyl.</p>
<p>You can buy it for <a href="http://rocketgirl.co.uk/label/release/rgirl76">£4.50 from Rocket Girl website</a>, and possibly your local indie emporium.</p>
