Last time out I managed to write a [lengthy post that mostly wasn't about this single](/2025/05/19/my-record-collection-luna-cheval-sombre-lonesome-cowboy-bill-7/) so, as promised I'll try and make amends...

Back in early 2016 Dean Wareham and Chris Porpora (aka Cheval Sombre) went into Palmetto Studios to record their wonderful (but sadly now a little lost) album of "cowboy songs" [Dean Wareham vs Cheval Sombre]() and at some point during these sessions Luna recorded a cover of The Velvet Underground's "Lonesome Cowboy Bill" that was released on this 7" single with a cover by Cheval Sombre on the other side.

But... these weren't Luna sessions!? The session was to record for a Dean and Cheval Sombre album, and, ironically Cheval Sombre's version _wasn't_ recorded during these sessions!?

So, were Sean and Lee just passing through? \<shrug\>

Dean shared the track on his newsletter a year after the single came out so... I guess I can share it too:

In December 2018 Dean and Britta and Cheval Sombre played three shows in support of the _Dean vs Cheval Sombre_ release and the New York show as Le Poisson Rouge was recorded and in 2022 a few recordings from the show were released on D&B's Patreon,,, including this lovely take on Lonesome Cowboy Bill:

Mike was at the show and shared this clip on them performing the song:

There are also a stack of [beautiful pictures from that show by Ellen Qbertplaya](https://weallwantsomeone.org/2018/12/15/dean-wareham-vs-cheval-sombre-at-le-poisson-rouge-december-7-2018/).

So... a post about a Luna song with very little Luna content - so, I better fix that. Here's Robert's lovely clip of Luna playing the song in Bristol in 2018:
