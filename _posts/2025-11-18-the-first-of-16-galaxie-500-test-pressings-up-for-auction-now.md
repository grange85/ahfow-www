A test pressing of Galaxie 500's debut album is now being auctioned. The test pressing is the first of sixteen test pressings that will be made available via auction and all will come in unique one-of-a-kind sleeves hand-made and signed by Naomi Yang.

The test pressing is from the first issue of the LP on Aurora records in 1988.

[The auction runs for seven days and has a starting price of $300](https://ebay.us/m/1kdPmz).

<blockquote>
<p>This is number 01 of 16 Galaxie 500 test pressings, each in a unique sleeve designed by Naomi as a series in 2025. The sleeves feature images from Naomi’s archive of sketches and mechanicals used to create the commercial cover art for each corresponding Galaxie 500 release. In the same way that a test pressing is needed to make a final LP, these sketches and mechanicals were used to create the final artwork for the original release. </p>

<p>The image created for each album's test pressing has been mounted on an piece of original Pantone color paper from the late 80’s, also from Naomi’s archive, then stamped and hand labeled and signed by Naomi in 2025. Pantone color papers were crucial to the pre-digital design work that Naomi employed on all the original Galaxie 500 releases. Each test pressing in the series uses a different Pantone color - each number in the series is unique.</p>
