Luna's second album Bewitched is getting a [vinyl repress courtesy of Gotta Groove Records](https://www.gottagroovestore.com/product/luna-bewitched-ggr-exclusive/) - head over to their web site to grab yourself a copy.

The album was originally released only on CD but in 2012 Gotta Groove Records released it on vinyl for the first time - and in the originally planned sleeve that had been replaced at the last minute by Elektra. The 2012 release was limited to 1500 copies so it is long overdue a repress.
