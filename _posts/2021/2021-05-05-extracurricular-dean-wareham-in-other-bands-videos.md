I've covered Dean's extracurricular jobs before either [as a musician](/2013/08/16/dean-as-a-guest-of/) or [an actor](/2012/04/13/dean-warehams-extracurricular-activities-2-film-version/) but here's a couple that slipped the net - Dean appearing in other bands videos.

First up the lovely video for The Hong Kong's Tongue Tied which has Dean being Clyde Barrow to Catherine Culpepper's Bonnie Parker (or is he being Warren Beatty to Catherine's Faye Dunaway?)

Next, Dean having a breakdown of sorts in the video for Hospitality's Going Out - and Britta coming to the rescue.
