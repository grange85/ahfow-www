So it's been a year since the current shitshow kicked in good and proper and I have hardly been on a train since then. We had one trip to the North East in the brief period of relaxed restrictions in late Spetember but otherwise my primary mode of transport for a year has been my feet... and I LOVE being on trains - and over the years I've loved having my train journeys soundtracked by Galaxie 500.

Over tha past four years in my regular searches of YouTube for Galaxie 500 stuff - in amongst all the videos of cars being stripped down or rebuilt - have been [Walter Carlton's lovely videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLerEgcadeay-brYIMRkRVPgeJR_g9Qr5H). They have been shot through the windows of trains all around the world and have been soundtracked with Galaxie 500's. I've loved them but somehow coming across one this week after a year of almost no train travel made them seem more beautiful than ever.
