Not too sure how this has slipped through the _lost tracks_ net but it seems it has. Early Morning's only appearance was as the b-side of Luna's cover of In The Flesh when it was released on Trade2 records back in 1997.

It's another of those relentlessly trippy instrumental that the band seemed to be able to trot out at will (cf. The Enabler, Seven Eleven, Bob le Flambeur and more recently most of A Place of Greater Safety)

Apologies for the crackly vinyl rip - I can't remember when I did this and since my vinyl is all packed up ready for the move it's the best you'll get (unless someone has a better copy and shares it with me).
