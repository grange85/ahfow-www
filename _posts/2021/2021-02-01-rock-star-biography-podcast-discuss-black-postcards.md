The latest episode of the [The Rock Star Biography Podcast](https://www.rockstarbiographypodcast.com/podcast/episode/4996ea40/dean-wareham-black-postcards-a-memoir-or-season-2-ep-4) has a lengthy discussion of Dean Wareham's 2008 memoir Black Postcards.

>  Join Christian and Martha as they explore Dean's Black Postcards, wherein Dean narrates the tragic demise of the former group, the mild success of the latter, and how falling in love with one's new bassist doesn't strengthen marital vows.  LISTENER DISCRETION ADVISED: listening to this episode may cause Galaxie 500 memorabilia to cover your walls, and it isn't cheap.
