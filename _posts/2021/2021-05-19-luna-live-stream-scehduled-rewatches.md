I thought it might be fun to sit down _together_ and re-watch [Luna's live streamed concert](/2021/05/17/a-beautiful-view-luna-live-stream/) before it slips off Veeps and into the ether on Sunday night so... I've scheduled two _events_ where we can all hit *play* together and watch and banter (it looks like the Veeps chat still works) ... or just watch.

You need to [have already bought a ticket for the show](https://luna.veeps.com/) - you can probably still do that - and you can rewatch any time you like up until Sunday night.
