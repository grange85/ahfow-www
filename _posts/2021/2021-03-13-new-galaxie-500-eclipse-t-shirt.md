Damon & Naomi's [online store](https://www.20-20-20.com/store) has a new _topaz_ T-shirt with the Galaxie 500 Eclipse design and it looks rather lovely - _topaz_ it seems is blue (although Googling _what colour is topaz_ just made things more confusing) - luckily Naomi posted a pic on her Instagram to help me out:

[Head on over there to grab one for $20.00](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/galaxie-500-t-shirt-ymdl9-47fy9-9jdyg).

Now... I wear my band T-shirts mostly in black, and occasionally in white - but I make exceptions for Galaxie 500 ones - although I resisted until Naomi encouraged me to try an orange one ... and then an _antique gold_ one (which I've become very attached to)...
