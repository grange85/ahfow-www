Twenty years ago Damon & Naomi with Michio Kurihara played a splendid show at The Garage in London - you can [download the full show here](/database/damon-and-naomi/shows/2001/2001-05-15-damon-naomi-garage-london-uk/)

Here are a few memories from that show.

<!--more-->

- First band was The Clientele - this was probably only the second time I'd seen them live and was still struggling to love them as much as I eventually did. I've possibly seen them since more than any other band.
- Second act was the Trembling Blue Stars who were great - in the review I posted to the Galaxie 500 Mailing List after the show I said... "They have a drummer now gives them the opportunity to occasionally wig out" - I had seen them a few times before... apparently without a drummer - although probably not since the late 90s. I saw them headlining the Garage later that year - but I'm not sure I saw them again.
- I think this was the first UK tour Damon & Naomi did with Kurihara and they seemed to really enjoy having him there.
- Naomi made a [video tour diary](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/damon-naomi-1001-nights-dvd) of this tour so the attached pics are photos snapped off the telly
- This was also the tour that spawned the Live in San Sebastian fake live album.
- I called my _bootleg_ Attention Shoppers as that's what Damon says at the beginning trying to attract the attention of the _shoppers_ at the bar. The picture on the cover was taken in Utrecht a couple of weeks later.
- Naomi had by this time upgraded from a sruti to a harmonium, and was still bringing _that bass_ on tour.
- I dragged my pal Andy along to the show to record it so...
