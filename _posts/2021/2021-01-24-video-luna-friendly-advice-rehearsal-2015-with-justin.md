On Luna's 2015 tour of New Zealand former bassist joined the band for a couple of dates - here's a nice video of the band rehearsing Friendly Advice ahead of these dates (and a short clip of them playing live in Wellington).

This video was shared as part of Luna's Pledgemusic campaign but I'm thinking that enough time has passed (to the point that Pledgemusic has since gone bust) that hopefully no one will mind me popping it online!
