Thirty years ago Galaxie 500 were in the final stages of their last ever tour trekking around North America playing big halls opening for The Cocteau Twins.

On this day in 1991 the band played at the Paramount Theater in Denver and here's an audio recording of the full show.

Actually I'm not too sure how (or when) this recording arrived in my collection but it's well worth a listen - for a band that was cracking apart, on stage they were still darned tight and the crowd seem appreciative of them even though most were there for The Cocteau Twins.
