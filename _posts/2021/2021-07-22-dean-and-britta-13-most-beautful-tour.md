This autumn Dean & Britta will be heading out on a 13th anniversary tour of their 13 Most Beautiful show. The only date so far announced is as part of the Warhol Museum's Sound Series Block Party on the 18th September in Pittsburgh.

The trailer also teases that there will be _A special encore featuring additional screen tests_

If you were unsure about heading to Pittsburgh for the Block Party show perhaps the added incentive of it being followed by Dean Wareham playing Galaxie 500's On Fire as a follow up (and to bring the day to a close). I'd certainly be there if I could!

Tickets are $35 and [on sale now](https://www.warhol.org/events/sound-series-block-party/) from the Warhol Museum.

As soon as I hear about additional dates I'll let you know - and I'll see you in the UK if (when!!) it makes it over here!
