Back in 2003 Dan got in touch with me out of the blue and sent me this poster promoting what turned out to be Galaxie 500's final show at Bowdoin College 30 years ago today. He also sent me some photos he took - all of which has been shared before ... but - now it's being shared as an [artefact](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/category/artefacts/).

My post from earlier today has more on [Galaxie 500's sad and bitter end](/2021/04/05/the-end-of-galaxie-500-30-years-on/).
