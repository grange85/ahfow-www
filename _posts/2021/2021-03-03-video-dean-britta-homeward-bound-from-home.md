I hope Dean & Britta don't mind me raiding their live streams for some gems - but it made me sad that this only existed online for such a short time and that some fans never got to see them doing this lovely cover of Simon & Garfunkel's Homeward Bound to wrap up their early evening show back in Spetember.

... and from earlier in their set another cover - and one of my faves - Adam Green's We're Not Supposed To Be Lovers

Nice also that we got to see Roger during this set.
