Dean Wareham has just released a new track from his forthcoming album _I Have Nothing to Say to The Mayor of L.A._

The track _Cashing In_ is accompanied by a video by L.A. based experimental filmmaker Leanna Kaiser:

You can also listen to the track in all the usual places.

The new album will be released on 15th October and can be pre-ordered from Dean's online shop in an exclusive _cherry_ coloured vinyl.

> Featuring Britta on bass and synth, Roger Brogan on drums, and yours truly on guitar and also playing my new "Hooky" 6-string bass in the coda, Peter Hook's signature model now made by Eastwood guitars. If you watch video of old New Order gigs you realize that so many of the memorable guitar lines were in fact played by Peter Hook on this instrument.
