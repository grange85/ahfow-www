Back in July 2010, while they were touring their 13 Most Beautiful show, Dean & Britta popped into WNYC's Green Space for an interview and to play a couple of songs.

I grabbed this at the time but it's pretty low-res - but... maybe just because it was 11 years ago!

They open with Dylan's I'll Keep It With Mine with Nico looking icy cool. 

After a short interview they then perform Cheval Sombre's I Found It Not So which was supposed to soundtrack Mary Woronov's screen test but someone pushed the wrong number on the DVD and it ended up soundtracking Baby Jane Holzer's toothbrushing. Quite sweet watching Dean's mildly annoyed eye-rolling.
