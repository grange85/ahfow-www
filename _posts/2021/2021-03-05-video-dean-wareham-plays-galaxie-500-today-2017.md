Found myself watching this again last night and it's a treat. A fantastic multi-camera video of Dean Wareham playing Today at The Chapel in San Francsico back in July 2017 from the excellent [3.Cameras.and.a.Microphone YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8tAnV9M2FKiJF2pDbXU0hw/about)

Here's the description as lifted from YouTube...

> What a day this was. I got to the venue SUPER early and peeked through the front window and was surprised to see Dean setting up merch. I squeeze through the locked gate and get into the venue lobby- Dean was super nice. I was thrilled when they gave permission to shoot this video.  
> [...] Anyway, the video turned out great. Filmed with a Canon HFG30 with Rode video pro stereo mic, a Canon HFG10 at the back of the venue, and a gopro hero4 on the side of the stage. Thanks to Sam Habash for the edit(his first edit ever!) and to Alex Kim for watching the back angle.
