A while ago AHFoW was sort of featured in a book, Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll by David Jennings - the world has moved on a lot since 2007 but David's book is still an insightful and interesting read and a snapshot of the world trying to come to terms with music in the digital age - something that it is still struggling with 14 years on!

I've [told this story before](/2007/09/02/net-blogs-and-rock-n-roll/) but this time I'm telling it with a PDF - not of the whole book - just the chapter that involves me - you can probably [find the book for peanuts if you want a copy](https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=jennings%20david&tn=net%20blogs%20rock%20roll&cm_sp=click-_-plp-_-tbc) (or look around here).

Anyway -- here's what I wrote last time...

<blockquote class="blockquote pl-3"><p>The author of the book, David Jennings , has been a member of the Galaxie 500 mailing list for a number of years, and being one of the few list members from London is one of the select members I've met in person more than once. About a year ago David mentioned that he was writing a book and asked if he could interview me for it, I obviously answered "yes" although I wasn't entirely sure just what I had to offer.</p>
<p>We met in the Crown and Sceptre in Shepherds Bush, had a couple of drinks and just chatted. It never seemed like an "interview" more of a chat with someone I felt comfortable chatting with. I cycled home afterwards trying to figure out how anything I'd said could be considered of interest to anyone. A few weeks later David had written the interview into a chapter of a book and sent the chapter to me to check the facts. Chapter 3 is my chapter which discusses fan communities and uses The Galaxie 500 mailing list and A Head Full of Wishes as its example.</p> 
<p>David has <a href="https://www.netblogsrocknroll.com/2007/08/fan-communities.html">written up that interview</a> more fully on his blog.</p>
</blockquote>

So here then is _my chapter_
