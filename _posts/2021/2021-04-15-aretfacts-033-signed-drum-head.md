Luna reunited in 2015 after a ten year hiatus and I got to see them live when they played in Porto on the 24th April. That afternoon I managed to wangle us in to see the soundcheck at the amazing Casa da Musica - and, once Britta had managed to come out and get us in, Hazel and I hung around the hall during the soundcheck. Lee, spotted me and rushed off to the dressing room to recover this fantastic gift.

Lee's drum head signed by all of Luna. It has lived on a shelf in the study ever since - Hazel doesn't think it's beautiful enough to warrant more prominent wall space!?

I guess this is artefact #033a - a signed drumstick from Luna's show at Dingwalls in 2002!
