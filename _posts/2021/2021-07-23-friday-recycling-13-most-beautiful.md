In the wake of the announcement that Dean & Britta will be [heading out on a 13th anniversary tour of their 13 Most Beautiful show](/2021/07/22/dean-and-britta-13-most-beautful-tour/) here's a bunch of 13MB bits and pieces to keep you occupied while you wait for it to arrive near you!

Very cool video of Dean & Britta playing Teenage Lightning at The Warhol in 2012:

A cool set of pictures from their show in Milan in 2009:

When the audio of 13 Most Beuatiful was released a couple of the DVD mixes never got released - Britta sent them over to me to share, so...

Bomb Magazine had a [lengthy article by Dean](http://web.archive.org/web/20090728003841/http://www.bombsite.com/issues/0/articles/3326) about the screen tests and how the show came about...

> I visited the museum in Pittsburgh and looked at about 150 of the Screen Tests, without quite knowing what I was looking for. Warhol had shot close to 500 of these films. Some were so immediately stunning—Jane Holzer brushing her teeth, Ann Buchanan crying a tear—that I knew I had to include them.

Here's a [PDF of the screening notes](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/07-dean_and_britta/pictures/13MB-barbican-prog.pdf) from when they performed it at The Barbican in London.

... and here's [set of pictures of the UK premiere at The Carnegie Hall](https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/sets/72157621177391926/) in Dunfemline.

... and, in case you missed it, here are Dean & Britta intorducing the anniversary tour...
