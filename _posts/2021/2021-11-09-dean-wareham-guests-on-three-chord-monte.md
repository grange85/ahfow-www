On Monday afternoon Dean Wareham was a guest on WFMU's Three Chord Monte. The show featured a nice playlist of Dean, Dean & Britta and Luna tracks and an interview with Dean over the phone from Austin ahead of the short Luna tour that was about to kick off.

You can [listen to the whole show](https://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/109513) and he confirmed that he was going to be playing a couple of tracks from his solo album with Luna including Corridors of Power that got it's debut at a Luna live stream earlier in the year.
