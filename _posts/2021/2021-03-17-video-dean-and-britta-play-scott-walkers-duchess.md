While I loved hearing Dean & Britta [playing Homeward Bound](/2021/03/03/video-dean-britta-homeward-bound-from-home/) what I loved more was them doing this fab cover of Scott Walker's Duchess - maybe because I love the song a tiny bit more than the Simon & Garfunkel one ... (and that just reinforces what a great ear they have for a cover!
{: .lead}

They played the song during both their early and late livestreams in September - this is from the evening performance. In the earlier one Dean explained how Luna's Slow Song was "not accidentally"[[1]](#footnote-1) similar to Duchess.

... again - I hope Dean & Britta don't me sharing this - but it's just too good not to!

Also - if you have a yen for Dean & Britta rarities don't forget to head over and [support their Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/deanandbritta/) where they'll be sharing lots of gems that I can't, the latest of which is a bit of Galaxie 500 ephemera - the sort of thing I'll never get tired of!

[1] I can't remember the exact words Dean used and Hazel's hogging the office on a Zoom call so you'll have to make do with my pseudo-quote!
