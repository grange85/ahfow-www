> Between 1964 and 1966 Warhol shot approximately 500 rolls of film of which mostly were portraits of acquaintances, friends and celebrities visiting his iconic studio The Factory. Shot with a stationary Bolex 16mm camera the subjects were asked to simply sit in front of the camera for a 3-minute timeframe. The subject and camera remained almost motionless creating a seemingly ‘living portrait’.
>  
> In 2010 American musicians Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips were commissioned by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust to compose music to accompany 13 selected films from the series.
