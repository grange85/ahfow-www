Between February and December 2019 the ever wonderful [Sonic Cathedral released 11 7" singles](https://www.soniccathedral.co.uk/singlesclub/) as by a range of fantastic artists. People who subscribed to the whole set received an extra bit of artwork and a special _something_ with each release.

May's release was Luna's cover of Thunderclap Newman's {% ahfowtrack "Something In The Air" %} backed with the beautiful {% ahfowtrack "The Oort Cloud" %}/{% ahfowtrack "Kuiper Belt" %} and the bonus _something_ was a beautiful 'mission' patch modelled after the patches NASA astronauts had stiched to their suits.
