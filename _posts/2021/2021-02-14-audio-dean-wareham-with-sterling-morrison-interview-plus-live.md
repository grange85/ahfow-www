On Valentine's Day in 1994 while promoting Bewitched, Dean Wareham and Sterling Morrison popped into the Modern Rock Live studio in NYC to be interviewed and perform a live version of Great Jones Street. I've shared the live performance before but this includes the interview with Dean & Sterling, and a phone-in segment.
