So... another Bandcamp Friday and another opportunity to throw a few extra pennies into your favourite bands' purses!

Last year I threw together [this page](/articles/bandcamp-releases/) collecting together as many AHFoW related releases I could finc on Bandcamp so this is just me pulling out a couple of highlights:

<!--more-->

Top of the list today should be the new Damon & Naomi album [A Sky Record](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/a-sky-record) which has been released today - it comes as a gorgeous looking 48 page booklet and/or download. The album was once again recorded with long-time collaborator and guitar wizard Michio Kurihara and is as beautiful as you'd expect.

If, like me, you've been missing watching Dean & Britta on their sofa since their Xmas show - and yearn to hear some of their sweet Echo Park living room performances remember you can always enjoy their [Quarantine Tapes](https://deanandbritta.bandcamp.com/album/quarantine-tapes) - and if you need to accompany it with the joy of watching them struggle to turn of at the end of the stream... I can help there...

... and... 

The last few copies of the tribute albums [On Fire 30](https://aheadfullofwishes.bandcamp.com/album/on-fire-30) (_booklet and CD_) and [This Music Is Ours](https://aheadfullofwishes.bandcamp.com/merch/this-music-is-ours-booklet-and-download) (_booklet only_) can be grabbed.
