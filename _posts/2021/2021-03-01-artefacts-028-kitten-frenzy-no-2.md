The fantastic fanzine **Kitten Frenzy** was the work of fab Glasgow band Urusei Yatsura's Graham Kemp. Issue no. 2 was released in Winter 1993 and had a lovely _obituary_ of Galaxie 500 

<!--more-->

> Farewell then old friend. Though you will be sorely missed, yet there is still time to place vinyl under the needle and drink a cup of Ovaltine to the comforting, comfortless sound of Galaxie 500. I love you.

It also had a sweet Galaxie 500 painting by numbers where Damon's hair was the colour _mousy_ and Naomi's shorts were the colour _dinosaur_

I'm not sure how this came into my collection (I certainly didn't buy it at the time) so suspect some kind soul sent me this ~ if it was you thanks, and sorry for not remembering!

I took the opportunity of reprinting (with permission) these in the Everything's Swirling 'zine in 2017.

_I am planning an issue #2 of Everything's Swirling for April - if anyone has any thoughts, art, pictures, cartoons, comics, limericks or words relating to the end of Galaxie 500 please [give me a shout](/about/)_.
