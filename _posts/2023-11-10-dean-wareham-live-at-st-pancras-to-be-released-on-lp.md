Ten years ago Dean Wareham played two exceptional nights at St Pancras Old Church in London, the shows were recorded and released on cassette. Now on the 10th anniversary of those shows the always fabulous [Sonic Cathedral is releasing the show on limited edition vinyl](https://linktr.ee/dwspoc) for the first time.

The album will be released on 15th December and will come in two versions:

 - A Bandcamp exclusive version in gold vinyl
 - A record store version in red/green vinyl

Both editions will be limited to 250 copies of each. The show is spread across three sides of vinyl and has been mixed by Britta Phillips.

This was one of my favourite Dean Wareham shows (of very many over the years) and the recording is splendid and well worth owning!
