This is the first copy of the Luna Live album that I got on CD backstage at the Knitting Factory in NYC in January 2001 - the day before I got the [LP version](/2023/06/01/my-record-collection-039-luna-live-lp/).

As you can see the sleeve is well worn... I like that in a sleeve, things should look like they've been loved. Although the faded spine is a bit of a disappointment!

It's a fab live record, the LP is longer, and therefore better. Here are some thoughts/notes on this one though
 - The Luna Live sleeve is one of my least favourite - here are some reasons:
   - That duotone orange!
   - I'm not fond of the typography.
   - The terrible PhotoShop muddle of five-piece Luna on the front - poor Lee looks awful?! And the way Justin's strap shoots out of Dean's back,

I must admit that I do always find it rather sad when little consideration is given to the artistic canvas that is a record sleeve, thankfully for the most part the sleeves I'm dealing with are invariably well thought out (obv it helps having Naomi's eye on the Galaxie 500 and D&N releases). There are sleeves I don't like but still appreciate for being well thought out - I'm not sure that Luna Live fits that. Sorry, if you were involved, it's just my opinion!

 - The tracklisting is wrong - although technically the tracklisting is right but the CD is wrong!

The tracklisting is wrong because the CD has Double Feature where it was supposed to have Friendly Advice, the band posted [Friendly Advice as an mp3 on FuzzyWuzzy.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010215012152/http://www.fuzzywuzzy.com/lunadocs/themusic/mp3.html)

 - I object to [Four Thousand Days](/database/tracks/four-thousand-days/) being listed as _4000 Days_
 - I object to [Fourth of July](/database/tracks/fourth-of-july/)  being listed as _4th of July_
