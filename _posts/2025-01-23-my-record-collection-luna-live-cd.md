This is the first copy of the Luna Live album that I got on CD backstage at the Knitting Factory in NYC in January 2001 - the day before I got the [LP version](/2023/06/01/my-record-collection-039-luna-live-lp/).

It's a fab live record, the LP is longer, and therefore better. Here are some thoughts/notes on this one though
 - The Luna Live sleeve is awful - here are some reasons:
   - That orange!
   - I'm not fond of the typography.
   - The terrible PhotoShop muddle of five-piece Luna on the front - poor Lee looks awful?!
 - The tracklisting is wrong - although technically the tracklisting is right but the CD is wrong!
 - I object to [Four Thousand Days]() being listed as _4000 Days_
 - I object to [Fourth of July]()  being listed as _4th of July_

The tracklisting is wrong because the CD has Double Feature where it was supposed to have Friendly Advice, the band posted [Friendly Advice as an mp3 on FuzzyWuzzy.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20010215012152/http://www.fuzzywuzzy.com/lunadocs/themusic/mp3.html)
