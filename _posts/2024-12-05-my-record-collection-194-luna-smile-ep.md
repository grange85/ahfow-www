The Smile EP relased in 1993, but given to me by Dean when I visited his apartment in 2001, about which I've talked too much over the years (including already [in this series](/2023/06/01/my-record-collection-039-luna-live-lp/)!. I already owned the CD version which will turn up later.

I have long and often considered Rollercoaster to be one of Luna's lows - although whenever I've expressed that opinion I am invariably shot down by others. I have memories of Dean dissing the track in an interview although I can't find the evidence and wonder if it was my own invention to support my position! Obv, time, as it invariably has a way of doing things, has been kind to it. I [wrote about it](/2012/07/25/audio-lost-tracks-lunas-rollercoaster/) in the [lost tracks](/category/lost-tracks) series.

The _Hey Sister_ demo is one that was recorded at Toxic Shock Studios in Manhattan with Dave Fridmann and was later released on the fabulous [deluxe double LP Lunapark](/2024/08/01/my-record-collection-158-luna-lunapark-deluxe-2xlp/)

The a-side is a couple of Lunapark album tracks, Smile (obv) and Slash Your Tires. According to Dean, when he introduced the song at The Borderline in 1993, the NME said that the song "won a prize for worst guitar solo ever".

The sleeve has a picture of Kim Novak who, in one of those odd coincidences, I'm off to see in [Bell, Book & Candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell,_Book_and_Candle) at The Tyneside Cinema this evening.
