Dean Wareham has been asked, and has answered ten questions over on the [Carpark Records blog](https://www.carparkrecords.com/news/10questionswithdeanwareham/)

<blockquote>
<p><em>What are some of your favorite covers?</em></p>
<p>It's really the singer, not the song; anything that Nina Simone covers is better than the original. I love her versions of "Here Comes the Sun" and "Who Knows Where the Time Goes?"</p>

Dean and Britta reinforced their _singer not the song_ argument by covering [The Singer Not The Song by The Rolling Stones](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/02/22/dean-britta-cover-the-rolling-stones/) recently.

And... as lovely as [Nina's cover of 'Who Knows Where The Time Goes'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlJfrpuhlPI) is, I'd have to disagree that it's better than the [Sandy/Fairport Convention original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeZL2FXkGqI), sorry Dean!
