Neon Lights was recorded during the pandemic in Dean & Britta's home studio and released on Quarantine Tapes... twice, once Britta's original mix and then the Matt Fishbeck/Holy Shit remix that was given the original German title.

This 12" single contains both those versions and two additional remixes by Matt Fishbeck - the first called the _Baxter Street Bounce_ which has a snippet of repeated, sampled, dialogue which I haven't figured out the provenance of, maybe it has none? I assume the "cassette bounces by Philip Haut" credit relates to this remix?

The second new version is called _piano remix_ and is mostly a long, meditative piano piece with Dean's vocal and some treated and layered Dean and Britta voices, there's a little bit of guitar about three minutes in, but then drifts back to the gentle piano and treated voices. It is hypnotic and beautiful.

Dean sent me this in early 2021, the sleeve is signed but also included in the package was an unsigned sleeve... and a hat. I notice that the sleeve has the URL _deanandbritta.net_ which isn't used any more, and was I think brought into existence when [deanandbritta.com](https://www.deanandbritta.com) got hacked.

When I thanked Dean I told him that I got "a nostalgic buzz for a proper 12" single that played at 45rpm" which Dean then described as "the best sounding format"... and this does sound great.
