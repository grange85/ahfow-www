Until fairly recently the only vinyl release of Luna's first album was on Australian indie Summershine, and because of that they would change hands for rediculous prices. So, I had to be content with the CD copy I bought on release.

In May 2014 I turned 50, and had reached 22 years of that _contentment_ - but my family could clearly see the sadness, and loss in my eyes every time I picked out the CD to listen to. I tried to show that it was OK, that I wasn't the sort of person who would be bothered by a twelve inch sized hole in my collection. But I obviously was fooling myself if I thought I was fooling them.

On the morning of my 50th birthday my lovely partner and son filled that gap for me.
