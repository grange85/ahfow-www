Dean Wareham guests on Lys Guillorn's lovely debut album playing guitar on the track _Little Wren_, the album came out in 2003 but had been recorded a while before then.

As well as Dean the album has quite an impressive line-up of guest musicians:

 - Stanley Demeski - drums and percussion - _Luna / The Feelies_
 - Brenda Sauter - bass on three tracks - _The Feelies / Wild Carnation_
 - Robert Quine - guitar on one track - _Lou Reed, The Voidoids ... etc._
 - Glenn Mercer - guitar on one track - _The Feelies_

 The album was produced by filmmaker Jeff Feuerzeig who made the phone calls that got those folk involved:

 <blockquote>
<p>
    Jeff just happened to know these people from being involved with different bands and his documentary project and other work he had done and they were pretty close by--whether in New Jersey or in New York City which isn't far at all from Montclair, the town where the studio was located. It all came together kind of suddenly. It was a vague possibility when we started out, and then those folks said yes and came in as we were wrapping up each song.
</p>

<p>
    Their contributions enhance the songs so much. The solos were definitely beyond the scope of what I would've played had I done them. Mine would've been more predictable. Dean, Quine and Glenn just kicked ass. Brenda and Stanley gave the songs a great backbone, which they had to do after my guitar and vocal parts. Add a spine later.
