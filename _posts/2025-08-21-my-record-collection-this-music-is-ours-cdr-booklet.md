This Music Is Ours was the second (and so far last) tribute album put out by A Head Full of Wishes - this was to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Galaxie 500's third album This Is Our Music five years ago.

My memory's not so good, even though it's only five years since I did this but here's some quick notes on the contributions:

1. Now - Fourth of July  
   Now is the project of Justin Paton with Angela Last and George Chrysostomou. Justin also kindly mastered This Music Is Ours.

2. The Umbrella Puzzles - Hearing Voices
   Ryan from the very fab The Umbrella Puzzles got in touch following my call out for submissions


I quite liked my introduction in the booklet so I'll reproduce it here
