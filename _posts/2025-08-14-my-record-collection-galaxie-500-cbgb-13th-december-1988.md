So my copy of the new Galaxie 500 live album has arrived, under a week after release date (although over a week after some folk were getting theirs). It arrived yesterday while I was out but fortunately the postie left it with a neighbour so I don't have to head off to the sorting office to get it.

This is the "deluxe" copy with the "tip-on sleeve" - I had to Google that:

<blockquote>
An old style record jacket that is hand glued. The term tip-on, refers to the folded seams on the paper. The printing is done on a peice of paper which is then glued to heavy board stock. The effect over standard direct to board jackets, for most record collectors, is similar to the differences between a hardback and paperback book.

More importantly it also came with a live seven inch single...
 - from a different CBGBs show.
 - that had already been [released on a 7" single back in 1990](/2024/10/28/my-record-collection-183-galaxie-500-rain-don-t-let-our-youth-go-to-waste/).

It had also been released on a cassette in 1989, and the sleeve on this release mirrors that of the cassette. I noted in that post on the Caff single that it was the only place you could hear the single sequenced as two tracks - since the releases on CD (and I assume the cassette) sequenced it as one track... so, now there are two places.

My copy is described as having "ultra clear and black 'cloudy' vinyl" - it is actually horrid... and someone might even be tempted to go and buy the UK indies exclusive "milky clear" vinyl just so they didn't need to look at this mess&dagger;:

The album is however fantastic. I've had a bootleg of this show for quite a long time - taken from this source - but this sounds so much clearer, and it is a treat to hear the band so early in their career (this is to my knowledge one of only two shows from 1988 available - the other from [Boston a few days later](/2023/08/17/my-record-collection-061-galaxie-500-unreleased-sessions-and-live-at-the-rat/).

You may have noticed how I'm obsessively mis-naming this album, in titles and in filenames. I'm sorry but I can't bring myself to use the ridiculous date scheme that's been chosen - if you want more details there's a [footnote on an earlier post](/2025/06/10/new-galaxie-500-official-bootleg-up-for-pre-order/) that explains why. I have conceded (although through gritted teeth) and given it the _official_ title [in the discography](/database/galaxie-500/releases/cbgb-12-13-88/).

Thanks so much to Ethan at Silver Current Records for convincing the band to release this, and for doing it in such a nice package (except for the vinyl colour), and I look forward to whatever is found next down the back of the Galaxie 500 sofa!
