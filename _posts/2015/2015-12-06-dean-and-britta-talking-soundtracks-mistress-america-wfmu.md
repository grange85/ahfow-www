<p class="lead">On Tuesday <a href="https://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/63881">Dean &amp; Britta were on WFMU soundtrack show Morricone Island</a> for a lengthy interview about scoring for movies and other aspects of their career, touching on Mistress America, 13 Most Beautiful and even Jem.</p>
<p>The show was an hour long and you can listen to it in all its glory on the Morricone Island web site.</p>
<p>Britta mentions her solo album which is due for release in April of next year, and Dean has mentioned the "cowboy songs" album again... although it's over 18 months since that first got a mention so may still be a way off!</p>
