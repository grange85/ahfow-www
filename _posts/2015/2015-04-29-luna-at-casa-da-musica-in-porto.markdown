Just home from a rather special few days in Porto, the peak of which was of course Luna's show at Porto's Casa da Música - anyone who has followed me on Twitter or <a href="https://instagram.com/p/2BMa2OPDMm/">Instagram</a> on Sunday (and Monday) will know most of this but... for the rest of you here's how the day went.<br />
<figure class="caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/17289421126" title="Casa da Música by Andy Aldridge, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8756/17289421126_a9333f0b15_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Casa da Música"></a><figcaption class="caption-text">Casa da Música</figcaption></figure><br />
17:00 I managed to wangle ourselves an invite to the soundcheck so Hazel and I arrived at Casa da Música to be welcomed by Britta and Augusto who had been arranging the show. Taken inside - the room was rather splendid space in an astonishing building, chatted to Britta, Sean and Lee before Lee rushed off to get me a <a href="https://instagram.com/p/2BMa2OPDMm/">rather brilliant gift</a>!</p>
<p>I fan-posed with Sean and Britta before they joined Lee on stage for the soundcheck and were joined by Dean shortly afterwards.<br />

17:20 The soundcheck had to be over by 6 so that it didn't interfere with the classical concert in the big room next door - the band played a couple of songs and a few snippets.</p>
<p>18:00 The band headed off to rest and eat and Hazel and I headed into the streets around the venue for a bit of sightseeing. While outside I was recognised by Jerónimo and Joana, of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/birdsareindie">Birds are Indie</a>  - who had made <a href="https://soundcloud.com/birdsareindie/23-minutes-in-brussels-luna-cover">this very lovely lo-fi cover of 23 Minutes</a> to celebrate Luna coming to Porto.</p>
<p>19:00 Met up with Luna fans Sara and Ed and headed off to grab a bite to eat - which for vegetarians in Porto is not always that easy - we found a café that obliged us with some omelettes and had a lovely pre-show chat about being fans!</p>
<p>21:00 Doors opened for and we headed into Casa da Musica - found a spot at the front.</p>

21:30 <strong>Luna</strong> - the band have been mixing up their setlists quite a lot on this tour - the set was splendid but was tinged with concerns about what I never got to hear - of course if they'd played everything I wanted to hear the show would have been hours longer! Friendly Advice was a treat, and 23 Minutes was astounding... and the <a href="https://instagram.com/p/19OeT7PDDs/">rest of the set was faultless</a> - Bobby Peru, Pup Tent, Chinatown, Anesthesia, Still at Home etc.<br />

They finished with Bonnie and Clyde... not Indian Summer... I think I missed Indian Summer most - off the top of my head I'm not sure that until Sunday I'd ever seen a Luna show that didn't include Indian Summer.<br />

I'm not complaining - even if sounds a bit like that - it was a treat... and I have London in the summer and they're sure to play another great set - and miss different things out!<br />

23:00 It was all over - hung around with other fans while the band patiently signed tickets and postcards and CD sleeves.</p>
