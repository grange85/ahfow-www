<p class="lead">Another day another Luna reunion tour post...</p>

<p>Matlin on DIMEADOZEN is torrenting Luna's show in Portsmouth NH from earlier in the week. I'm listening now and it's a treat and has the band being very relaxed and particularly chatty - well worth a download. You need to be registered and logged in to get this. It's available in two formats: 16 bit/44.1 khz for the likes of us and 24 bit/48 khz for people with special ears.</p>

<p>Here's a nice video of the band playing Anesthesia in Pittsburgh last night:</p>
