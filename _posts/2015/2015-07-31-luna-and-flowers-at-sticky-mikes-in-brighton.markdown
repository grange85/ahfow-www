<p>Wednesday evening sitting in a holiday cottage in Derbyshire with one full day of our holiday left. </p>
<p>"What shall we do tomorrow?" asks Hazel. </p>
<p>"Well" I reply hesitantly, "we could go home and then I could go and see Luna in Brighton?" </p>
<p>My long-suffering partner rolled her eyes. "How long have you been waiting to suggest that?" </p>
<p>"I've only just thought about it now" I lied.</p>
<p>So, we packed up and on Thursday morning we drove down to London, I dropped of Hazel (she gets to see <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/shows/2015-08-01-luna-brudenell-social-club-leeds-uk.html">Luna in Leeds on Saturday</a>) then picked up a pal and we headed down to Brighton for Luna's first UK show since an <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/shows/2005-01-17-luna-ulu-london-uk.html">amazing night at ULU in January 2005</a>.</p>
<p>We arrived in Brighton after a long, long drive mostly spent crawling around the M25. Grabbed a bite to eat and headed off to Sticky Mike's Frog Bar in time to catch most of the always spellbinding <a href="https://www.facebook.com/flowersdomusic">Flowers</a> beautiful set.</p>
<p>Sticky Mike's is a dingy basement club with a low ceiling and black painted walls - it's what all venues were like in the 80s - oddly shaped and with a low stage which, while making viewing a little tricky it made for a particularly intense atmosphere.</p>
<p>Luna arrived on stage and once the missing setlists were located and positioned at the base of mic stands and drum kit, they played a <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/shows/2015-07-30-luna-sticky-mikes-frog-bar-brighton-uk.html">nicely mixed up set</a>. Every track a gem - the band were relaxed and clearly enjoying playing together. </p>
<p>Bewitched was beautiful, there's something very special about being in a room full of Luna fans because my online life tends to keep them at a distance. But to hear folk around me singing along to Bewitched almost brought me to tears.</p>
<p>The set was nicely mixed up and finished with a storming Friendly Advice followed by 23 Minutes in Brussels. An encore of a couple of covers, Blue Thunder and then Indian Summer, was a perfect ending.</p>
<p>The once (minor) disappointment of their <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/shows/2015-04-26-luna-casa-da-musica-porto-portugal.html">show in Porto</a> in April was that they never played Indian Summer. I know it's a cover but it is also, oddly, most definitely a Luna song. They played it at the first Luna show I saw in 1992, and the last one in 2005 - and, very possibly, at every one in between. When that eBow hum started last night I new that Luna were back.</p>
<p>Show finished - a bit of loitering, then to a bar, and then back to London and in bed by 3am!</p>
<p>The pictures are a little ropey - I'm sure others will have better ones. Keep your eyes peeled on Instagram and Flickr.</p>
