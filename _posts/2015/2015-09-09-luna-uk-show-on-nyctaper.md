<p class="lead">NYCTaper has just put a <a href="http://www.nyctaper.com/2015/09/luna-august-1-2015-leeds-uk-flacmp3streaming/">terrific recording of Luna's splendid show in Leeds</a> up for download.</p>

The show was one of the highs of a week of great shows the band played in the UK during the summer.

You can [download the whole show from NYCTaper](http://www.nyctaper.com/2015/09/luna-august-1-2015-leeds-uk-flacmp3streaming/) in either MP3 or FLAC and you can also stream a couple of tracks if you feel that you need to try before you download!

You can read <a href="/2015/08/17/a-wilder-affair-luna-in-the-uk-part-three-leeds/">Joakim's wonderful account of the show</a>.
You can also read <a href="/2015/08/03/luna-in-london-and-leeds/">my half-arsed review</a> here.


<del>The London show will be uploaded sometime this week so watch this space ([or watch that space](http://www.nyctaper.com))</del>
<p class="lead"><a href="http://www.nyctaper.com/2015/09/luna-july-31-2015-london-uk-flacmp3streaming/">NYCTaper has now also uploaded the wonderful London show</a> from the night before. The show at the Garage was a lot more rock, and a lot louder than the Leeds show - differently brilliant.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.nyctaper.com/2015/09/luna-july-31-2015-london-uk-flacmp3streaming/">download the show from NYCTaper</a>.</p>
<p>Read <a href="/2015/08/14/i-once-met-bob-dylan-on-the-streets-of-paris-luna-in-the-uk-part-two-london/">Joakim's lovely wordy review of the London show</a>, and <a href="/2015/08/03/luna-in-london-and-leeds/">my shorter and more rudimentary take on it</a>.</p>
