Rough Trade have posted a very lovely clip of Damon & Naomi performing The North Light from their recent performance at London's Rough Trade East. Sadly the video has embedding disabled so you'll have to <a href="https://vimeo.com/126922416">head over to Vimeo to see it</a> - it is very well worth the click though.</p>
