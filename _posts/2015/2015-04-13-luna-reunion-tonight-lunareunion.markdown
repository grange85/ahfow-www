<p>This evening in Los Angeles Luna will play their first concert in 10 years. The last line up of the band featuring Dean Wareham, Sean Eden, Lee Wall and Britta Phillips are playing a show at The Echo before heading off for a <a href="/database/damon-and-naomi-shows-2015-luna-shows/">tour of Spain and Portugal</a>.</p>
<p>The band also have <a href="/2015/03/luna-announce-uk-dates-for-the-summer/">shows scheduled in the UK</a> in the summer and will be playing the US in the autumn.</p>
<p>If you're lucky enough to be going along tonight feel free to post tweets, pictures and videos so that we can all enjoy the show by proxy!&nbsp;</p>
