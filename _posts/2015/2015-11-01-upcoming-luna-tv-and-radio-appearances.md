<p class="lead">Luna have a couple of media appearances while the US tour is wrapping up...</p>
{% ahfowimage "http://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/pictures/2015-11-02-luna-carson-daly-tv.jpg" "Luna on Carson Daly" %}
<p class="lead">Firstly on Monday 2 November some excerpts from one of Luna's recent performances in Los Angeles will be broadcast on the <a href="http://www.nbc.com/last-call-with-carson-daly">Last Call with Carson Daly</a> TV show on NBC.</p>

<p>The show airs at 01:35 (so technically it's the early hours of Tuesday morning) - so set your VCRs or whatever your modern equivalent is! The above image, pilfered from Luna's Facebook page has the details.</p>

<p>This could well be Luna's first TV appearance since playing on the John McEnroe show way back when... here's a clip of them playing Speedbumps and then being joined by Superbrat on a cover of Sweet Jane.</p>

<p class="lead">... then on Thursday 5 November the band will be playing a live radio performance for KEXP in Seattle&hellip; and I imagine that will be streaming live video too.</p>

<p>The last time they were at KEXP was I think in 2002 supporting Romantica - <a href="http://kexp-web3.cac.washington.edu/live/liveperformance.aspx?rId=12239">you can hear that show here</a>... if your device can manage the out-dated format!</p>
