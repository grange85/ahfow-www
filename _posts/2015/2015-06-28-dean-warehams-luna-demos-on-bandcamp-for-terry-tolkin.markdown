Dean Wareham has just <a href="https://luna.bandcamp.com/album/luna-demos-1991">released the recordings he made</a> after leaving Galaxie 500 and before he formed Luna. All proceeds from the release are to help pay for the medical bills of Terry Tolkin:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Luna (at this early stage Dean Wareham) was signed to Elektra by A&R man Terry Tolkin who had previously worked at Rough Trade, Touch & Go and Caroline Records. Terry now lives in New Orleans and is gravely ill. He is fighting a rare and aggressive virus that has his doctors perplexed, and facing huge medical bills for hospital visits, thrice-weekly dialysis and prescription drug co-pays.</p></blockquote>
<p>The tracks were recorded at Fun City in NYC in 1991 with the help of Jimmy Chambers of Mercury Rev, and Hamish Kilgore of The Clean. A couple of the tracks previously appeared on Terry's No.6 records.</p>
<p>So for $7 (or more!) you can get a tasty slice of Luna's history and help out Terry with his debilitating medical bills.<br />
