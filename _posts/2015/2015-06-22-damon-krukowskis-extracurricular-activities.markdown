<p>A few bits and pieces to catch up on what Damon has been doing when he's not being part of Damon & Naomi.</p>
<p>Damon's working on a non-fiction book - "The New Analog" which I guess has grown out of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/oped/9304-the-new-analog/">this Pitchfork piece from last year</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In other words, mapping ourselves via headphones or GPS can lead to disorientation. Without analog clues to guide location, the world becomes an Alice-in-Wonderland-like place where signs pointing north nonetheless lead south, and sounds come from the left or right but never straight ahead. </p></blockquote>
<p>He's also <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/oped/9667-drop-the-bass-a-case-against-subwoofers/">written a piece recently for Pitchfork making "the case against subwoofers"</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To my ears, the bass boosting of Beats and of home theater systems designed to mimic reality for movies and games doesn’t translate to a “real” experience of music. But my idea of real is based on the experience of physical instruments, acoustic and electric. And perhaps the reality of music itself has undergone a change. </p></blockquote>
<p>It's definitely worth <a href="https://twitter.com/dada_drummer/">following Damon on Twitter</a> for insightful commentary on all aspects of the music biz... and beyond </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I say let everyone stream free so it doesn&#39;t require massive capital to build alternatives - we have nothing to lose but corporate crumbs</p>
<p>&mdash; Damon K (@dada_drummer) <a href="https://twitter.com/dada_drummer/status/608632684840124416">June 10, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>... and <a href="http://internationalsadhits.tumblr.com/">keeping an eye on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>And for all this and more Damon has <a href="http://www.dadadrummer.com/">a new website - DadaDrummer.com</a>.</p>
