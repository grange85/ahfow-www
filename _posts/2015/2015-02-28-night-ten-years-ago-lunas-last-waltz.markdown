<p>Luna played their last show ten years ago tonight - here's how it ended...</p>

We played "Indian Summer" for the very last time, and I thought, we're playing this for the last tim e. I had always enjoyed listening to Sean's beautiful guitar solo, the way he bent certain notes on his Jazzmaster. Tonight I moved stage left, so I could hear it better.

<p>BUT...</p>
<p><a href="/2014/10/luna-reunion-confirmed-spanish-tour-april-us-dates-follow/">Luna will be back</a>, they're playing a <a href="/2015/02/luna-reunion-date-los-angeles-april/">comeback show in Los Angeles in April</a> (that apparently sold out in about seven minutes!) before heading off for a fortnight in Spain (and one night in Portugal - where you'll find me), and then playing some more3 dates around the US (and hopefully elsewhere) during the summer and autumn.</p>
