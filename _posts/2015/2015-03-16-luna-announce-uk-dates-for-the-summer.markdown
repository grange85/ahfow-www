OK - having got over the excitement of <a href="/2015/03/luna-announce-london-date-for-july/" title="Luna announce London date for July&nbsp;">Luna announcing a show on my doorstep</a>, I feel that the rest of the country deserves to know that Luna have announced a number of dates in the UK during the summer. So far four dates have been announced in London, Leeds, Glasgow and Manchester:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 July 2015 - Luna at The Old Market, Brighton, UK</li>
<li>31 July 2015 - Luna at The Garage, London, UK</li>
<li>1 August 2015 - Luna at the Brudenell Social Club, Leeds, UK</li>
<li>2 August 2015 - Luna at CCA, Glasgow, UK</li>
<li>3 August 2015 - Luna at Gorilla, Manchester, UK</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll add more dates if and when they arrive.</p>
