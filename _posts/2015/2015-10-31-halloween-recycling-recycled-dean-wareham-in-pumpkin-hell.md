<p>The film was made in 2007 by Max Finneran and is...</p>
<blockquote><p>a short coming-of-age horror film about sons, fathers and the roles they play and imagine for one another.  Abandoned by his father at a highway-side pumpkin patch, an eleven year-old boy spends a peculiar and life changing night with the misfit proprietor of the patch. </p></blockquote>
