<p class="lead">The Carpenter Center for Visual Arts in Cambridge MA is hosting an exhibition by Damon Krukowski called <a href="http://ccva.fas.harvard.edu/damon-krukowski-not-be-played">NOT TO BE PLAYED</a> that is described as:</p>

<blockquote>
a multifaceted exhibition featuring archival materials, performance, and a publication that together revive an obscure audio recording made by Ezra Pound at Harvard University in 1939. Recorded on the eve of World War II, Pound believed his poem "Sestina: Altaforte"—or "Bloody Sestina," as it came to be known—could incite violence. He was convinced it possessed a persuasive power over the future: several years after making the recording, Pound wrote a letter stating it was "not to be played."
</blockquote>

The exhibition opens with a reception on Thursday 8 October at 6pm and runs until 25 October.
