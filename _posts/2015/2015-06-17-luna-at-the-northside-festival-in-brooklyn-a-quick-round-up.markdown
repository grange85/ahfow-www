<p>The New York Times has a review of the show:</p>
<blockquote><p>Live, the songs opened up in ways that the studio versions deliberately held back. In music with such a restricted palette, small variations loomed larger: when “Bewitched” began with Mr. Wareham playing alone, when Ms. Phillips’s bass leapt out with a switch to distortion in “Friendly Advice,” when the whole band floated into a psychedelic haze in “Pup Tent,” when crescendos swelled and suddenly dropped away.</p>
<p>At first, Mr. Wareham and Mr. Eden confined their lead guitar parts to terse little hooks; then they improvised more to reveal their distinct touches, jittery and insistent from Mr. Wareham and curvy and long-lined from Mr. Eden. Luna toured Spain and Portugal earlier this year and its members are listening to one another closely, clearly savoring their reunion.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Clearly the band was still in peak form based on the performance, especially when Wareham and Eden traded both tasty lead and rhythm parts, not to mention some humorous, friendly banter like old times</p></blockquote>
