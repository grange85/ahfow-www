Damon has another [opinion piece in the Guardian today](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/28/new-law-how-musicians-make-money-streaming) about streaming payments for musicians, and a bill being introduced in US Congress in an attempt to address the problems.

<blockquote>
That’s a broken system. It’s not just broken for individual artists, it’s broken for our society as a whole. We all benefit from music. And I believe we as a society want that music to come from as wide and deep and rich and varied sources as exist. How could we not?

<blockquote>
The Living Wage for Musicians Act proposes a straightforward mechanism: an additional subscription fee, earmarked for artists, plus a percentage of platforms’ non-subscription revenue to cover ad-supported (free) streaming, is paid into an Artist Compensation Royalty Fund.
