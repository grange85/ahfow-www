Unlike Angel Corpus Christi's [lovely Luna tribute album](/2023/06/12/my-record-collection-042-angel-corpus-christi-bewitched-a-tribute-to-luna/) I don't have to bend the rules to include _therealangelcorpuschristi_ since Dean plays guitar (and Britta bass) on a Velvet Underground cover.

_therealangelcorpuschristi_ is a compilation album pulling splendid contributions from across Angel's remarkable body of work. Dean and Britta turn up on a splendid cover of Femme Fatale:

> We asked Pete (Sonic Boom) Kember to play on Femme Fatale, and he surprised us with a hypnotizing version featuring Dean Wareham on quitar, Britta Phillips on bass, and Pete on various keys. Pete mixed it too and the result went above and beyond our expectations!

The whole album is amazing and worth hunting down - not sure it ever got a digital release but you can find most of it sprinkled around [Angel's Bandcamp](https://angelcorpuschristi.bandcamp.com/) it includes a fab cover of [Dream Baby Dream (with Alan Vega!)](https://angelcorpuschristi.bandcamp.com/track/dream-baby-dream), Angel questioning Lou Reed's hairstyle choices in [Lou Reed's Hair](https://angelcorpuschristi.bandcamp.com/track/lou-reeds-hair) (but ultimatley forgiving him), and a frankly hilarious [Baby Elephant Walk/Walk on The Wild Side mash up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUwcFfZYpFg).
