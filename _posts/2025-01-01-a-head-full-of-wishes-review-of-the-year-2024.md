Surprised to discover that I haven't done a _review of the year_ since the [2018 one](/2019/01/01/review-of-the-year-2018/), probably because I didin't think they were _that_ interesting - but what else will I be doing in the lull between Xmas and New Year... so, here's the AHFoW review of 2024.
{% ahfowimage "https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54231180750_e3b39ef632_c.jpg" "Review of the year - 2024" "https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/54231180750/in/dateposted/" %}
2024 was a quiet year for shows, here are the numbers I have (remembering that some do slip through the net):
 - Luna - six dates, all in the US
 - Damon & Naomi - seven dates, in the US and Japan
 - Dean & Britta (or Dean Wareham) - six dates, in the US and New Zealand (plus a few streamed 'shows' on Instagram)

Quiet for them, but not for me
 - I wrote 158 posts for A Head Full of Wishes, mostly about _my record collection_ but, despite the paucity of shows Dean, Damon and Naomi were still keeping me quite busy!

### January
 - The [my record collection series](/category/my-record-collection/) entered it's second year with Cagney & Lacee's [Six Feet of Chain](/2024/01/04/my-record-collection-098-cagney-lacee-six-feet-of-chain/) - the first of 108 posts during the year!
 - Dean sold a few copies of the Bandbox live Luna albums of Bewitched, Penthouse, and Rendezvous on his web site, if we'd known what was to come we'd have all jumped on that, because...

### February
 - ... on the 23rd of February Bandbox "entered into an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors" - which meant that everyone still waiting seemed very unlikely to get either the albums, or their money back. I'm still waiting... and hoping. Dean posted on Instagram a few weeks back that he had "talked to the company who are handling all the unshipped vinyl, they are making some progress, they say they will set up a way to get the vinyl to people for a shipping fee" - but, I'm not holding my breath.

### March
 - Dean & Britta played at the Bob Dylan Center in Tulsa as part of Wesley Stace's Cabinet of Wonders - no pics or videos ever turned up.
 - Luna played a few dates, in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Chicago...

### April
 - Dean & Britta's first album [L'avventura got a deluxe release as part of Record Store Day](/2024/04/25/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-16-dean-britta-l-avventura-rsd-2024/) - with added _Sonic Souvenirs_.

 - Dean and Britta were in Portugal with Sonic Boom working on what was to become [A Peace of Us](/2024/12/02/my-record-collection-r11-dean-britta-sonic-boom-a-peace-of-us/).
 - I retired after almost eleven years at The National Archives... and on my last day Dean and Britta turned up with a couple of the Bandbox live LPs, and the RSD L'avventura:

 - Since no one had played, or was going to play, any live shows in the UK this year I was thrilled I still got to see them!
 - Damon & Naomi played a few dates with Kath Bloom

### June

### July
 - It was announced that Galaxie 500 were going to release an expanded "Uncollected" - a double LP of their Noise New York sessions.

I buy two vinyl copies!
