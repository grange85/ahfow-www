Here's another selection of videos from Dean Wareham's current tour around the UK (and one from Paris)... 

After [my last post](/2025/04/05/video-dean-wareham-in-the-uk/) Dan kept uploading more clips from the Leamington Spa show, here they are playing Galaxie 500's {% ahfowtrack "Tugboat" %}

{% ahfowvideo "JYJYT9QfyP0" "Tugboat (Leamington Spa)" %}

After Leamington Spa the band headed to Leeds (I'll write more about this at some point). Here the band is soundchecking up {% ahfowtrack "New World Julie" %} - this was taken with my camera sitting on a soft seat so it vibrates annoyingly every time Roger hits the kick drum!

Next, on to The Fleece in Bristol, here playing Galaxie 500's {% ahfowtrack "Snowstorm" %}

{% ahfowvideo "MVj_yEWjAAU" "Snowstorm (Bristol)" %}

... and on to London and {% ahfowtrack "Blue Thunder" %}

You can also watch 30 minutes of _highlights_ from the London show (although surely the show was just one 90 minute highlight?):

... and then across The Channel and onto a boat on The Seine in Paris, here they are playing {% ahfowtrack "Bourgeois Manqué" %} from the new album:

The tour is now heading for a few dates in The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark and then six dates in Spain... so expect more! You can [see a list of upcoming shows here](/database/dean-and-britta/shows/). If anyone's going to the show in Groningen feel free to hunt me down and say "hello".
