This is a DVD of a Luna show from 11th November 1992 that was doing the rounds for a long time - sometimes with the date wrong (it sometimes gets shared as 11th April 1992 because of Americans and their bizarre MM/DD/YYYY dating system - why go medium/small/big, it makes no sense?). I think I got sent this in the early 2000s, but it was also being shared on bittorrent sites not long after that.

The show was at The Coach House in San Juan Capastriano when Luna were supporting The Screaming Trees. John, on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List wasn't at the show but was familiar with the venue:

<blockquote>
Ewww, the Coach House. I used to live down the road from there when I lived
in southern California... one of the worst venues I've ever been to, along
with every other venue in Orange County. Its more like an elk lodge than a venue.
I'd never want to see Luna there... its very depressing.

The video isn't too bad but the sound is a little ropey. In more recent times we have learned the provenance of this show since the original taper, [Shayne Stacey aka 3.Cameras.and.a.Microphone aka @sacramentomusicarchive](https://www.youtube.com/@sacramentomusicarchive), has shared the show in a couple of ways

<blockquote>
This was my first time seeing Luna and I was thrilled. They were opening up for Screaming Trees on this tour. My battery pack died before the end of their set, which was unexpected and a total bummer.. so this is incomplete.

I asked Dean about the show back in 2005 to see if he was OK with it being shared - "My recollection of that show is that it wasn't very good" - looks and sounds pretty good to me.
