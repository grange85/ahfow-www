In 2008 Damon & Naomi reissued their debut album More Sad Hits on LP and CD and this is the CD version and unexpectedly is a nicer package than the LP becasue it was given a rather lovely card gatefold sleeve with a series of Norman Gholson photos inside.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/damon-and-naomi-more-sad-hits-202020-cd.jpg" "Damon & Naomi - More Sad Hits (2008 reissue)" %}

The reissue also came with a new essay by 'Damon & Naomi' which is both interesting and, for a fan. a rather hard read. Because it documents not only the beginning of Damon & Naomi as a recording entity, it obviously also touches on the end of Galaxie 500, and it, more clearly than some other articles and interviews, shows how the wounds of the break up were still very raw almost 20 years on. 

I started to quote some of the essay but it felt like I was poking at those wounds and that's certainly something I shouldn't do.

THe essay also talks about the last song on the album, This Changing World, which in 2008 was still to all of our knowledge, what is described as a Claudine Longet original... [but we know better now](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2014/06/25/originals-changing-world-claudine-longet/)!

The insert that came with the CD also has a (small) pic of the sheet of paper were Damon has worked out Soft Machine's Memories... in one case, incorrectly.

I wrote about both of those covers in a Substack post last month.

You can still [buy copies of the CD from Damon & Naomi for $12](https://www.20-20-20.com/store/p/damon-naomi-more-sad-hits) and it really is a very lovely package. And, of course a very beautiful album.
