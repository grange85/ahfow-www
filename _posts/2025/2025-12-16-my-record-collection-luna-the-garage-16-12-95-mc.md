I'm squeezing an extra record collection post in this week because this one arrived in my randomised list almost exactly 30 years on from the show it is a recording of and it seemed a shame not to take advantage of that, although I did post about it on its 25th anniversary so this is mostly a re-hash of that one (and barely re-hashed at all).

{% ahfowvideo "FiPS9PRIJQ" " Luna - The Garage, London - 16th December 1995" "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/luna-the-garage-16-12-1995-mc.jpg" %}

In 1995 photography was analog and almost nobody took photos at gigs so I've never seen any of this show. People did record gigs though and a couple of weeks after the show someone (can't remember who, maybe Paul? Sorry!) sent me a recording.

A Head Full of Wishes (as a mailing list and web site) had been running for about a year by then but this was the first show where I met internet friends in real life. I'm not a particularly social person but somehow in-the-flesh meetings with A Head Full of Wishes friends sort of pulls me out of that shell - and this was the first time I was pulled!

First up Trenton introduced himself to me in the queue outside the venue - I don't think I handled this as well as I ought but, while I knew people I'd interacted with online where going to be there I didn't really expect any to talk to me. So Trenton caught me off guard!

Next up Lauren, in the venue, who tried to convince me to speak to Dean after the show. I didn't. It was a couple more years and a few more shows before I was brave enough to do that.

I thought I'd first spoken to Paul that night but a diary entry I came across recently suggests that I first met him at a Damon & Naomi show at the 12 Bar.

I think most times I've seen Luna they've finished the night with Indian Summer - here they are finishing that night in that way:
