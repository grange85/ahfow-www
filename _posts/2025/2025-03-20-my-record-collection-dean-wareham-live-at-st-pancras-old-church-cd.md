This is a CD containing six tracks recorded at St. Pancras Old Church in December 2013 - a fuller version of this recording was released firstly [on cassette](/2023/02/23/my-record-collection-011-dean-wareham-live-at-st-pancras-old-church-red-cassette/) in 2014 and then on [1.5xLPs](/2023/12/16/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-04-dean-wareham-live-at-st-pancras-old-church-december-2013/) on the show's 10th anniversary in December 2023.

I mentioned in the post on the lovely [Sonic Cathedral - Celebrate Yourself! release](/2024/12/06/my-record-collection-r12-various-artists-celebrate-yourself/) that when the booklet claimed that the version of "When Will You Come Home" on it was the track's first appearance on CD it wasn't entirely true.  This promo CD that was given away with early copies of Dean's eponymous solo album in March 2014, is the reason why.

The CD contains three Galaxie 500 songs, one Luna one, and two from Dean's most recent solo release (Emancipated Hearts) and comes in a card envelope with the title hand stamped on it.

Read the previous entries in this series for the story of the concerts that made up this release. I thought I'd use a photo that you can see a bit more of the church in this time, although it does mean that Britta is obscured - it seems to be a [theme of mine to have an obscured view of Britta](/2024/11/18/video-dean-britta-and-cheval-sombre-in-london-in-2009/).
