Dean Wareham's online shop has a discount on many items between now and the first of December. There is a 20% discount on all T-shirts including Galaxie 500 and Luna ones, as well as Dean and Dean & Britta ones. There's also a discount on some other items,

[Check it all out here](https://deanwareham.com/shop)

Also the Carpark Records shop is offering 30% off on everything from Friday 28th November until Monday 1st December. 

This I guess will include:
 - Dean's excellent [That's The Price of Loving Me](https://store.carparkrecords.com/products/cak180-dean-wareham-thats-the-price-of-loving-me) (I think both the clear and tan vinyl copies are still available, and CD.
 - Last year's lovely [A Peace of Us](https://store.carparkrecords.com/products/cak177-dean-britta-sonic-boom-a-peace-of-us) which has a new red vinyl release this year.
 - The [A Peace of Us camping mug](https://store.carparkrecords.com/products/dean-britta-and-sonic-boom-holiday-mug).
