As well as posting to this website, since April I have been posting weekly pieces on the A Head Full of Wishes Substack - the intention was just to re-hash some old posts but over time it turned into more than that. They were, of course, of varying quality so I've picked a few of the ones I think were more interesting and am posting them here in case you missed them.

### [From the archive: Luna in London](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/from-the-archive-luna-in-london)  
  _Substack: 6th May 2025_

Some memories of Luna's show at The Borderline in 1995 and of other shows I saw before The Borderline closed

<blockquote>
This was the second time that I saw Luna at The Borderline, a smallish basement club in the West End that I wasn’t always all that fond of - it seemed to suffer with a noisy clientele - or perhaps more accurately a noisy bar - more than some other venues in London.

### [Handwritten set-lists](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/handwritten-set-lists)  
  _Substack: 21st October 2025_

A collection of snaps and scans of hand-written setlists

<blockquote>
A band’s handwritten set-lists seem to have become quite the collectors item of late, so much so that Dean reported that at his Bristol show back in April “a couple of fans fought over a paper set-list” … which is a bit sad. I’ve never really been one to jump onto the stage and grab a set-list although I have acquired a few over time...

### [Damon & Naomi in the UK this week in 1999](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/damon-and-naomi-in-the-uk-this-week)  
  _Substack: 27th August 2025_

Some memories of Damon & Naomi's UK shows when they were over for the London Terrastock in August 1999.

<blockquote>
Bob, famously the Galaxie 500 Mailing Lists oldest member, was in town for Terrastock and we were planning to meet at the show however during that planning it became clear that we were both at a loose end on the night before Terrastock, and that Damon & Naomi were playing that night in Brighton. So… Bob and I made a fairly late decision to drive down to Brighton to catch them.

### [The making of Luna's Dear Paulina single](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/the-making-of-lunas-dear-paulina)  
  _Substack: 23rd September 2025_

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/dear-paulina-memorabilia.jpg" "Dear Paulina memorabilia" %}

<blockquote>
On the 9th of August Hazel and I went to Abbey Road Studios to oversee the cutting of the masters - of course we knew nothing and just went along for the ride with little more than Dom’s advice which was something along the lines of “don’t let them mess with it”, But there we were sitting on a couch in Abbey Road Studios, trying not to look like we knew nothing!

### [Galaxie 500 at The Subterania - 27th June 1990](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/galaxie-500-at-the-subterania-27th)

_Substack: 24th June 2025_

This is less a post about the show and more about the effect that the show had on my life.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/show_assets/1990-06-27/1990-06-27_galaxie_500-ticket.jpg" "Ticket for Galaxie 500 at The Subterania (sadly... not mine)" %}

<blockquote>
<p>The Subterania was a club located underneath the Westway in west London. Most gigs around then were happening in North London or the West End so it was nice having a venue a little closer to home so we saw quite a few gigs there over the years (although I somehow managed to not see Galaxie 500’s first gig there the previous year).</p>
<p>To be honest I can’t really remember the specifics of Galaxie 500’s set, but, main set over, at approx 22:30 Galaxie 500 returned to the stage for an encore, they were joined by Kramer and played Ceremony, followed by Don’t Let Our Youth Go To Waste. I was mesmerised.
