Britta's lovely solo album **Luck or Magic** is getting a re-press courtesy of Vertigo Vinyl - the LP will be in _Fuchsia Starburst_ vinyl and comes in a different sleeve (it seems to have removed the pink border and made Britta's visage fill the full 12 inches, which can't be a bad thing?!

In addition the label will also be releasing a heart-shaped single with an alternative mix of _Drive_ on the a-side and _Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)_ (previously only available on a lathe-cut single) and a Congo Hammer (Roger Brogan) remix of _Ingrid Superstar_.
