This test pressing of Dean's 2021 solo album is another sweet gift from Dean that arrived in a package of goodies at the end August of that year.

I'll maybe talk more about the album when the released LP arrives in this collection. This is however a lovely sounding test pressing in a plain bag with a white label that is signed by Dean on the A side. The bag is stamped `APPROVED JUL 10 2021`.
