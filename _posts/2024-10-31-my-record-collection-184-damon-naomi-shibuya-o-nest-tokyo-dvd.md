This was the second of two limited run DVDs of live shows that Damon & Naomi released, this one was recorded over two nights in Tokyo in January 2008 with Michio Kurihara on guitar, Helena Espvall on cello and Bhob Rainey on sax.

It's a lovely performance shot with a couple of static cameras and has lots of nice long, lingering shots, although not always lingering where you might want it to be, most notably during Kurihara's fabulous guitar freak-out during _This Car..._ which has Naomi in the way at the beginning of it, and that would generally be no hardship, but the freak-out is so unexpected that it seems a shame we don't see the beginning of it. It does later cut to the other camera so we don't miss it all!

There's an eight minute clip of _Stars Never Fade_ from the DVD on YouTube that is pretty special too - with Kurihara and Helena Espvall duelling instruments

I love live albums, a couple of my favourite albums of all time are live ones, and I do like live video clips that turn up on YouTube - but full live concert videos for some reason don't work, perhaps because a live audio recording can take you into the room, but a live video is clearly not where you were, or where you stood? I guess I'm not alone since video still hasn't become a method of music distribution.

Having said that, this is lovely as a record of a show (that I wasn't at). It's very heavy on tracks from Within These Walls - seven of the 12 tracks are from that album, but that's what they were promoting, and Lilac Land and Stars Never Fade are up amongst my favourite Damon & Naomi tracks so, no complaints here.

Damon & Naomi are [back in Tokyo next week](/2024/10/22/damon-naomi-japanese-dates-in-november/) for a couple of dates - and if you're not in Tokyo you can still [enjoy their show on the 5th November online](/2024/10/28/damon-naomi-s-upcoming-tokyo-date-to-be-live-streamed/)!
