Now that John Peel's copy of Today has gone beyond my budget I guess I should point out the Galaxie 500 items that are in the [John Peel Collection sale](https://bid.omegaauctions.co.uk/auction/search?au=205) that is happening (online) next week.

**Lot 193: GALAXIE 500 - TODAY LP (AU 002 - US ORIGINAL PRESSING)**  
This is an original Aurora copy of Galaxie 500's first album. It comes with some promo material and the sleeve has been defaced:

<blockquote>
An original US copy of Galaxie 500 - Today (AU 002, US original pressing). The record is in Ex+ condition with clean labels. Ex sleeve with 'promo not for sale' written in black pen on the front of the cover. Includes handwritten letter to John Peel and promotional inserts.

**Lot 153: ROUGH TRADE - TEST PRESSINGS**  
Galaxie 500's This Is Our Music is bundled with a couple of other Rough Trade LPs (Butthole Surfers and Paul Leary) the auction describes them as "test pressings" but the picture shows the full sleeve with the barcode so I suspect that this is just the regular release, with added promo material.

I'm not sure what's happened to [Peel's copy of On Fire](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/01-galaxie_500/pictures/john-peel-galaxie-500-sleeves/G039-20830-1.jpg).

The auction is 29th July at 10:00 but you can register now and place bids on any items ahead of the auction. Note that you end up paying 28% more than you bid!
