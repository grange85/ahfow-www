Days Go By was Cheval Sombre's second album of 2021, arriving just a couple of months after Time Waits for No One. Maybe because of that I do find it hard not to think of them as one double album, they are different, Days Go By feels a little lighter in tone, but they are still clearly related.

The relationship to Time Waits for No One is clear, and it's more than just the timing - the sleeve artwork is similar, and it uses the same guests and contributors. Given my love of a gatefold sleeve I sort of maybe wish it was a double LP.

Cheval Sombre is probably going to be the sixth most posted artist in this series and the highest placed not to have once been a member of Galaxie 500. 

The top ten probably looks something like this _(although it's a bit muddled because of collabs and my weird definitions)_:

1. Luna
2. Galaxie 500
3. Damon & Naomi
4. Dean & Britta
5. Dean Wareham
6. Cheval Sombre
7. Magic Hour
8. The Pastels
9. Fuxa
10. Cagney & Lacee
