On release Luna's debut album only ever appeared on vinyl through Australian indie Summershine records. In 2015 it appeared on vinyl as part of the Captured Tracks [Long Players 92-99](/database/luna/releases/long-players-92-99/) box set. But it wasn't until early 2023 before it got it long-deserved vinyl reissue.

The reissue was through Run Out Groove records who are part of Warner Music Group who have the questionable business model of taking money up front for these deluxe releases which, in the wake of the [Bandbox debacle](/2024/03/06/bandbox-files-for-an-assignment-for-the-benefit-of-creditors/) only seems more questionable. The release was announced (after a _vote_ to see whether it got selected for resissue) in May 2022, and customers were given _until 31st May_ to pre-order the album - which, for me in the UK, cost $55.97 including shipping.

This was during a global cost of living crisis...

<blockquote>
<p>Food prices rose sharply during 2022 and 2023, as global supply chain disruptions and the effects of Russiaâ€™s full-scale invasion of Ukraine lifted the input costs of food producers.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Another important driver of high inflation has been energy prices, with household energy tariffs and road fuel costs increasing in 2022. Gas prices increased to record levels after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and continued to rise during much of 2022 due to cuts in Russian supply. Electricity prices are linked to gas prices and followed a similar trend. The largest jump in prices was in April 2022</p>

Admittedly ROG were up-front about the lead time but their threats of this being a _limited release_ exploited fans who wanted this, it's not as if Warner's were strapped for cash...

<blockquote>
In 2023, Warner Music Group reported revenues of 6.03 billion U.S. dollars. The record company has seen its revenues grow consistently for the last few years after a small decline in 2015, and despite the 2020 figure marking a slight decrease, 2023 had the highest revenue recorded to date.

My copy arrived on the 27th February 2023, nine months after Warner's had taken my money. Now, I know I didn't have to buy this, and I know that I was in work and could afford it but the point is that it is still a very poor business model in my opinion. Perhaps better would have been to have taken a small deposit and trust the customer to pay the rest on release - after all honour and trust should work both ways?

Having said all that - it is a very beautiful package, a lovely gatefold sleeve, a bonus disc of Dean's Luna demos, plus Egg Nog. I am very glad I have a copy.
