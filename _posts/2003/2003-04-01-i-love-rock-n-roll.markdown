Dean Wareham has recently added a short "diary" piece to fuzzywuzzy with a few thoughts on war, on the recent Knitting Factory shows and with the revelation that Luna's only forthcoming show is opening for former Runaways rock goddess Joan Jett (as well as Runaways wannabes The Donnas). Of course I considered this to be some sort of joke but scouring the net did indeed confirm that the show was taking place and that Luna were on the bill.You can catch this fascinating (?) show at Brown University, Providence, RI on the 10 April.Hello Daddy, Hello Mom, I'm your Cherry Bomb.
