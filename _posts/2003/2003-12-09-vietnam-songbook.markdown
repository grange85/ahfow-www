<p>Back in March Dean Wareham was part of an event celebrating the "protest song tradition". The event was held in New York City and featured live performances from such legendary figures as Pete Seeger, Lenny Kaye and Thurston Moore. I recently came across as web site celebrating this unique event with pictures and music (including an mp3 of Dean;s contribution). Well worth a visit.http://www.vietnamsongbook.org/home.htm</p>
