<p>As I had some requests I thought I'd pop this up sooner rather than later.<br />This track is from the demos that Dean Wareham recorded for Elektra back in 1991. Just to remind you here's the same extract from fuzzywuzzy that I used for last months track...<br />"In 1991, after leaving Galaxie 500, Dean Wareham signed a demo deal with Elektra Records, and recorded some demos with drummer Jimmy Chambers of Mercury Rev. Songs included Anesthesia, I Can?t Wait, and Slash Your Tires. Anesthesia was released as a single (under the name Dean Wareham) on Number 6 records."<br />Feedback and suggestions always appreciated!</p>
