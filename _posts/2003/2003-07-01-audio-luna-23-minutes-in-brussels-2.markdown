<p>Actually I can't help but think that when this was performed it was called something else completely. While the tune is recognizable as 23 Minutes. It starts differently and has entirely different lyrics.<br />I guess this must be one of Luna's early shots at this from a show at Tramps, NYC in November of 1994, a full eight or nine months before Penthouse was released.<br />It still has that groove...<br />[thanks to Kiek for tracking this down]</p>
