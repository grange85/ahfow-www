As an introduction to this track I'll simply steal a section from fuzzywuzzy.com (the official Luna site)...

"In 1991, after leaving Galaxie 500, Dean Wareham signed a demo deal with Elektra Records, and recorded some demos with drummer Jimmy Chambers of Mercury Rev. Songs included Anesthesia, I Canâ€™t Wait, and Slash Your Tires. Anesthesia was released as a single (under the name Dean Wareham) on Number 6 records."

This then is the version of Slash Your Tires recorded for that session - the demo that was passed to me had, in addition, an interesting version of Crazy People which I'll probably chuck out as next months (or May's) track of the month.

Feedback and suggestions always appreciated!
