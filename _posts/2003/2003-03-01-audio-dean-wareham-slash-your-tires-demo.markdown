<p>As an introduction to this track 'll simply steal a section from fuzzywuzzy.com (the official Luna site)...<br />"In 1991, after leaving Galaxie 500, Dean Wareham signed a demo deal with Elektra Records, and recorded some demos with drummer Jimmy Chambers of Mercury Rev. Songs included Anesthesia, I Canâ€™t Wait, and Slash Your Tires. Anesthesia was released as a single (under the name Dean Wareham) on Number 6 records."<br />This then is the version of Slash Your Tires recorded for that session - the demo that was passed to me had, in addition, an interesting version of Crazy People which I'll probably chuck out as next months (or May's) track of the month.<br />Feedback and suggestions always appreciated!</p>
