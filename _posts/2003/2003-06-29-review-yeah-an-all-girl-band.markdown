<p>I made the arduous road trip to Chicago for Saturday's show at the Double<br />Door, and it was well worth the effort.  Beforehand, I stopped at<br />Lorraine's Diner, a greasy spoon, for some grub.  Never again.  I asked<br />about their mashed potatoes, if they were real or boxed.  The waitress<br />consulted with a greasy guy and told me they were canned.  So I got the<br />veggie omelet instead, which had more grease than egg.  I got to the venue<br />and found a spot to sit close to the stage for the warm-ups,  The area<br />smelled like a combination of stale cigarette smoke and fetid urine, but<br />hey - that's all just rock and roll.<br />The opening act was Gabardine, from Chicago.  They played somber,<br />melancholy, melodic music, similar to Low but with the gaps filled in very<br />beautifully; and featured an amply-bosomed cellist.  Other oddities:<br />kazoo, tiny piano, xylophone, and a killer E-bow on guitar.  Very good<br />music, but not meant for a bar loaded with clanking bottles and sorority<br />chatterboxes.  They have an EP available and an album made, but no one has<br />picked them up yet.<br />Oddly (or perhaps predicably) enough, the crowd shut up for Nash Kato,<br />former Urge Overkill guy, who played an acoustic set.  I concluded that I<br />must have different taste in music from all the svelte 23-year-old women<br />that were there, because they sure fawned over the guy's music while<br />hardly even opeing their ears for Gabardine, who I thought was far<br />superior.<br />Dean & Britta took the stage at 12:30, with Dean sporting his normal<br />attire and controlled bedhead.  Britta wore a white blouse with ultratight<br />black pants and open-toed heels, and a just-rolled-out-of-bed hairdo. <br />Lara had pants that matched Britta's, which was nice.  I couldn't see the<br />drummer much.  Dean & Britta were both sleepy-eyed during those rare<br />moments they actually had their eyes open.  They hit their stride<br />immediately on the opener, "Night Nurse", soaking the venue with a very<br />fresh sounding number that sounded a little different from the album<br />track.  There were some other highlights, including Britta's lovely "Your<br />Baby" (except for the a-holes in the crowd wondering about the<br />pre-recorded bass), where she seemed to have an I-don't-care stance but<br />looked and sounded delicious; Moonshot (the best song of the night, with<br />Dean & Britta's harmonies giving me chills, as well as Dean's guitar at<br />the end); and Knives of Bavaria, where Britta succulently dished out what<br />appeared to be a pretty tricky melody from her bass.  I thought it was<br />also nice to see Britta shrouded under blue light for the show, but more<br />attention to isolation of just her on her two main songs would have been<br />more poignant.  The show was a quick hour and five minutes, but was full<br />of great music and only a couple disappointments (more of Dean's guitar<br />mastery would have been great).<br />Other stuff: Early on, someone from the crowd shouted, "Nice ladies,<br />Dean!"  He smiled and said, "Yeah, an all-girl band."  Someone also asked,<br />"What's up with Luna?", and Dean said they were practicing.  There was the<br />ubiquitous, "I love you Britta!" a couple times too.  After the show, they<br />stuck around to say hi, which was nice.  I also met three other fans from<br />Omaha there, which was a nice surprise.  When I returned to my car, I had<br />a memorable encounter with Chicago's finest, who just about hauled me away<br />in the paddywagon for attempting to urinate in a back alley.  As it was,<br />they left me with nothing more than a "Have a nice night" and the<br />inability to pee for the next two hours.</p>
