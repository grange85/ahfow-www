<p>Do you have or know of any Galaxie 500 video material,either broadcast or bootleg? Damon & Naomi are trying to collect as much Galaxie 500 video as possible, primarily for archival reasons but also with a view to releasing a DVD at some point in the future. Please help if you can.More details: http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/index.php?type=2&article_id=96</p>
