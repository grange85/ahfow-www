<p>This cover of a Buffy Sainte-Marie track (the title track of a 1972 album) was recorded for Galaxie 500's second Peel Session on 30 October 1990. The session was broadcast on John Peel's BBC Radio One show on 4 November 1990.<br />Another Galaxie 500 track that makes the box set seem incomplete.</p>
