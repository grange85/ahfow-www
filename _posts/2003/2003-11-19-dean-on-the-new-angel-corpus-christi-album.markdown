<p>I've just noticed that Angel Corpus Christi has released a new album, Divine Healer, that includes both tracks from the Emma's House 7" single that featured Dean Wareham on the A-side (You) and a cover of Luna's I Want Everything on the flip.sources:http://www.angelcorpuschristi.com/http://www.gullbuy.com/buy/2003/11_18/angelcorpuschristi.cfm</p>
