<p>There are plans afoot to try and collect as much video footage of Galaxie 500 as possible, primarily so that the material can be collected and preserved/digitised but also with a view to releasing a DVD at some point in the future.<br />In order to get hold of the material Damon & Naomi are asking that if anyone has ANY video of Galaxie 500 - either bootleg or from TV broadcast - if they could possibly send it to them. Preferably the master material rather than copies in PAL or NTSC format<br />Additionally if you have any information or recollections of Galaxie 500 TV appearances that would be really appreciated providing as much detail as possible (country, channel, programme, date etc.)<br />Any original tapes sent will be returned if required.<br />Please send videos to:<br /> The Galaxie 500 Video Archive <br /> c/o Exact Change<br /> 5 Brewster Street<br /> Cambridge, MA 02138<br /> USA<br />Europeans can, if they prefer, cut down on postage costs by sending them to<br /> The Galaxie 500 Video Archive<br /> c/o  Andy Aldridge<br /> 85 Studley Grange Road<br /> London<br /> W7 2LU<br /> UK<br />and I'll make sure that the videos reach Damon & Naomi.<br />If you require the tapes returned could you please mark them clearly with your name and address - probably best stuck to the tape case/box.<br />Any enquiries can be emailed to video@exactchange.com</p>
