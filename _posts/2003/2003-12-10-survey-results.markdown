<p>The A Head Full of Wishes survey results are available at <del datetime="2012-12-23T11:33:53+00:00">http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/newsurvey_results.php</del> <ins datetime="2012-12-23T11:33:53+00:00"><a href="http://olddb.fullofwishes.co.uk/survey/view/2003" title="A Head Full of Wishes 2012 survey results">survey results 2003</a></ins> - with a bigger turnout than ever the results are pretty consistent with earlier surveys. Favourite Galaxie 500 album is still "On Fire" and "Penthouse" walked away with the fave Luna album category.</p>
