This is the ninth of (currently) ten Magic Hour entries in [my record collection](/category/my-record-collection) and is a pink vinyl version of the I Had a Thought / America single that has [already put in an appearance](/2024/03/28/my-record-collection-122-magic-hour-i-had-a-thought-america/).

The band recorded one Peel Session on the 3rd May 1994 and recorded a version of I Had a Thought. The session was broadcast on 10th June 1994 and, to my knowledge, has never been repeated. Fortunately you can [hear the session on AHFoW](/2013/10/04/audio-magic-hour-peel-session/).

Since the last copy was definitely an eBay purchase I guess I must have bought this around the time of release.
