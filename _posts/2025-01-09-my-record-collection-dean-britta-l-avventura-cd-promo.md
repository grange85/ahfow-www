Another CD promo for Dean & Britta's L'Avventura, the [first was for the 2003 Jetset release](/2024/05/30/my-record-collection-140-dean-britta-l-avventura-promo-cd/) and this one for the 2008 Double Feature re-issue so I guess Dean and/or Britta sent me this copy then (I really ought to make better notes about how things arrive in my collection).

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/dean-and-britta-lavventura-promo-2008.jpg" "Dean & Britta - L'Avventura (2008 promo CD)" %}

This copy came in a simple paper sleeve with a window, and just has the artist, title, catalogue number (CD-DBL-0001 - the first release on Dean & Britta's Double Feature Records), and a bit of copyright stuff. It also has the URL of the disc manufacturer which is, of course, of no interest to anyone. What it ought to have is the URL of an EPK, that's what I'd do if I was trying to promote something. I assume this would have come with a paper press release but I don't have one (although I do have [one for the 2003 Jetset release](/2019/10/25/artefacts-021-dean-and-britta-lavventura-press-release/))

The album is named after a [Michaelangelo Antonioni film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Avventura) - but it's not a film I love so won't be re-watching it for this series (I last watched it in 2012 and rated it 3/10) - although, as there are a few copies of the album still to come in the series I might change my mind later - feel free to try and tell me why I should, if you think I should!
