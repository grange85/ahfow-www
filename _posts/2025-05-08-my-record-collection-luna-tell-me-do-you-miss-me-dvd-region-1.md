This is the US copy of the documentary of Luna's "farewell tour" of 2004/5 and is, obviously, pretty much the same as [the rest of the world copy](/2024/03/07/my-record-collection-116-luna-tell-me-do-you-miss-me-dvd-region-2-3-4-5/) with the exception of the region encoding. Wouldn't life have been easier for everyone if they had made it region free in the first place? It's not like it's hard to bypass region encoding anyway?

This, I think, was sent to me by the director Matthew, or maybe by Dean - I don't think I bought it (but did buy the UK copy). 

I must admit that it seems odd watching the film now that Luna are once again a going concern, like so many of the reasons for splitting up the band turned out not to be good enough to stay split up. That means that they should never have split up in the first place... wait, it just occurred to me that I've written this before... just shy of a year ago:

<blockquote>
Now, I tend to be of the opinion that when a band splits up, for good reasons, they should probably stay split up, and if there were good reasons to split up the reasons to get back together tend not to be as good (and are normally financial, which isnâ€™t a good reason at all - although it may be a valid one!) But these days bands get back together all the time, maybe they should just not split up? The word hiatus can be quite a useful one.

... but, I still stand by that!

So... here I am watching it again - but this time with the commentary track, which I probably haven't listened to since it first arrived...

I'm not sure how enjoyable the commentary is without the accompanying pictures but... I ripped it to an mp3 all the same:
