I miss the days when you'd find a stack of videos on YouTube the day after a show... instead they get posted on platforms that are unsearchable and disappear into oblivion. Luckily one kind soul has posted a fab clip of Luna playing 23 Minutes in Brussels at the second of their two recent shows in Texas...

{% ahfowvideo "MocvRZA_EUw" "Luna - 23 Minutes in Brussels - Dallas (December 2025)" %}

Hopefully more clips will turn up at some point... and hopefully some of their end of year shows with Yo La Tengo.
