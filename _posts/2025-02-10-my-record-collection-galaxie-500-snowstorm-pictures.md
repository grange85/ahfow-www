This is a [another copy](/2023/11/09/my-record-collection-085-galaxie-500-snowstorm-pictures-7/) of the limited edition single that was given away with the [double DVD of Galaxie 500 videos](/2024/11/11/my-record-collection-187-don-t-let-our-youth-go-to-waste-dvd/) released by Plexifilm in 2004.

You could only get the single if you pre-ordered the set direct from Plexifilm... or at least that was the case until it was popped in the 20-20-20 shop in 2013. Which I guess means that Plexifilm didn't manage to sell 500 copies on pre-order. To be honest I'd be surprised if they did - 500 seems like a lot of copies.

I'm listening to the single again, and again wincing at poor Dean's wrecked voice. Watch them play Pictures and wince along with me...
