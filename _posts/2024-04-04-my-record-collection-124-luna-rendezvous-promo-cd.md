As promised [a couple of weeks back](/2024/03/21/my-record-collection-120-luna-rendezvous-lp/) here is the promo CD of Luna's final album _Rendezvous_ that I scrounged off Jetset shortly after the album was announced.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/luna-rendezvous-promo.jpg" "Luna - Rendezvous (promo CD)" %}

I was quite excited to get a copy of the album and posted as much to the Galaxie 500 Mailing List with a few thoughts. A couple of people took exception to my comments - suggesting that I was somehow posting _spoilers_, that I'd probably ripped and shared the CD to file-sharing websites, and that I wouldn't buy the record now I'd got it for nothing. I apologised but ffs how can you _spoil_ an album (ok... maybe a _concept_ album) - it's not like I'd posted a track-by-track analysis, I'd literally said I'd heard it and that I loved Speedbumps.

For the most part the mailing list was a cool place to hang out but sometimes...

Anyway, the album promotion had started, Pitchfork had posted a tracklisting, so I emailed Jetset and asked for a copy and they sent me this CD in a card sleeve. 

When Dean ranked Luna's albums he put Rendezvous in second place and said "I didn't like it that much at the time. I was just tired of Luna. But when I listen to it now, I think it's really catchy" - I too was probably a little cool on release so found things to bother me about it. But the album is great - Malibu Love Nest is such a great album opener (although Luna always knew how to start an album perfectly), and I still adore Speedbumps.

I wasn't happy about everything though...

<blockquote>
<p>I must admit that I'm still not entirely comfortable with hearing Luna
without hearing Dean. I love both of Sean's songs and they're close
enough to Luna to not bother me too much but I'm sorry but I can't
love then AS Luna songs.</p>

<p>I really have, over the years, tried to think of Luna as _A band_ not
_DEAN'S band_ - but hearing someone else sing Luna songs just isn't
sitting right with me at the moment...</p>

<p>"Still at Home" is a track I'd buy an album for so I'm looking forward
to hearing Sean in his own band (SEAN'S band!).</p>

So... Sean, how's that solo album coming along?
