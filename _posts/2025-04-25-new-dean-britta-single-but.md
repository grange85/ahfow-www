PIAPTK have just [announced the release of a new single by Dean & Britta](http://piaptk.com/products/866479-dean-and-britta-nyc-single-patreon-freebie) - a one sided, two track release - but... in order to get yourself a copy you had to be a subscriber, at the $10 per month level, to their Patroen on the 12th April- and apparently that was just 85 folk.

Which I guess makes this post a bit of a tease since if you aren't already you probably won't be getting a copy (until they arrive at a ridiculous price on Discogs).

The single contains two covers - Lou Reed's "A Gift" and Simon & Garfunkel's Homeward Bound.

Homeward Bound first got an outing by Dean & Britta at a Simon & Garfunkel songbook event in Central Park in 2010 - and was later played during their lockdown concerts.
