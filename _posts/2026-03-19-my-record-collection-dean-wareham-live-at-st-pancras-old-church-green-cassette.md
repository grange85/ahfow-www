So this is my fourth post covering the six copies I have of recordings from Dean's shows in London in 2013 so I guess there's not a great deal more for me to say!?

The original release was on cassette and came in two flavours one in a green shell and one in a red shell. The cassette j-card was the same for both but since it was printed on diaphanous paper it gives the impression that the difference is more than just the shell of the cassettes, and to reinforce the eye for detail the green ones came with a download code on red paper, and the red one on green.

There's a fair chance that the download code in the picture above hasn't been used so if you're quick (and interested) you can grab yourself a free download!

Dean gave me a copy of both cassettes after his show at The Prince Albert in Brighton in May 2014... so I guess I can pad out this short post with a clip of Dean and band playing Tugboat at that show... and discussing air-conditioning!
