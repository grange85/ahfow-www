Here's another release that doesn't fit my criteria but I've decided that having both Britta **and** Kramer is enough to push it past the "direct relationship to a former member of Galaxie 500" rule - _2 x 2 hops = 1 hop_

I nearly didn't buy this "mini ep" \<[eye-roll](/2023/07/06/my-record-collection-049-dean-wareham-emancipated-hearts-vinyl/)\>, it was a bit pricey and with overseas shipping I decided to pass on it and bought the [digital version on Bandcamp](https://deanandbritta.bandcamp.com/album/nocturnes) instead.

But it is very lovely, and I kept coming across it on... [Dean & Britta's Bandcamp](https://deanandbritta.bandcamp.com/album/nocturnes), in [Dean's shop](https://deanwareham.com/product/914785), and then... in [a UK record shop on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/Juno_Records)... so I bought it - which means I've bought it twice and probably would have been cheaper if I'd bought the single in the first place!

 - *Catalogue Number:* AHFOW 11/0080

 - *Title:* Nocturnes EP
 - Bought on Discogs for Â£9.50 + postage
