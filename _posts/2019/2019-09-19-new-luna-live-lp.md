Luna have announced than an LP of songs recorded on their _farewell_ tour of 2004/5 will be available to buy on their upcoming US tour.

The songs were recorded for the Matthew Buzzell documentary Tell Me Do You Miss Me and the release was [described by the band on their Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2mHJ0GFY8d/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) as a 'quasi-bootleg LP'.

The LP will be limited to 750 numbered copies and will be initially only available on their upcoming US tour - any left over at the end of the tour will be made available online.
