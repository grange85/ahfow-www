<p class="lead">Galaxie 500's final album is getting a limited edition re-release <a href="https://www.newburycomics.com/products/galaxie_500-this_is_our_music_exclusive_lp?variant=28691601784937">exclusively through Newbury Comics</a>.</p>

Following on from the lovely orange vinyl On Fire released earlier in the year, 20\|20\|20 are releasing a _blue swirl_ vinyl copy of Galaxie 500's brilliant (and criminally under-appreciated) final album This Is Our Music. The album pressed from the 2009 remaster will be available exclusively through independent record shop Newbury Comics and is limited to 500 copies.

The record is available to order now and will be released on the 19th July.

<blockquote>
  Galaxie 500's ambitious final album, remastered for LP in 2009. The nine song set originally recorded in 1990 includes their cover of Yoko Ono's 'Listen, the Snow is Falling'.
