Now... here's a thing - I love the whole of On Fire so putting together a post about each of the tracks would be easy... right!?

Nope - Leave The Planet, doesn't appear to have been performed live (except in Dean's recent On Fire shows), doesn't seem to have been picked by bands to cover, and doesn't seem to have folk on the internet waxing lyrical about it. Which is a shame - it deserves better.

Luckily, what it does have is a band named after it  - well, I'll assume that [Leave The Planet](https://leavetheplanet.bandcamp.com/) are named after the Galaxie 500 song which I think is a fair assumption given that this happened for Record Store Day a few years ago...

You can buy it, and lots more [Leave The Planet on their Bandcamp page](https://leavetheplanet.bandcamp.com/).

_As On Fire approaches it's 30th birthday I thought I'd post a series of posts of randomness about each of the tracks on the album - some from me and some from other fans._
