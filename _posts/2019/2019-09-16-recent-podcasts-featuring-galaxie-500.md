I've just come across a couple of podcasts with decent Galaxie 500 content that are worth checking out on your commute!

**[Album Infinitum](https://www.spreaker.com/show/album-infinitum)** is a discussion show where they dedicate a series of shows to work through an artists albums and just ramble on about them. At the end of August they started working through Galaxie 500's all-too-short discography.

- [Album Infinitum - Today (26 August)](https://www.spreaker.com/user/hootnwaddle/ai-28-today)
- [Album Infinitum - On Fire (9 September)](https://www.spreaker.com/user/hootnwaddle/ai-29-on-fire)
- Album Infinitum - This Is Our Music (coming soon!)

The hosts are charming and knowledgeable and it's been enjoyable listen. Previous episodes have run through the discographies of Squeeze and Aimee Mann amongst others.

**[C86 Show](https://www.c86show.org/)** is a long-running podcast where David Eastaugh interviews indie and rock luminaries at length about their career. The latest edition features an interview with Dean Wareham (recorded at the beginning of 2018 so it's a bit out of date).
