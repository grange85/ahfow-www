Another bonus artefact this week as it's Dean Wareham's birthday, so today's artefact is this rather innocuous, cheap C60 cassette.

After years of resisting I finally got the nerve up to speak to Dean after their show at The Astoria in October 1997. Dean crouched at the edge of the stage and chatted, signed my ticket. I don't really remember giving him my number, but I must have done because a few days later he called me from Brussels!

Luckily, I wasn't in - which means that instead of awkward conversation and something transient, and fading into the mists of time (maybe it was a dream!?), what I have is this TEAC C60 cassette with a message from Dean on it...

> Andy, this is Dean Wareham from Luna calling I'm in Brussels... erm, you're not there I'll try you another time...

 {% ahfowaudio {
  "audiourl": "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/audio/dean-wareham-28-seconds-from-brussels.mp3",
  "audiocap": "Andy, this is Dean Wareham from Luna...",
  "sourceurl": "",
  "sourcecap": "Source: Dean Wareham - Answerphone message, October 1997"
  } %}

My mind was of course blown which is why I still have a TEAC C60 cassette in the AHFoW archives!

I don't think he did ever try another time, or if he did he didn't leave a message.

Happy birthday Dean!

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
