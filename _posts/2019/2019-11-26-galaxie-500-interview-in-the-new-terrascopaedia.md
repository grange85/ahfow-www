The latest edition of the [gorgeous letterpress music magazine Terrascopaedia](https://www.ptolemaic.co.uk/terrascopaedia.html) is now available to order and includes an interview with the members of Galaxie 500 (by A Head Full of Wishes).

Terrascopaedia is descended from the Ptolemaic Terrascope which during its run from 1988 until its closure in the early 2000s was a great supporter of the band. Terracopaedia however is a much different beast - a beautiful and lovingly crafted hand-printed and hand-constructed - magazine.

> Published November 2019, the 13th issue features interviews with Garcia Peoples, The Rose City Band and Galaxie 500 plus reviews of new and upcoming releases of a Terrascopic nature.  
> ​  
> 125 copies produced. Each copy is entirely hand made from cover to cover, typeset in 12pt Caslon Old Face type, letter by letter and word by word. It's lovingly printed in full colour on unbleached, hand cut 7" square paper on a fully restored 1926 vintage, 10cwt Arab Foolscap Folio treadle press.

As the run is so small, and sells out fast, I'd suggest not hanging around if you want a copy - you can [order one from the Ptolemaic Press website](https://www.ptolemaic.co.uk/terrascopaedia.html) for £9 incl postage to the UK, £10 to the EU, or £12 anywhere else.
