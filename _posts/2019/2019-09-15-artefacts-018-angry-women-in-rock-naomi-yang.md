Happy birthday Naomi!

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/48506259441/in/photostream/" title="Naomi Yang in Angry Women in Rock Volume 1"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48506259441_d6148dfd71_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Naomi Yang from Angry Women in Rock Volume 1"></a>

In 1996 Naomi was interviewed by Andrea Juno for this book Angry Women in Rock Volume One. The book was published in New York and I never managed to track down a copy and admit that I stopped looking when another fan sent me a photocopy of Naomi's interview.

I struggled to come to terms with the idea that Naomi was an _Angry Woman_ of rock - I think she did too

> Do I have anything to say? Is this even an issue for me?

But, re-reading the interview she manages to be angry about...

- Music stores:

> The sales help tend to treat you like a jerk unless they recognize you from your Grammy award ceremony.

- Her music teacher

> He was making fun of simplicty.

- Madonna

> I think it's all self-promotion. That's pop culture and I feel very alienated from that.

- Major record labels

> Dens of evil. They're about mediocrity not music

- The industry of music

> So much that is venerated is really bad. It makes me distrust popularity.

The interview concludes with Naomi's _equipment list_ becuase...

> it always seemed to me that the equipment list was the best thing about \[_Guitar Player_\]

so...

Naomi's equipment list (1996)

> Cherry red 1968 Gibson EB-2DC bass (semi-hollow-bodied bass, shaped like a 335 Gibson guitar), Trace Eliot AH200 amp head and a single 15" EV speaker for playing live, old Ampeg B-18 Portaflex amp for recording, Boss Super Overdrive pedal (used rarely)

I finally saw a copy for real when a pal brought a copy over for me to look at, and I realised that I really ought to own a copy - and eBay made that easy. So now I have this gorgeous picture of Naomi with her dad's Rolleiflex TLR which in my photocopy was just a black mess!

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
