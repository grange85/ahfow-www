It turns out 1989 was an amazing year for music. It was for me anyway my life was changed in so many ways that year. Galaxie 500's On Fire was one of those ways. It entered my life on one side of a C90 cassette and hasn't left my life since. In spring of 2019 I had an idea that something needed to be done to celebrate 30 years of that life-changing occurrence.

This is what came of that idea. An idea that started as a fanzine but with help and encouragement from friends has turned into a beautiful artefact. A 28 page book taking the songs from the album as inspiration for visual and textual art by some fantastic artists, and an amazing 14 track CD containing a cover of the whole of On Fire by some fantastic bands and musicians.

Today you can pre-order On Fire \| 30 a tribute CD containing covers of all the tracks on On Fire (plus the tracks on the Blue Thunder EP).

The deluxe book and CD package is limited to 200 copies which contain the book, badges and postcards The book is a 7" square so it'll fit nicely in amongst your singles! 30 random copies will also have a numbered, signed, hand-printed lino-cut print.
