<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/48294025792/in/dateposted-public/" title="Flexidisc - Issue 48 of The Bob Magazine"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48294025792_9101292d65_c.jpg" width="800" height="796" alt="Flexidisc - Issue 48 of The Bob Magazine"></a>

This demo version of Luna's Going Home was released on a flexidisc given away with issue 48 of The Bob magazine.

To be honest I'm not too sure how this came into my possession, the stickers suggest I bought it at a Notting Hill Gate Record & Tape Exchange for Â£1.50 (there's a cheaper price stuck to the back of the disc) - but I don't remember doing that, although I bought a lot of stuff from the exchanges so it's perfectly possible. Maybe I was sent it by another fan (thanks if I did that and it was you) or I bought it on eBay or Discogs (but can't find any evidence of that).

Anyway... I have a copy!

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
