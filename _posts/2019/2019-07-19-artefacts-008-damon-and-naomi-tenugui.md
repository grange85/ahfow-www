These very limited Damon & Naomi tenugui were sold on their _Lost Gaijin tour_ of Japan at the tail of 2009 - I was lucky enough to have been sent one by Naomi that for a while looked like it had gone astray in the postal system. It arrived in February 2010 - I tried it out but I looked a bit <a href="https://flic.kr/p/7Ah21G">too much like a biker</a> for it to get regular use!

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
