<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/47984559351/in/dateposted/" title="Luna Romatica promo stickers"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47984559351_6c902bc730_c.jpg" width="800" height="545" alt="Luna Romatica promo stickers"></a>

When Luna released Romantica Dean sent me a promo CD and a bunch of these stickers - one was inscribed _For Adam love Dean_ - when Romantica came out Adam wasn't even five so wasn't getting his sticker. He still hasn't got it.

One did find it's way onto one of my record boxes but I still have three (including Adam's) filed away.

_I thought I'd just go through some of the stuff I've acquired over the years and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
