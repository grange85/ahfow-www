I'd guess that Tell Me is probably one of the lesser known tracks from On Fire - I always wonder how hard it must be sequencing an album so the balance and transitions work. I think that is one of the things that makes On Fire so great. It's not just _all killer and no filler_ but the sequencing is flawless. Tell Me isn't _lost_ after Blue Thunder but is a gentle come down.

There's a lovely live version recorded for MTV in the UK back then - with Damon playing second guitar (and not drums obv) - it was released on the Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste DVD.

I think I only noticed how truly sad Tell Me is when <a href="https://ballboy.bandcamp.com/album/the-sash-my-father-wore-and-other-stories">ballboy's cover came out in 2003</a> - I think that's because it's drenched in cello - which might be the saddest sounding of the strings family. I've <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2016/11/24/my-favourite-galaxie-500-covers-3-ballboy-tell-me/">written about my love of ballboy's cover before</a>.

_As On Fire approaches it's 30th birthday I thought I'd post a series of posts of randomness about each of the tracks on the album - some from me and some from other fans._
