<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/48260870377/in/dateposted/" title="Damon &amp; Naomi promo (photo by Macioce) - 1992"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48260870377_fe0ee125d9_b.jpg" width="776" height="1024" alt="Damon &amp; Naomi promo (photo by Macioce) - 1992"></a>

This beauty only recently came into my collection - sent to me by Andrew (along with lots of other gems, thanks Andrew!). The photo is by [Macioce (who has recently started posting his wonderful photos on Instagram)](https://www.instagram.com/maciocephotography/). 

Taken in 1992 in the shoot for the [More Sad Hits](/database/damon-and-naomi/releases/damon-and-naomi-more-sad-hits/) album cover, this photo isn't the one that appeared on the back of the album - [Macioce posted another out-take from the session over here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsr_tFm-l/).

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
