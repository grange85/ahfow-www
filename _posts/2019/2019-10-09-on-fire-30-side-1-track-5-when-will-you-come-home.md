> "When Will You Come Home?" was about a night I watched Kojak on TV while waiting for Claudia to come home from a party - this was in the early stages of our relationship, when I was insecure about whether she liked me.

For research I sat and watched Kojak on my own, on my phone a few weeks back!

Also I did a drawing!

> Wasn't there an animal related controversy about "When Will You Come Home"?  
>  
> *Damon*: Sergio gravitated to violent imagery for all the videos, I think in part to undermine the band's pastoral reputation, but also it's also always anchored somehow to the lyric. It was a briliant leap. I still can't watch "When Will You Come Home" without flinching, however.

> *Dean*: There was a bit of controversy. We were asked to re-cut the video because it contained disturbing images of animals that had been used in scientific experiments. But then MTV ran the original version anyway. It was confusing.

_As On Fire approaches it's 30th birthday I thought I'd post a series of posts of randomness about each of the tracks on the album - some from me and some from other fans._
