The always excellent NYCTaper has just posted a [lovely recording of the last night of Luna's tour at The Bowery Ballroom last weekend](http://www.nyctaper.com/2019/10/luna-october-20-2019-bowery-ballroom/).  The show featured the band performing the whole of Penthouse followed by a wonderful crawl through the bands past. Former bassist Justin Harwood guested for part of the show.

> Sunday night at Bowery was a Penthouse night and the band’s first set was a meticulous performance of the album, with personal favorite “23 Minutes in Brussels” as my highlight. After a brief intermission, the band returned to play the bonus or hidden track of “Bonnie and Clyde”, followed by a neat set of favorites, oddities, and a couple of covers. The final encore was “IHOP”, the lead track from the Pup Tent album that is virtually never played live — it was a personal request from a band superfan who despite travelling all over the country and indeed internationally to see Luna had never experienced this song live. This tour was like that — tricks and treats for the superfans and just plain great music for the rest of us.

You can [head over to NYCTaper and download the full show](http://www.nyctaper.com/2019/10/luna-october-20-2019-bowery-ballroom/) in lossless or lossy formats - or stream the show if you prefer.
