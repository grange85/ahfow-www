> We got a letter from this band telling us how they'd played the whole of the 'On Fire' album at this gig - in order. We thought it was particularly funny because we can't play 'Isn't it a Pity' because it's too hard. We're thinking of hiring them to do our American tour.

Here he is with Britta and Jonathan and Grasshopper from Mercury Rev in 2010

_As On Fire approaches it's 30th birthday I thought I'd post a series of posts of randomness about each of the tracks on the album - some from me and some from other fans._
