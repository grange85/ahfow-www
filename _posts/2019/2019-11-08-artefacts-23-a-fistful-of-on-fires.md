Just to reinforce yesterday's On Fire love in the wake of [On Fire \| 30 tribute album](/2019/11/07/on-fire-30-new-galaxie-500-tribute-cd-and-book-from-ahfow/), today's artefact is actually six artefacts: some of my copies of Galaxie 500's masterpiece.
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/49033619767/in/dateposted-public/" title="On Fire"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49033619767_80bd2e7a10_b.jpg" width="803" height="1024" alt="On Fire"></a>

The picture is actually already out of date because it's missing the beautiful orange vinyl copy that was released earlier this year (plus another cassette copy I acquired at some point).

The important one is the tatty bottom CD which was the one I bought on release day in 1989, it has been very well loved (and reaffirms my belief that LPs are aesthetically more pleasing than CDs because they age so much more graciously - a crease is more beautiful than a scratch or a crack - and artfacts should age).

1989/90 was clearly my vinyl to CD transition period - Today I bought on vinyl before I bought this - the Blue Thunder EP I bought on vinyl, after this.

This is missing:

The bottom vinyl LP is a UK Rough Trade copy from 1989 and the cassette is also a 1989 vintage Rough Trade release. The others are a Domino release double CD, a beuatiful Video Arts Japan CD, and a 20\|20\|20 LP.

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
