{% ahfowimage "/images/sean-the-cfr-hedbant.jpg" "The CFR - Hedbant" %}
Luna guitarist Sean Eden is working with a new outfit called The CFR (The Council on Foreigh Relations) along with Christy Davis and David Voight (formerly of The Weeds of Eden).

The band have just [released their first music on Bandcamp](https://thecfr.bandcamp.com/album/hedbant). Hedbant is an album of mostly improvised rock that's well worth checking out.

It's available to stream for free, or buy for cheap - and is well worth doing either - or both.

Sean tweeted...
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks Andy, I&#39;m currently in the pacific theater engaged in a covert CFR propaganda campaign, surveillance footage coming soon. <a href="https://t.co/EbW1uixSxb">https://t.co/EbW1uixSxb</a> <a href="https://t.co/9NZe9FGbyJ">pic.twitter.com/9NZe9FGbyJ</a></p>&mdash; Sean Eden (@SeanEden) <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanEden/status/1159264104327987200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

So sit tight for more!
