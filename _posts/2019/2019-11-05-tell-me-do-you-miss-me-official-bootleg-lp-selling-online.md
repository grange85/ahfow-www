The remaining copies of the limited edition live LP that Luna sold on their recent US tour are now available online.

In the US you can [head over to Luna's online store](https://lunamusic.com/tell-me-do-you-miss-me) to grab a copy and in Europe, [Wouldn't Waste Records have been selling them](https://ww-records.com/store.html#!/products/luna-tell-me-do-you-miss-me) (although they may already be sold out).

> A limited, numbered edition of 750 in a plain black sleeve this LP features live songs from different cities during the 2004-5 "farewell" tour, as featured in the Matthew-Buzzell-directed documentary Tell Me Do You Miss Me. Songs were recorded live to multi-track by Jason Raboin, and mixed by Ray Ketchem and Sean Eden. Attached to this email is the exciting (to me, anyway) 9-minute version of "Black Postcards" that appears on the album -- this one recorded live at the Bowery Ballroom in 2005.
