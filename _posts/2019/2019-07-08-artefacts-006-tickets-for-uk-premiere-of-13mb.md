<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/48199920386/in/dateposted/" title="13 Most Beautiful at The Carnegie Hall"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48199920386_b11c1261c3_c.jpg" alt="13 Most Beautiful at The Carnegie Hall"></a>

Sneaking an extra _artefact_ in this week as today is the 10th anniversary of the first UK performance of Dean & Britta's splendid _13 Most Beautiful: Songs for Andy Warhol's Screen Test_ that happened at the Carnegie Hall in Dunfermline, Scotland.

So, today's artefact are our tickets from the fantastic show. You can [read my gushings from ten years ago here](/2009/07/09/13-most-beautiful-at-the-carnegie-hall-in-dunfermline/).

There's some very low-res video of some of the show on youtube - but the audio's tolerable so nice to listen to, so I've converted them to mp3:

  } %}

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
