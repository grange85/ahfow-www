### On the 20th October 1989 Galaxie 500's masterpiece On Fire hit the streets for the first time ~ which means that come October the album will be 30 years old!

This got me thinking that this really **shouldn't be allowed to slip by uncommemorated**.

I'd like it to have a piece of created/creative art to represent each of the tracks on the original LP

But what qualifies as "art" is open to interpretation - but, in my mind there is...

 - pictures, prints, paintings, drawings, photography, words, essays, poetry, short stories
 - possibly also music - if it looks promising a side-order of cassette could be included - perhaps a track-by-track tribute album?

_(I'd like to steer clear of reminiscence pieces as that got fairly well covered in the Everything's Swirling fanzine a couple of years ago)_

If you would like to be involved please give me a shout by using one of the many other ways I'm reachable ~ [most are mentioned here](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/about/)!

Let me know if you have a track preference and what you could do.

I'm going to push this idea for a month and make a decision about whether to run with it in June.

If there's enough interest then at the beginning of June I will set up a forum where we can discuss, debate, share ideas and inspire each other!
