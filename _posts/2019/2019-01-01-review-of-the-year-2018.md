OK quickly throwing this together - plenty happened this year so check the rest of this site, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fullofwishes/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fullofwishes/) to fill in the many gaps!

### January
January saw Luna playing a few dates in the US before going quiet for a few months - here they are playing Tiger Lily in Pioneertown in a desert in California:

Meanwhile Damon & Naomi started preparing for a European tour with Thalia Zedek by releasing a video of the three of them covering Leonard Cohen:

I got [interviewed about the website](/2018/01/07/its-psychedelic-baby-interview-with-ahfow/) and being a fan, for online magazine It's Psychedlic Baby:

> Between Galaxie 500 splitting up in 1991 and me receiving my first email from a Galaxie 500 fan in 1994 or ’95, I thought I was the only Galaxie 500 fan in the world. My friends who’d come to the gigs with me didn’t seem to love them the way I did. Discovering that there were people who missed them as much as I did was a revelation, the Internet opened up to me doorways I could never have imagined, and the key to those doors was Galaxie 500.

Luna also recorded a session for KEXP:

### February
In February the great [Tom Rapp passed away](/2018/02/12/tom-rapp-1947-2018/), my encounters with Tom were brief, spread out and mostly online - but he always treated me like a friend not a fan. Here he is with Damon & Naomi at the first Terrastock festival in 1997:

Also in August some [Galaxie 500 live video saw the light of day](/2018/08/22/video-galaxie-500-london-1990/) - most of the bands show from 1990 at the Subterania in London - my first Galaxie 500 show and still my fave all time gig!
