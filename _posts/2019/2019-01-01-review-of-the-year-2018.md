<p class="lead">OK quickly throwing this together - plenty happened this year so check the rest of this site, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fullofwishes/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fullofwishes/">Instagram</a> to fill in the many gaps!</p>

<h2>January</h2>
<p>January saw Luna playing a few dates in the US before going quiet for a few months - here they are playing Tiger Lily in Pioneertown in a desert in California:</p>

<p>Meanwhile Damon & Naomi started preparing for a European tour with Thalia Zedek by releasing a video of the three of them covering Leonard Cohen:</p>

<p>I got <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2018/01/07/its-psychedelic-baby-interview-with-ahfow/">interviewed about the website</a> and being a fan, for online magazine It's Psychedlic Baby:</p>
<blockquote>Between Galaxie 500 splitting up in 1991 and me receiving my first email from a Galaxie 500 fan in 1994 or ’95, I thought I was the only Galaxie 500 fan in the world. My friends who’d come to the gigs with me didn’t seem to love them the way I did. Discovering that there were people who missed them as much as I did was a revelation, the Internet opened up to me doorways I could never have imagined, and the key to those doors was Galaxie 500.<footer><a href="http://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2017/12/an-interview-with-andy-aldridge.html">It's Psychedelic Baby (Jan 2018)</a></footer></blockquote>
<p>Luna also recorded a session for KEXP:</p>

<h2>February</h2>
<p>In February the great <a href="https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2018/02/12/tom-rapp-1947-2018/">Tom Rapp passed away</a>, my encounters with Tom were brief, spread out and mostly online - but he always treated me like a friend not a fan. Here he is with Damon & Naomi at the first Terrastock festival in 1997:</p>
