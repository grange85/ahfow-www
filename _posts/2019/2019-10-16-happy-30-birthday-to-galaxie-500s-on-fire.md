> ‘On Fire’, the new LP, is altogether a more considered - “slower, more lush, and more live” (Damon) affair than Today, proving conclusively there's more to GALAXIE 500 than their amps.    
> ‘On Fire’ is released on Rough Trade Records on 16th October 1989.

Today is the 30th anniversary of the release of Galaxie 500's masterpiece On Fire - there's not much more than I can say that hasn't been said repeatedly on this website over the last 25 years - so, just dig out the LP, or head over to the streaming service of your choice and ride the fiery breeze.

> Galaxie 500 haven't "gone" anywhere since "Today" because there's nowhere for them to _go_. They're all washed up, come to rest at the beautiful composure in defeat. If a Pyrrhic victory means triumph won at such a cost you might as well have lost, then Galaxie 500's music is the exact opposite; a statement of defeat that resounds like a glorious triumph. Let it bleed.  
> _Simon Reynolds (Melody Maker, 28th October 1989)_
