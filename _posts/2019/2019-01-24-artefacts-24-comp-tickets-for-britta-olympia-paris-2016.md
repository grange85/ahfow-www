Luna finished their 2016 European tour on a boat in Paris and while the rest of the band headed home Dean and Britta (and Hazel and I) hung around for a couple of days as Britta was doing a solo show supporting Keren Ann at the legendary Olympia. Today's artefacts are my comp tickets for the show.

I love that the tickets say _Britta_ - only her first name is needed like Cher and Madonna!

It was an absolute treat seeing her and Dean performing a sweet set for a sizeable crowd in such a great venue.

I had actually already bought tickets for the show which is why [my pics](https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/albums/72157675250349246) of Britta are from the comps in the stalls, and the pics of Keren Ann from the paid for seats in the circle!

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
