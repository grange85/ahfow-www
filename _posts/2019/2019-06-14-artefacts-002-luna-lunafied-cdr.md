In 2006 Rhino decided to release a digital-only album of Luna's covers. Lunafied arrived in the digital stores with an amazing [camera obscura sleeve by Abelardo Morell](http://www.abelardomorell.net/project/camera-obscura/) - but it only existed as a digital release which seemed a shame.

I emailed Dean to find out if it was likely to get a physical release some time, sadly not but Dean burnt me a CDR and mailed it off to me...

A different Lunafied did get a CD release as the second disc on the [Beggars Banquet Best of Luna CD](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/luna/releases/luna-best-of-luna/#beggars-banquet-cd) - but without the sleeve - although of course Best of Luna has a [brilliant Adrian Tomine sleeve](http://www.adrian-tomine.com/Illustrations.html) so I couldn't really complain! BTW Dean I'd love a vinyl release of that so I can have some 12" artwork!_

It was a long time coming but 13 years on a fantastic double LP of Lunafied arrived via Run Out Groove Records. It had all the tracks from both the US (digital) and the UK (Best of Luna) Lunafieds - and it had a gorgeous, glossy 12" sleeve with  Abelardo Morell's artwork.

[Dean's shop has a few copies of the lovely double LP Lunafied for sale](https://deanwareham.com/product/293305) - grab one while you can!

_I thought I'd just go through some of the stuff I've acquired over the years and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
