I can't remember when folk stopped sending me shows on cassette but suspect this was one of the last ones. It's a good recording of a show at The Knitting Factory in Los Angeles on Hallowe'en 2000 - Damon tweeted about that show...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There was the show with Ghost at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood, with Hollywood Blvd closed to traffic (for a parade? accident? both?). Audience limited to those who get around Los Angeles on foot - which included some amazing people, no joke! (I think <a href="https://twitter.com/jaywbabcock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jaywbabcock</a>? <a href="https://twitter.com/andyzax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@andyzax</a>?)</p>&mdash; Damon K (@dada_drummer) <a href="https://twitter.com/dada_drummer/status/1190035200136372224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2019</a></blockquote>

I've digitised the show and popped it up here to download

_(it just occurred to me that I *always* put up recordings of New York City when I share a Damon & Naomi mp3 - not sorry - it's beautiful - but I'll try and share one of their other beautiful tracks next time! Bet I forget though!)_

Anyway... Happy Hallowe'en!

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
