Sonic Cathedral will be selling off the remaining copies of their Singles Club releases during the day tomorrow, including the last copies of Luna's contribution.

The 7" single of Something In The Air was released in June as the fifth release of the excellent series, and there are just 283 copies anywhere in the world and 200 of those are already in the hands of subscribers so there ae very few left.

On Tuesday 10th December each hour from 1pm until 10pm (GMT) one release will be put on sale at the [Sonic Cathedral shop](https://shop.soniccathedral.co.uk) - Luna's single will be available from 5pm.

You can only order one copy and anyone trying to order more will end up with none.

So, set your alarms and [head off to the Sonic Cathedral shop](https://shop.soniccathedral.co.uk) to grab this gem!
