Excellent Danish live show sharing site [From The Basement](https://tdk-c90.blogspot.com/2019/10/2019-10-18-luna-new-york-elsewhere-hall.html) is currently sharing Luna's recent show from Brooklyn where they played the whole of their first album, Lunapark. The show also featured a guest appearance from Justin Harwood.

You can either grab the show in [lossless FLACs from Dimeadozen](http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=660757) or [lossy mp3s](https://mega.nz/#!uAEEyC4B!1MlZXx3YAZwOaIKBn7dx2ZdP2j57ERNJgMUls9b2GVA) direct from the site.

The site has also uploaded a bunch of great videos from the show to YouTube. Here's I Can't Wait...
