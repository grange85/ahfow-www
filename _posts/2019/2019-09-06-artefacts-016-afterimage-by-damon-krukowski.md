As today is Damon's birthday today's artefact is this beautiful little book of prose/poetry by Damon Krukowski, published by Ugly Duckling Presse in November 2011 it contains almost poems and almost diary entries and maybe truths and maybe imagines. The words are surrounded by Naomi's lovely photographs.

The book was released in an edition of 88 signed and hand-numbered - mine is 74.

There was also a special super-limited edition of 16 that came with a large print of one of Naomi's photos. I didn't buy one of those. Tempted though I was.

Happy birthday Damon

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
