<strong>INT. WEST LONDON VICTORIAN TERRACE HOUSE - THURSDAY MORNING - BREAKFAST</strong>

<em>The dining table is a mess. ANDY, HAZEL and ADAM 
are sitting down to eat their porridge.
One cat is milling around, another is sitting on the table. 
The radio is playing faintly in the kitchen.</em>

ANDY
Wait! Is that Galaxie 500 on the radio?
</center>
<em>listens intently</em>
<center>
ANDY
No. Shhh. It is, it's Galaxie 500. On the radio!
</center>
<em>Andy looks out of the window</em>
<center>
ANDY
B-b-b-but, it's not snowing, why are Galaxie 500 on the radio? 
</center>
<em>Adam walks into the kitchen and turns up radio</em>
<center>
ANDY
Ohhh!
<em>(reddens with embarrassment)</em>
</center>
<em>Hazel and Adam roll their eyes and get on with breakfast</em>

<em>Long, awkward pause</em>

<center>
HAZEL
Shouldn't you be going to work?
<em>(under her breath)</em>
Every flipping year!

Happy Galaxie 500 day - or whatever else you might choose to celebrate on this day.
