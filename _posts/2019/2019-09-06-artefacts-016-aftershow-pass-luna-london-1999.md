<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/48457628806/in/dateposted/" title="Luna aftershow pass - London 1999"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48457628806_2434bd6e9b_c.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="Luna aftershow pass - London 1999"></a>

The first time I was added to the guest-list for a Luna show was at The Embassy Rooms in London in 1999. I couldn't find anyone to come along to the show with me so my plus-one went begging. The guy on the door called me "Billy no-mates".

The show was sweltering and I was dripping with sweat by the end of it and not really in a fit state to hang out with the band! But I had a backstage pass and felt obliged to use it. I chatted with Dean, he showed me a pic of (very young) Jack, and gave me chocolates, and introduced me to Justin (the only time (so far) I've had a chance to speak to to him and it was nothing more than a polite hello).

I made my excuses as soon as I felt it was polite, and left.

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
