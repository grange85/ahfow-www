<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/48029368553/in/dateposted/" title="Note from Naomi with LP of Damon &amp; Naomi&#x27;s The Earth is Blue"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48029368553_efac3b3f62_c.jpg" width="800" height="800" alt="Note from Naomi with LP of Damon &amp; Naomi&#x27;s The Earth is Blue"></a>

My catalogue say that this note from Naomi came with my LP of The Earth is Blue - I don't think I bought the LP when the record was first released in 2005 but I did order a copy in 2013 when the Wondrous World bootleg edition was released so I guess this note is from then. I suppose I ought to take better records!

Sometimes The Earth is Blue is my favourite Damon & Naomi record (although most of their albums have a turn in that spot).

You can [_buy_ the album for whatever you feel like paying](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/the-earth-is-blue) (even if that's nothing!) on Damon & Naomi's bandcamp.

_I thought I'd just go through [some of the stuff I've acquired over the years](/category/artefacts/) and post about it here... how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary!_
