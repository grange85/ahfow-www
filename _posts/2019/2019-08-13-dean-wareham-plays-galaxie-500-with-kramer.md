Last night in Los Angeles <a href="/database/dean-and-britta/shows/2019/2019-08-12-dean-britta-zebulon-los-angeles-ca-usa/">Dean & Britta played a short surprise set</a> as part of Guy Blakeslee's The Butterfly Cabinet. They were joined by Galaxie 500's legendary producer Kramer for a couple of Galaxie 500 numbers.

Here's a video of them playing Blue Thunder and Hearing voices:
