### Luna's cover of Something in the Air is being released on 7" as part of the <a href="http://www.soniccathedral.co.uk/singlesclub/">Sonic Cathedral singles club</a>

The fifth release in the series will include the band's excellent cover of the Thunderclap Newman classic with Sean on vocals, and two previously unreleased tracks on the b-side. The song was previously only available digitally as part of Luna's crowdfunding campaign for A Sentimental Education but is now being released on beautiful _blue moon_ vinyl in a lovely package.

The single will be released on 20th June and singles club subscribers also get a bonus gift - which, if previous releases are anything to go by, will be a gem.

<a href="http://www.soniccathedral.co.uk/singlesclub/">Head over to Sonic Cathedral's site to subscribe</a> - some copies will reach shops but there will *only be 300 copies*, and 200 of those are reserved for subscribers so the safest way to ensure a copy will be to sign up for the club (and all four releases so far have been excellent). New subscribers will receive all four releases, the new Luna single and the remaining six records.
