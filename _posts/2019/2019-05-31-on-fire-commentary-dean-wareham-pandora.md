The streaming music service Pandora currently has a playlist where Dean chats about the making of On Fire. I think the playlist is for subscribers only but if you aren't subscribed you can sign up for a free 60 day trial. Non-US users might need to find a way of preteending they're from the US - but that's not hard - and a PayPal account and GMail address and a Zip code are all fairly easy to come by :)

I think it belonged to Sonic Youth who used to rehearse there. So the wah, and the bassline and the cymbal splashes&hellip; and lyrically it's a song not so much about a snowstorm but how excited the local news people and the weather people get when a storm's approcahing&hellip; they sort of go into a frenzy.
