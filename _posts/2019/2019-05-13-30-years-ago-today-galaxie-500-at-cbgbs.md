### "Thank you, thank you to the soundman ~ first time in New York"

Not much to say here I guess that isn't up there in the title - Galaxie 500 played CBGBs, in NYC on this day in 1989 - two tracks from the show were released first on the super-rare OFFICIAL galaxie 500 BOOTLEG CASSINGLE in 1989...

_(feel free to send me a copy if you have a spare one knocking around so I can put it in my 'museum' :) )_

... and later as a seven inch single on Bob Stanley's Caff label in 1990

The two tracks on both releases were covers of [The Beatles' Rain](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2014/03/19/originals-rain-by-the-beatles-covered-by-galaxie-500/) and [Jonathan Richman's Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2013/05/15/originals-dont-let-our-youth-go-to-waste-by-jonathan-richman-covered-by-galaxie-500/). When digital releases came around these were released for some reason as a single track, so for the price of one download from your [online retailer of choice](https://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/track/rain-dont-let-our-youth-go-to-waste) you get nearly 9 minutes of live Galaxie 500 perfection.
