So, the last credit on the back of Galaxie 500's debut album Today reads "Photograph by Eugene Atget" - back in 1990, without access to the Internet you'd just accept that sort of credit as it is, look at the lovely, and rather unusual, picture on the front, and then slip the record out of it's sleeve and get on with the business of listening.

So, for a long time I never really gave much thought to _Eugene Atget_. Things like _was he a friend of the band?_ or _what other albums covers he might have taken photos for_ just didn't cross my mind. But that all changed with the coming of the Internet, suddenly the urge to know everything can be satisfied - and those questions can now fairly easily be answered - for those two the answers are "no" and "none, because he didn't even take the photo _for_ this album".

Eugene Atget was a pioneer of photography who worked in the late 19th and early 20th century in Paris and was dead long before he could be commissioned to photograph for album covers. He took thousands of photographs of Paris and was considered a _documentary photographer_ - taking photographs to provide an archive of the architecture and life of Paris, and also would suuply photographs for artists such as painters and stage designers. As such his work only became recognised as _art_ after his death in 1927.
