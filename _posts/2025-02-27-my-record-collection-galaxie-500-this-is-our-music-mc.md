So, the seventh(!) copy of This Is Our Music is a Rough Trade US cassette copy that I guess I got on Discogs or eBay as a collection filler - I have a photo of it that I took in 2013 so, at least 12 years ago... I probably took a photo when it arrived so maybe _actually_ 12 years ago!

I'm always intrigued how designers decide to get a square bit of artwork onto a rectangular package - for TIOM at least some thought has gone into it (unlike the [Lunapark abomination](/2025/01/02/my-record-collection-luna-lunapark-elektra-cassette/) where it was dealt with by just squishing the artwork) - the gold block has been removed, but the pictures and words remain, albeit in different places. Inside the _Ray Agony_ "red photograph" remains, although... tiny. Otherwise it's just a smaller version of the CD, with more white space.

To be honest given the size of a cassette package I'm always surprised at how wasteful/careless/unimaginitive designers were with the little space they were given, thankfully cassettes are mostly a thing of the past, although they have made a recent resurgence, I guess because it's a cheap physical format to manufacture. I was never in love with cassettes as a release medium - obviously for sharing and recording and cheap distribution it had its place in the world! I do suspect that even less people have a cassette deck than have a record deck or CD player these days!
