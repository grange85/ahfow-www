Two of Lee Wall's snare drums are missing. The drums, a 1960's Gretsch and 1960's Ludwig were last seen packed in two Humes & Berg cases with Luna's equipment after the New Year's Eve Southpaw show. Modifications to the drums make them easily identifiable by the owner. If you have any information, please email:  fuzzmail@nyc.rr.com
