<p>I hassled film-maker Matthew Buzzell for a little bit of news about the forthcoming Luna film "Tell Me Do You Miss Me?" and he was kind enough to fill me in and while there's nothing too final about all this "news" at least it is from a good source!</p>
<p>The 103 minute film is almost complete - "the picture is locked and the sound mix has been completed". Matthew described it as "[not] a concert tour film [but] truly a documentary portrait of our favourite band" with "an appeal beyond the Luna fanbase".</p>
<p>The finished film will be submitted to a number of reputable film festivals and it is anticipated that it will "meet" the public some time in early to mid March 2006 with a DVD release in late spring with "some treats" as bonus material. The artwork and DVD packaging will be designed by <a href="http://www.frankolinsky.com/">Frank Olinsky</a></p>
