<p>A Head Full of Wishes will be going through a few changes in the next week or so. The navigation was getting a bit cluttered and ugly so I've decided to divide the site by artist - so beyond the main page there will be sections dedicated to Galaxie 500, Luna, Damon &amp; Naomi etc. with links to all the relevant places and news and tour dates specific to that artist.This will hopefully make the location of things a bit more obvious - comments about the changes will be very much appreciated (hopefully the guestbook will make a return at some point for this!).If you want a sneaky peek go here (but clicking on most links will suck you back to the current site) http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/index.php?a=2</p>
