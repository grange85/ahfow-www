<p>Happy New Year to all visitors.Tickets for Luna's last shows (at The Bowery Ballroom in NYC on the 26th and 27th of February) will go on sale TODAY at, I believe, noon. Don't miss out it should be something special.Other news: There's an mp3 of Dean, Britta and Sonic Boom doing a Roger Miller track available for download at http://www.fuzzywuzzy.comThis site's mp3 archive has been cut right back because of bandwidth issues. Most of the tracks are still available on Kiek's FTP server (see http://www.fullofwishes.info/galaxie/index.php?type=2&article_id=81 to find out more).</p>
