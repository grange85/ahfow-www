<p>OK - not really appropriate but hey this is my website and if I can't plug my own blog on here then where the hell can I do it.</p>
<p>The blog has existed for years but I've finally decided to give myself a right royal kick up the arse and actually post regularly rather than every couple of months. It'll mostly be about music with a bit of books, film and TV thrown in.</p>
