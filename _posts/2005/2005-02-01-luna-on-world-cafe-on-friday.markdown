<p>Luna will appear on World Cafe this friday. This from http://www.worldcafe.org/comingup.phpLuna is calling it quits but first they're going to join host David Dye on the World Cafe! They recently released their final album "Rendezvous" and they're obviously having a lot of fun as they stop by the Cafe on their lengthy farewell tour. Also David's planning to spin a bunch of new music!</p>
