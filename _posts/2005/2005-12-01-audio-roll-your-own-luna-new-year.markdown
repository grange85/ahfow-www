<p>A New Years Eve show became a Luna tradition and part of that tradition was a performance of George McCrae's disco anthem "Rock Your Baby". The song was written by Harry Wayne Casey and Rick Finch of KC and The Sunshine Band, and was a hit for McCrae in 1974.</p>
<p>This year for the first time in years there will be no traditional Luna New Year's Eve show, and no traditional rendition of Rock Your Baby so A Head Full of Wishes is proud to be able to offer you the opportunity to roll-your-own.</p>
<p>You can enjoy Luna's rendition from New Year's Eve 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004</p>
