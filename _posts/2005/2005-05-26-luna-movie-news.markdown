_Matthew Buzzell_, the director of the video document of Luna's farewell tour
gave me the latest on the project in an email last week. All the footage for
the movie, provisionally titled "Tell Me Do You Miss Me" has been viewed,
logged and digitised and the formal editing process is now underway. Editing
the film will be "big Luna fan" _Jacob Bricca_ who edited Matthew's previous
film [Jimmy Scott: If You Only
Knew](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293294/combined) (about Jazz singer Jimmy
Scott) and also edited [Lost in La
Mancha](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308514/combined), the documentary about
the catalogue of disasters during Terry Gilliam's attempt to make a film of
Don Quixote.

Hopefully the finished film will make an appearance at some festivals when
completed before being released on DVD by [Rhino](https://web.archive.org/web/20050526+/http://www.rhino.com/)
