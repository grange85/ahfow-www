<p>It seems that Rhino will be releasing a &quot;Best of Luna&quot; album in March of next year - no news on a tracklisting as yet but I have my ear to the ground. Release may or may not be tied in with Rhino's release of the Luna farewell tour documentary - tentatively titled &quot;Tell Me Do You Miss Me&quot;</p>
