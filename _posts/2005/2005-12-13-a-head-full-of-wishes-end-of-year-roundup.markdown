**Luna and after Luna**  
Well that was a year - Luna finally called it a day with a series of dates at
the Bowery Ballroom in New York City. The band had been touring the US and a
few shows in Europe and Japan since October of 2004. The emotional end came
with a teary rendition of 23 Minutes in Brussels and it was over.

Lee headed off to the US west coast to make music for adverts. His guitar
playing appeared in a series of (European) Levi's commercials that also
featured an appearance from Britta. He also turned up drumming on the new
album by [Bill Ricchini](https://web.archive.org/web/20051213+/http://www.billricchini.com/). Sean started pulling
together plans for a solo album as well as filling time playing with NYC band
[Elk City](https://web.archive.org/web/20051213+/http://www.elkcity.net/)

Britta, as well as her appearance in the aforementioned advert (and other work
in advertising) has been working with Dean preparing their second album which
will start recording with producer [Tony
Visconti](https://web.archive.org/web/20051213+/http://www.tonyvisconti.com/) in the new year. Dean was also
producing an album for [Jule Brown](https://web.archive.org/web/20051213+/http://www.myspace.com/julebrown) which is
a side project of Mark Holland of Jennyanykind.

Also 2005 saw a limited thearical release for [The Squid and The
Whale](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367089/combined) \- the Noah Baumbach film
that featured original music by Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips. A
[soundtrack
album](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AP2ZP8/aheadfullofwi-20) was
released that featured Dean performing the Pink Floyd track Hey You (as well
as lots of other cool music selected by Noah for the film soundtrack).

when the [Galaxie 500 Peel
Sessions](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BOH93Q/aheadfullofwi-20)
