<p><b>Luna and after Luna</b><br />Well that was a year - Luna finally called it a day with a series of dates at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City.

His guitar playing appeared in a series of (European) <span class="removed_link" title="http://eu.levi.com/index.jsp?lang=en&region=uk">Levi's commercials</span> that also featured an appearance from Britta.

Sean started pulling together plans for a solo album as well as filling time playing with NYC band <a href="http://www.elkcity.net/">Elk City</a></p>
<p>Britta, as well as her appearance in the aforementioned advert (and other work in advertising) has been working with Dean preparing their second album which will start recording with producer <a href="http://www.tonyvisconti.com/">Tony Visconti</a> in the new year. Dean was also producing an album for <a href="http://www.myspace.com/julebrown">Jule Brown</a> which is a side project of Mark Holland of Jennyanykind.</p>
