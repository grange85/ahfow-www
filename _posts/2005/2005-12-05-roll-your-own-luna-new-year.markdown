<p>Luna made a tradition of playing shows on New Year's Eve - and anyone who's seen in the new year with Luna will be aware that part of that tradition was a rendition of George McCrae's Rock Your Baby.</p>
<p>Just because there's no Luna and no new year show it doesn't mean you have to live without that tradition. A Head Full of Wishes gives you the opportunity to <a href="/2005/12/05/roll-your-own-luna-new-year/">roll your own Luna new year</a> with mp3s of Luna's performances.</p>
