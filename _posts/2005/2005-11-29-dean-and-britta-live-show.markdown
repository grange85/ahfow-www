Dean & Britta will be performing a **very short set** at a benefit for [Open
City](http://www.opencity.org) on Thursday, December 8, 6-9. At Paula Cooper
Gallery, 521 West 21st St, NYC

Tickets are available from $75 (includes a raffle ticket and a copy of the new
issue of Open City).

Ticket information from the Open City web site - apparently you have to book
by 1 December so get your act together

**NOTE the words**  
  short set  
  from $75  
Dean & Britta are not the main attraction so for that money you'd better be a
very big fan or interested in Open City (an Arts magazine)
