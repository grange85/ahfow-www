<p>Dean &amp; Britta will be performing a <b>very short set</b> at a benefit for <a href="http://www.opencity.org">Open City</a> on Thursday, December 8, 6-9. At Paula Cooper Gallery, 521 West 21st St, NYC</p>
<p>Tickets are available from $75 (includes a raffle ticket and a copy of the new issue of Open City).</p>
<p><span class="removed_link" title="http://www.opencity.org/benefit.html">Ticket information from the Open City web site</span> - apparently you have to book by 1 December so get your act together</p>
<p><b>NOTE the words</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;short set<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;from $75<br />Dean & Britta are not the main attraction so for that money you'd better be a very big fan or interested in Open City (an Arts magazine)</p>
