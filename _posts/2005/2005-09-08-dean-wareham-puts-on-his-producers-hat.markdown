Dean is currently in North Carolina producing an album for Jule Brown which is
Mark Holland of Jennyanykind's side project.

More details at the official and frighteningly ugly Jule Brown and
the thankfully much prettier [Sonicbids EPK
site](https://web.archive.org/web/20050908+/http://www.sonicbids.com/epk/epk.asp?epk_id=12932)

The Jule Brown official site is [now on
MySpace](https://web.archive.org/web/20050908+/http://www.myspace.com/julebrown) (thanks Mark)
