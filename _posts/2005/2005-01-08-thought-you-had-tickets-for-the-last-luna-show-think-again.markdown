<p>Luna, having sold out their final shows at The Bowery Ballroom on the 26th and 27th of February, have added a third date on the 28 February - tickets for this additional date will go on sale at noon on the 12 January.So if you'd made plans and commitments, taken time of work and booked your travel so you could see Luna's last show looks like you'll have to make MORE plans and shell out MORE money.</p>
