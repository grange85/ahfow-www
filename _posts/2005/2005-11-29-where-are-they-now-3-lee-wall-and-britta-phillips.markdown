OK - so we've not really lost touch with Britta thanks to the [Mailing
List](http://groups.google.com/group/fullofwishes) and the Dean & Britta
official [web site](https://web.archive.org/web/20051129+/http://www.deanandbritta.com) and
[forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20051129+/http://www.deanandbritta.com/forum/) but she did mention a bit of
extra curricular acrtivity that also involved Lee Wall

Britta appears in one of a series of adverts for Levi's jeans that are being
aired in Europe (including the UK). The rock guitar that accompanies these ads
has apparently been provided by the former drummer of Luna

You can check out the ads on the Levi's Europe web site
