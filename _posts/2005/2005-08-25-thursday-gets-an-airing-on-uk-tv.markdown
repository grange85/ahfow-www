Thursday, featuring the music of Luna, is getting an airing on Channel 4 in
the early hours of Saturday the 2 September.

The film stars Thomas Jane, Aaron Eckhart and Paulina Porizkova - sadly no
soundtrack saw the light of day so this is a chance to hear a couple of Luna
rarities

Set your videos for 02:20 on Saturday 2 September (that'll be Friday night
according to the TV guides!)
