This is a promo CD for Luna's The Days of Our Nights released by Elektra before they decided that they didn't want to release it at all.

Another CD that I'm not sure where it came from - pretty sure I didn't get this at the time, so someone sent it to me afterwards... if it was you, thanks!

This CD has {% ahfowtrack "Requiem for a Mouse" %}, that was dropped from the release version, and doesn't have {% ahfowtrack "Words Without Wrinkles" %} that replaced it (in a slightly different place). Requiem For a Mouse eventually turned up on the [Beggars Banquet Dear Diary single](/2024/07/11/my-record-collection-152-luna-dear-diary-sweet-child-o-mine-promo-cd/).

This isn't actually the first promo for the album that Elektra put out, shortly before a version was sent out with the title _The Young and The Restless_ that I first heard about back in 2012 when Brendan got in touch and sent me some photos of a cassette he had.

Jenell also sent me a picture of a CD version that is very similar to my CD but with the different title and, like the cassette version, was obviously before Elektra insisted on the inclusion of Sweet Child of Mine.

Jenell asked Dean about the CD:

<blockquote>
It’s pretty much the final mixes for the songs of the album, though a couple were changed. Our lawyer said that we’d be crazy to use that title on account of the soap opera by the same name. We later went with ‘Days of Our Nights’.
