This is my second copy of Tom Rapp's _comeback_ album from 1999, this is however the Blue Matter re-issue from 2022.

The album was produced by Damon and recorded at Damon & Naomi's Kali Studios and features both Damon and Naomi, 

The album has part of a painting by Welsh artist Frank Brangwyn, although I haven't managed to figure out which painting.
