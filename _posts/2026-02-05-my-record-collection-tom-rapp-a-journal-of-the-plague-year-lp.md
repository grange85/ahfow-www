This is my second copy of Tom Rapp's _comeback_ album from 1999, this is however the Blue Matter re-issue from 2022.

The album was produced by Damon and recorded at Damon & Naomi's Kali Studios and features both Damon and Naomi, 

The album has part of a painting by Welsh artist Frank Brangwyn, although I haven't managed to figure out which painting. We have a Brangwyn/LNER poster of Newcastle on our wall, but it's quite different from whatever is on the front of this album.

I just remembered that in my collection I also have a photocopied "supplement to A Journal of the Plague Year" which I guess must have come with the CD - although it's A4 and hasn't been folded... so maybe not it contains copies of newspaper articles and obituaries and a piece on Screaming Lord Sutch... to be honest I haven't quite figured it out!

The LP doesn't have the bonus track of Tom reciting 60s drug stories.
