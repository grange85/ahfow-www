Heads Down was the first release by Magic Hour and the single has one track split into _Part 1_ & _Part 2_ on each side of a seven inch single. It teases a song at the beginning but by the b-side is a gorgeously relentless torrent of noise.

I bought this on Discogs for two quid, including postage, back in 2012 which is quite a bargain! Actually I think you can still get [copies for peanuts on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/525802?ev=rb) or you can grab it, along with a hatful of Magic Hour obscurities on their [Magic Moments](https://magic-hour.bandcamp.com/album/magic-moments) collection.
