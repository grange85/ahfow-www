This is the CD version of Pup Tent that I bought on release.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/luna-pup-tent-cd-bb.jpg" "Luna - Pup Tent (CD)" %}

That photo on the back though... looks like the band are in a police line-up, and why wasn't Justin included in the "wear red" email? 

After Sterling Morrison on Bewitched and Tom Verlaine on Penthouse, Pup Tent's celebtrity guest star is Barrett Martic on Screaming Trees (and Tuatara) fame - he plays "marimba, vibes on 'Pup Tent and 'Beautiful View'" - I like that a drummer can't help but find instruments that need to be hit!

I have a [copy of the Elektra press release](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/02-luna/docs/pup-tent-press-release-ocr.pdf) (pdf) which is quite hilarious:

 - Dean's lyrics "combine surreal puns, fractured perspectives, dry-as-dust irony, jittery paranoia and heartfelt emotion"
 - Pup Tent has "lazy xylophone and marimba circles [that] spread like ripples across the surface"
 - City Kitty "reels with befuddled disgust"
 - Fuzzy Wuzzy has Luna "throwing off harmonic sparkles and ascending spiraling strings"

It must be an absolute hoot writing this nonsense!
