So, we arrive at the EIGHTH copy of _This Is Our Music_ in [this series](/category/my-record-collection)! When it turned up in the spreadsheet that is randomly feeding me items to post about I thought... _surely this is the last one?_ But no, there are (currently) two more copies left in the series. So, apparently, I have TEN copies of Galaxie 500's allegedly _weakest album_&dagger;!

This is actually another copy of the Rough Trade LP, can't actually figure out why I have two copies... well, actually **three** copies since the only difference between this and the CWNN LP is the sticker on the shrinkwrap and the postcards slid into the sleeve. But... two (or three) copies I have.

Periodically on the Galaxie 500 mailing list a discussion would kick off suggesting that Luna were better than Galaxie 500 which, as much as I love(d) Luna I was not willing to have any truck with - here's an exchange from 2004

<blockquote>
<b> > Michael</b>: ... I mean Luna is better than Galaxie 500.<br>
<b> > Me</b>: Last night I lay in bed listening to "This Is Our Music" so I'm afraid this morning I have to say that you are VERY wrong!<br>
<b> > Darren:</b> Luna is without question a far superior band to G500 in every way<br>
<b> > Me:</b> I honestly can't believe how anyone could listen to say "This Is Our Music" alone, in the dark (preferably loud) and not think that Galaxie 500 were the greatest thing EVER - I know I do...<br>
<b> > Camilla:</b> Every single time I listen to Galaxie 500 I think they are the greatest thing ever! I am totally in the Galaxie 500 is better than Luna camp. 
</blockquote>

I think it's significant that I decided to defend Galaxie 500's honour with what is supposed to be their weakest album - significant for two possible reasons:
 - Even if it is their weakest (which I'm inclined to dispute&Dagger;) it is NOT WEAK!
 - I'd choose to use their least highly regarded album to express just how effing great they were!

Obviously discussions like this were pointless, no one changed their mind (even Michael and Darren who were clearly wrong), but it was always fun, and only occasionally [degenrated into full on shouting](/2014/12/04/happy-20th-birthday-head-full-wishes-1/) 

_As you can tell, I'm struggling a bit - lord knows how I'm going to write about TWO more copies of this album!_

_&Dagger; I won't/can't answer the question 'what is the weakest Galaxie 500 album?'_
