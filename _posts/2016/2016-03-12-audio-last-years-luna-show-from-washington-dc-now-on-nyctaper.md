<p class="lead">The fab <a href="http://www.nyctaper.com/2016/03/luna-october-6-2015-930-club-washington-dc/">NYCTaper have just shared yet another show from Luna's reunion tour</a> of the US last October.</p>
<p>The show is another of kubacheck's recordings and is from the 9:30 Club in Washington DC on the 6 October. Here's how NYCTaper describe it:</p>
<blockquote>This DC show is notable for the minimal amount of stage banter and for a real workman-like but very strong run through the best material from the tour. For a topper, Luna came back out a second time for an encore and delivered a bit of a rarity — a sharp cover of Donovan’s "Season of the Witch".
