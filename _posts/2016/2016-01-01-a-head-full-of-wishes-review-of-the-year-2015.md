<p class="lead">It's been quite an eventful year for AHFoW, so here's a quick thrown together summary...</p>
<figure class="caption aligncenter"><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/16624996418/in/photolist-rk6seh-q7SXAW-qyRtAX-pqi1f1-pcxWRK-oGk4HU-nUEogW-nnSaAM-nnRGtn-nnSaHa-nEmske-nG8Pn6-nG8PxM-nEksAA-nCiJzC-dPWHcd-aU2TJV-nnSaVp-nnRGMi-niWSor-nmYjYW-egpvn3-efJyMv-dQekJ1-dPR77r-dPWH1m-dPR7a6-dPQFZn-dPR7kR-dPWH4o-dPWhUE-aYtga6-aYtfKF-aU2U5H-aU2TY2-aU2TRx-9GFEp6-9GqTu5-92XNmc-5SKhBT-5SPBw7-5SKho2-5SKhQz-5SKgF6-9LjPqH-9LjNR6-9GFEdk-9GJwH7-9GJwMY-9GFEik" title="New Damon & Naomi LP has arrived"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8744/16624996418_5b470e09ff_z.jpg" width="640" height="640" alt="New Damon & Naomi LP has arrived"></a><figcaption class="caption-text">New Damon & Naomi LP has arrived</figcaption></figure>
<p>On <strong>February</strong> 17th <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2015/02/17/damon-naomis-fortune-released-today/">Damon & Naomi released the beautiful soundtrack to Naomi's short film "Fortune"</a> - the album was the same number of tracks and exactly the same length as Nick Drake's masterpiece Pink Moon...</p>
<blockquote>
	When the CD was mastered I asked the mastering engineer to add and subtract some tiny spaces in the blanks to make sure that it's eleven tracks and exactly, to the tenth of a second, the length of Pink Moon.

</blockquote>
<p>... pressing delays meant that my vinyl copy never arrived until March!</p>

<p>Also in February the members of <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2015/02/09/another-luna-social-gathering/">Luna got together in Los Angeles for a social event</a> - it was also announced that the first reunion show would happen at The Echo in Los Angeles on the 13 April - tickets sold out almost instantly. It seems folk were ready for the reunion...</p>

<p>In <strong>March</strong> Dean dropped a hint that Luna's first five albums will be getting released in a vinyl box set... we're still waiting.</p>

<p>In <strong>April</strong> Damon & Naomi arrived in the UK for some dates to promote Fortune. <a href="http://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2015/04/10/damon-and-naomi-play-fortune-at-rough-trade-east/">London's show was a lunchtime affair at Rough Trade East</a>... here's me looking goofy and flying the flag... with Naomi</p>

<p class="lead">... and so on to 2016, which will finally see the release of teh Captured Tracks vinyl box set, more Luna dates in the US (and hopefully back to Europe - that's a hint for them and not stated with any knowledge). No word yet on Damon & Naomi's plans but I'm sure they'll be keeping busy.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining me on an eventful 2015 - hopefully 2016 will be as good!</p>
