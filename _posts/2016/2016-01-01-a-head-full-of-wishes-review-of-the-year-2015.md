<p class="lead">It's been quite an eventful year for AHFoW, so here's a quick thrown together summary...</p>
{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/flickr-downloads/16624996418_5b470e09ff_z.jpg" "New Damon & Naomi LP has arrived" "https://www.flickr.com/photos/grange85/16624996418/" %}
<p>On <strong>February</strong> 17th <a href="/2015/02/17/damon-naomis-fortune-released-today/">Damon & Naomi released the beautiful soundtrack to Naomi's short film "Fortune"</a> - the album was the same number of tracks and exactly the same length as Nick Drake's masterpiece Pink Moon...</p>
<blockquote>
	When the CD was mastered I asked the mastering engineer to add and subtract some tiny spaces in the blanks to make sure that it's eleven tracks and exactly, to the tenth of a second, the length of Pink Moon.

<p>... pressing delays meant that my vinyl copy never arrived until March!</p>

<p>Also in February the members of <a href="/2015/02/09/another-luna-social-gathering/">Luna got together in Los Angeles for a social event</a> - it was also announced that the first reunion show would happen at The Echo in Los Angeles on the 13 April - tickets sold out almost instantly. It seems folk were ready for the reunion...</p>


<p>In <strong>March</strong> Dean dropped a hint that Luna's first five albums will be getting released in a vinyl box set... we're still waiting.</p>

<p>In <strong>April</strong> Damon & Naomi arrived in the UK for some dates to promote Fortune. <a href="/2015/04/10/damon-and-naomi-play-fortune-at-rough-trade-east/">London's show was a lunchtime affair at Rough Trade East</a>... here's me looking goofy and flying the flag... with Naomi</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/126922416">There's a lovely video on Vimeo of The North Light</a>.</p>

<p>On the 13 April, <a href="/2015/04/14/lunas-reunion-show-a-quick-round-up-lunareunion/">Luna played their first show in over 10 years</a> in Los Angeles&hellip;</p>

<p>In <strong>June</strong> official word on the Luna vinyl box set arrived from Captured Tracks</p>
<p>In <strong>July</strong> and <strong>August</strong> the next leg of Luna's reunion kicked off with dates in the UK, all <a href="/authors/#joakim">beautifully documented for AHFoW by Joakim</a>.</p>
<p>Noah Baumbach's new <a href="/2015/08/26/mistress-america-round-up/">film Mistress America was out on general release</a> with a guest role for Dean as grumpy neighbour Harold, and an electronic soundtrack by Dean & Britta. The soundtrack was released on CD and <a href="/2015/11/30/dean-britta-mistress-america-soundtrack-vinyl-offer/">then vinyl later in the year</a>.</p>

<p><strong>September</strong> found Luna in Australia and then in New Zealand where they were joined on stage and on the beach by former bassist Justin Harwood.</p>

<p>In <strong>October</strong> Damon curated an exhibition <a href="http://ccva.fas.harvard.edu/damon-krukowski-not-be-played">NOT TO BE PLAYED</a>, and was also found up a ladder reading John Cage.</p>

<p>Luna's reunion tour arrived in the US, where for a couple of shows they played Penthouse from start to finish, and in Brooklyn they were <a href="/2015/10/10/stanley-demeski-guests-with-luna-in-brooklyn-last-night/">joined on stage by former drummer Stan Demeski</a>.</p>

<p>December found Damon & Naomi heading back out east for shows in Taiwan and Hong Kong</p>

<p>Meanwhile <a href="http://www.naomivision.com/videos#1">Naomi's videos for Waxahatchee and Meg Baird</a> found their way onto the internet.</p>
<p>Luna wrapped up the year with a New Year's Eve show in San Francisco... Rock Your Baby got it's traditional airing.</p>
<p class="lead">... and so on to 2016, which will finally see the release of the Captured Tracks vinyl box set, more Luna dates in the US (and hopefully back to Europe - that's a hint for them and not stated with any knowledge). No word yet on Damon & Naomi's plans but I'm sure they'll be keeping busy.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining me on an eventful 2015 - hopefully 2016 will be as good!</p>
