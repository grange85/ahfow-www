<p class="lead">Terry Tolkin is the A&R man who signed Luna to Elektra and anyone who's encountered him on Facebook knows that he has a hatful of amazing stories about the music industry that would make an amazing book.</p>

<div class="bg-info">
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>Terry has now updated his Kickstarter with an affordable option for those of us who aren't as rich as the rock stars! It now has a $25 starting pledge ... and this is a book that's needing to be written...</p>

<blockquote><p>I've added a couple of “Rewards" for the more Pavlovian sector of my potential backers.</p>
<p>I don't have the artwork yet but I've conjured up a jubilant Back Stage All EXCESS Pass/Bookmarker for donations on the $25 level. Immagonna print up a 100 of these. Then I'll come up with something else for that level of commitment.</p>
<p>I've got ONE First Edition copy of Michael Galinsky's “Malls Of America" photo book! It's signed by Michael and will include a one-off reproduction 8×10 print of Dean Wareham which will be signed by both Dean and Michael. Check out the latest edition of glamour magazine, “Dangerous Minds" for a gluttonous reprint/review of Michel's book. Look, I know we all poor and that you can currently purchase this book for $350 online. But c'mon, help a ni**a out! ;))</p>
<p>There's also an unlimited supply of $5000 Rewards. </p>
<p>Claim this Grand Puba if you DON'T want me to mention you in the book, K?</p>

<p>Well Terry has just <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/terrytolkin/america-on-a-thousand-dollars-a-day">launched a Kickstarter</a> with that very object in mind:</p>
<blockquote>i am going to write my autobiography. Its about an average music fan who fell upwards into becoming a major player in the music industry as an A&R man. Read the Wikipedia link that Ive already provided. Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll from the person who coined the term Alternative Music

<p>Currently you can either pledge $100 (or more) for a personally inscribed book, or just throw a few dollars to make it happen.</p>

<blockquote>With the funds raised here i will purchase a laptop, some recording equipment and a used car. I will travel the country to gather personal recollections from those whom I've interacted with and the impact it had on their lives and/or careers and peppered it with my own recollections as well. It's gonna be an interesting ride!<footer><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/terrytolkin/america-on-a-thousand-dollars-a-day">Terry Tolkin on his Kickstarter page</a></footer></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/terrytolkin/america-on-a-thousand-dollars-a-day">Head over to the Kickstarter page where you can pledge a bit of cash to help this happen</a>.</p>
