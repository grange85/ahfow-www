<p>For a little idleness in the run up to the end of the year I thought I'd just post some of my favourite cover versions of Galaxie 500 songs. Now, I love covers of Galaxie 500 songs - I pretty much love them all, even when they're not that great, because a band choosing to cover Galaxie 500 already endears me to them. The ones in this series might not be the best, and I'll certainly leave out covers I love more, but they are generally ones that when I hear them they make me feel good for all sorts of reasons.</p>

<p>Hefner were a band I sort of missed at the time - I knew of them, but somehow managed to have a completely erroneous idea of who they were and what they were like so I never gave them any of my time. Then, I heard them... when it was too late to get the full benefit of them.</p>

<p>Their cover of Oblivious is a sort of reminder of my carelessness - it's a beautiful cover, and with Darren's voice berating me for just how ridiculously misguided I was to ignore them. And, as if it hasn't sucked me in enough it has a gorgeous Formbyesque uke strum <sup>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</sup> in the close out.</p>

<p>Hefner split up shortly after I discovered that they weren't the band I thought they were but Darren has never stopped making reocrds, and is tirelessly imaginitive in his inspiration - from <a href="https://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/lido">outdoor swimming pools</a>, to <a href="https://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/track/little-squirrel-little-arrow">dogs in space</a>, from <a href="https://glassreservoir.bandcamp.com/album/wembley-eiffel-tower">London's failed Eiffel Tower</a> to his current project of music inspired by <a href="https://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/thankful-villages-volume-1">Thankful Villages</a>. All worth a listen and a few quid! As is so much of the <a href="https://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/">stuff he has on Bandcamp</a>.</p>

<p>The cover of Oblivious first appeared on Elefant's <a href="https://elefantrecordsclassics.bandcamp.com/album/snowstorm-a-tribute-to-galaxie-500">Snowstorm: A Tribute to Galaxie 500</a> - a splendid double CD tribute album that appeared in 2001 and was more recently released on the expanded edition of <a href="https://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/breaking-gods-heart-expanded-edition">Hefner's debut album Breaking God's Heart - which can be had for just a tenner</a> - forty songs, including this one for &pound;9.99!</p>

<p id="1">[1] - All uke strumming is Formbyesque btw - no matter how contemporary you try and make it all I see is <a href="https://youtu.be/VypRHitKnWk">sweet George strumming and gurning</a>.</p>
