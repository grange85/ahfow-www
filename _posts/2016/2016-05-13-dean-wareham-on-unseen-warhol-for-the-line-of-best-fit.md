<p class="lead">Dean Wareham has <a href="http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/reference-points/dean-wareham-on-the-unseen-films-of-andy-warhol">written about the <em>Exposed: Songs for unseen Warhol films</em> project for online magazine The Line of Best Fit</a>. The show, featuring Dean, Eleanor Friedberger, Tom Verlaine and Matin Rev comes to Europe next week with dates in Nantes,
</p>

<blockquote>For me this show is a like strange dream come true; I was given the title Guest Musical Curator and asked to come up with a list of performers. I first asked my musical heroes Tom Verlaine and Martin Rev (who made two of the most important albums of the late 20th century, Marquee Moon and Suicide respectively). I had met Eleanor Friedberger and Bradford Cox a few years ago at Primavera Sound (Eleanor on the bus going to the festival, Bradford on a bus leaving), and those were my next calls. Everyone said yes, just as I had. It feels like no one says no to working with Andy Warhol. If you score film, you count yourself lucky when you get to work with a great filmmaker, even if he’s not present to give direction.
