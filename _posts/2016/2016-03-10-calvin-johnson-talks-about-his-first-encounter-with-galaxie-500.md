We thought the music was quite calming, but the lyrics were on the verge of hysteria, and we liked that. He was singing about being a tugboat captain in a context that it felt as though you wanted to edge away from him very slowly so that you wouldn't want to alarm him in any way, and this we found very attractive - we liked it.
