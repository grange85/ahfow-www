<p>Back in 2004 I had the idea of doing a fan tribute album by folks on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List - it was a good plan, sadly it was poorly executed &hellip; over the next eighteen months the grand vision slowly (very, very slowly) fell apart - entirely due to my lack of any clue.</p>
<p>Lots of nice people had sent in recordings and after a shameful delay I finally burnt a bunch of CDRs, threw together a monochrome sleeve and sent copies out to anyone who wanted one. I have no idea how many - I just kept sending them out until folk stopped asking - and then I put it all on a website to download.</p>
<p>The album was a lovely mix from enthusiastic bedroom recordings, to full blown studio offerings; from straight covers to "interpretations". There were four Galaxie 500 tracks and nine Luna ones. And I love every single one of them.</p>
<p>At some point uring that eighteen months lead time, Ron Harrity offered to help out - and I shamefully never jumped at the offer - things would have been so much better if I had. Ron had been in a wonderful band called Nord Express, a few years earlier I'd been sent a tape of their stuff and had become a fan.</p>
<p>Ron had chosen to cover Cold Night - and it starts a gorgeous, gentle retelling of the Galaxie 500 song that builds beautifully and finished perfectly.</p>
