<p class="lead">I was almost certainly going to include <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lasligasmenores/">Las Ligas Menores</a>, there are a couple of clips on YouTube of them covering Strange - a charming, if a little rough, live version, and an acoustic cover.</p>
<p>But then, three posts into this series I got an email from bandcamp notifying me of <a href="https://lasligasmenores.bandcamp.com/album/ni-una-canci-n">Ni una canci√≥n a new release by Las Ligas Menores</a>. The three track release is "un simple adelanto de nuestro segundo LP" and the third track was called Fotos. I popped my headphones on at work and played it but got called away before I reached track three.</p>
<p>A few hours later I came across the page still waiting patiently in my browser to be finished and the word Galaxie in the album's description caught my eye. Why hadn't I noticed it before?</p>
<p>Fotos is, of course, a cover of Galaxie 500's Pictures - and a lovely Spanish language take on it.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://lasligasmenores.bandcamp.com/album/ni-una-canci-n">Bandcamp and buy a copy - it's lovely</a>!</p>
<p>Here they are performing it live a couple of days ago in Santiago, Chile.</p>

<p>&hellip; and here are the two versions of Strange:</p>
{% ahfowvideo "pUerOQDt2Hg" "Las Ligas Menores - Strange" %}
{% ahfowvideo "sPDzW1EEWDs" "Las Ligas Menores - Strange (acoustic)" %}
<p>So &hellip; just six songs into this series and already two bands from Argentina!</p>
