<p class="lead">This Wednesday night <a href="http://www.nbc.com/last-call-with-carson-daly">Last Call with Carson Daly</a> will be showing some more clips from Luna's show at the Teragram Ballroom in LA in October of last year.</p>
<p>The show goes out at 1:35 am (Pacific Time - that's technically the early hours of Thursday morning) and will feature the band playing {% track "Bewitched" %} and {% track "23 Minutes in Brussels" %}</p>
<p><a href="/2015/11/04/video-luna-on-last-call-with-carson-daly/">Head over here to see them playing Malibu Love Nest and Friendly Advice</a> last time they were on the show back in November.</p>
