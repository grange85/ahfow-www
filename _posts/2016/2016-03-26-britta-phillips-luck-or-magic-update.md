<p class="lead">It's been just over a month since <a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/brittaphillips/">Britta announced her debut album on Pledgemusic</a> and she's been treating all the folk who've pre-ordered with a stack of updates.</p>

<p>The Pledgemusic store is packed with goodies including signed test pressings, t-shirts, rare vinyl, Luna posters, and handwritten lyric sheets - as well as, of course, CD and vinyl copies of the album itself - and with all the extras being posted (see below) you'd be silly not to <a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/brittaphillips/exclusives">head over to Pledgemusic and order something</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/blog/britta-phillips-interview">check out this nice Q&A with Britta</a>.</p>

<p>If you haven't put your order in you've been missing out on posts:</p>
<p>&hellip; about the recording process&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
	Then Dean played guitar on 3 more songs – we kept his original guitars on "Landslide" and "Fallin' In Love." I kept my original demo guitars on the 4 songs I play on. I especially like what I played on the song "Luck or Magic," but I’m not really a guitar player&hellip;
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; stacks of downloads of full tracks, demos, snippets etc. Including both sides of teh Fallin' In Love/Hey Paula single; a couple of Jem era tracks; early demos of her cover of Drive (The Cars)</p>

<p>&hellip; and some lovely little video clips!</p>

<p>The cover of Drive is the 2nd single from the album and is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/drive/id1072803111?i=1072803122">available on iTunes</a> if you prefer to work that way. It also has a video directed by <a href="http://www.theculturecrush.com/">Debra Scherer of The Culture Crush</a></p>
