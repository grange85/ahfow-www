<p class="lead">On the back of last weeks pay-what-you-want release of an <a href="https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/spirit-of-love-b-sides-bonuses-and-soundtracks">album of rarities</a>, Damon & Naomi have now made the <a href="https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/">rest of their bandcamp catalogue available for whatever you feel it's worth</a>.</p>
<p>After the release of Spirit of Love Damon tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/dada_drummer/status/805064393075687424">"So this album we posted for free now has not only the most downloads, but the most PAID downloads for us"</a> so it comes as little surprise to find that this morning all of the Damon & Naomi releases on bandcamp have had their prices set to "name your price".</p>
<p>Lots of gems here including their fantastic debut album <a href="https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/more-sad-hits">More Sad Hits</a>, the <a href="https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/the-sub-pop-years-1995-2002">Sub Pop Years</a> compilation and the masterpiece that is <a href="https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/damon-naomi-with-ghost">Damon & Naomi with Ghost</a> (and <a href="https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/">lots more just as good</a>!) - all worth a few pennies if not more!</p>
