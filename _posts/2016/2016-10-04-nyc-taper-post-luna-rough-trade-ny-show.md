<p class="lead">The always remarkable <a href="http://www.nyctaper.com/2016/10/luna-october-1-2016-rough-trade/">NYC Taper has just posted his recording of Saturday night's Luna show</a> at Rough Trade NY.</p>

<blockquote>The Saturday show began in earnest with 23 Minutes in Brussels, a lengthy song with a propelled instrumental segment that usually works as a show-stopping number. From the outset it was clear that this was going to be no ordinary night.
