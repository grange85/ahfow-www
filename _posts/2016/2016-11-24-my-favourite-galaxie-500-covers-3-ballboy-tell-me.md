<p>I adore ballboy and Gordon (of ballboy) has an oft-stated his love of Galaxie 500. This cover of Tell Me is from <a href="https://ballboy.bandcamp.com/album/the-sash-my-father-wore-and-other-stories">The Sash My Father Wore and Other Stories</a> which is the ballboy album that's pretty much just Gordon. And it's a beauty.</p>

<p>I saw Gordon play a solo gig in Wimbledon library about the time of this release - he didn't play Tell Me - he said he couldn't because his version was all about the cello. He wasn't wrong - Tell Me is a beautiful song, and Gordon's almost angelic delivery of the lyric is a joy - but the cover <b>is</b> all about the cello. I'm glad he didn't play it. The gig was a joy but Tell Me had no place there.</p>
