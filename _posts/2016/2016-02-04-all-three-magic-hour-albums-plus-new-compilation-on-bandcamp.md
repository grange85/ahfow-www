<p class="lead">Magic Hour's three albums and a new compilation have just <a href="https://magic-hour.bandcamp.com">been released on bandcamp and you can buy all four albums for less than $25</a>.</p>
<p>In 1993 Damon & Naomi were invited by Wayne Rogers and Kate Biggar of Crystalized Movements to be part of their new project Magic Hour, over the course of the next four years the band released three tremendous albums of psychedelic rock/folk music before going their separate ways after playing at the first Terrastock Festival in 1997.</p>
