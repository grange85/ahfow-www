<p class="lead">Here's some pictures, a couple of videos, and some hasty words about Luna's show in Paris last Wednesday.</p>

<p>Petit Bain is a boat moored on the Seine - I'm not sure I've ever been to a gig on a boat before (although Dean mentioned Luna having played at least two previously) - and to be honest once you were inside you'd have been hard pushed to know you were on a boat at all. The space was big and I certainly didn't notice any rocking and rolling of the other sort.</p>

<p>After failing to manage to organise a pre-meet for this show we arrived at the venue to find the first act finishing, and the venue already pretty packed - I fought my way to the front and said "hi" to Ulrika before moving back to the merch stand to have a quick chat with Britta who was selling the Ts an CDs.</p>

<p>I moved forward again and found a decent spot on a raised area to the left of the stage before second support act Matt Elliot started. Under normal circumstances I might have found somewhere else to be during his set but the spot was good enough to hang onto.</p>

<p>Managed to be found by both Franck and Michael before Luna started but it was too crowded to track down any of the folk I hadn't previously met but said they were going to be there.</p>

<p>Another splendid Penthouse set was followed by a couple of sizeable encores including Sean doing {% ahfowtrack "Still at Home" %}, plus {% ahfowtrack "Malibu Love Nest" %}, {% ahfowtrack "Bewitched" %}, {% ahfowtrack "Tiger Lily" %}, {% ahfowtrack "Ceremony" %} and {% ahfowtrack "Indian Summer" %}</p>

<p>Gig finished and the staff were too keen to kick us out of the venue so still no chance top catch up with folk, so after a rather 'adventurous' route to a Metro station on the other side of the river we made our way back to our rooms.</p>
