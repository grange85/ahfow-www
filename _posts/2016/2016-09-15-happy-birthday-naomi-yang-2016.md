Damon & Naomi are currently touring in China which means I'm rattling this post off while it's still Naomi's birthday where she is!

It's well worth following <a href="https://www.instagram.com/naomivision/">Naomi's Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dada_drummer">Damon's Twitter</a> for details of their Chinese sojourn.

Have a lovely day Naomi!
