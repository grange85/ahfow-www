<p>So I kicked off this series without really thinking it through - I set two stupidly arbitrary rules for myself<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> ~ the second one was not to over-mine the rich seam that the two tribute albums provided. This meant I had to pick from them for reasons that might seem a little&hellip; unfair.</p>

<p><a href="https://theblogthatcelebratesitself.bandcamp.com/album/va-blue-thunder-a-tribute-to-galaxie-500">Blue Thunder, a Tribute to Galaxie 500</a> was released earlier this year with some gems - and when I started this series I had no idea which track (or tracks) I'd pick from it.</p>

<p>Then this happened:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/grange85">@grange85</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ahfow">@ahfow</a> nudge nudge <a href="https://t.co/3f2cv6cJQN">https://t.co/3f2cv6cJQN</a> ðŸ˜‰</p>&mdash; Half (@herelieshalf) <a href="https://twitter.com/herelieshalf/status/797147773447663620">November 11, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Who knows? I might have picked it anyway - it starts with a lovely organ has some nice programmed percussion and a pedal steel all of which might easily have been enough to get them in here - but I'll admin that the tweet was definitely the clincher!</p>
