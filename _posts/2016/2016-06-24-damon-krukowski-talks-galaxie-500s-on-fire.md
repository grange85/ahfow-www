<p class="lead">Damon has written up <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/06/24/galaxie-500-interview/">some thoughts on Galaxie 500's masterpiece, On Fire</a>, for today's bandcamp daily&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>Along the way, there are enough surprises thrown in that I'm still taken aback—the nutty schoolyard “nah-nah-nah's” behind the backwards solo in "Another Day," the lead guitar entering on top of the second vocal verse in “Plastic Bird,” even some of my own drum fills give me a start (did I mean to play that, or did it just happen?). And through it all, Naomi's bass, sounding so grand and melancholy.
