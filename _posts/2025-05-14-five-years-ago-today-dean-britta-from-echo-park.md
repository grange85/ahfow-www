On this day in 2020, a few months into that awful year of staying in and seeing no one, Dean & Britta played their first full live streamed show from their living room in Echo Park, LA and made things a little better! I wrote about their live stream shows on Substack this week - you can [read it here](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/from-the-archive-dean-and-brittas), and I've popped the whole live stream onto YouTube.
