I don't have many recordings of Damon & Naomi but this recording was made by my taping pal Andy who recorded quite a few shows with/for me around that time, I gave the recording its name because at the beginning of Damon & Naomi's set Damon calls out _"attention shoppers"_ in an attempt to attract the attention of the noisy patrons at the bar.

This was a great show, support had come from The Clientele (first or second time I'd seen them) and The Trembling Blue Stars (sadly neither of their sets were taped). Damon & Naomi were over with Michio Kurihara on the tour that would end with the "Live in San Sebasitan" deception (go read your Sub Pop Years liner notes).

I didn't often bother making sleeves for the recordings I have, but I did for this one. The show dates from a good ten years before my first phone with a camera and since I rarely took a _proper_ camera to shows the picture I used for the cover was not one of mine. A couple of weeks after the London show D&N played in Utrecht in Holland and the pictures from that show by the photographer Stefan Claudius were sent to me to include on AHFoW. I didn't get permission to bung it on my CD sleeve but then it was never meant for sharing. Stefan's photos also turned up in the "Song to the Siren" CD booklet.

The sleeve is obviously a riff on the sleeve of the recently released [Damon & Naomi with Ghost](/2023/10/02/my-record-collection-074-damon-naomi-with-ghost-cd/) which also seems to have been the inspiration, ten years later, for the Great Pop Supplement [Walking Backwards single](/2025/02/13/my-record-collection-damon-naomi-walking-backwards-worlds-strongest/).

I eventually did share the recording, and the sleeve, a few years later... and now I've just popped it on YouTube...

Listening back now I'm rather taken with how much more boisterous the audience seem to be than they have been at more recent Damon & Naomi shows - is that because we're all (band and audience) now 24 years older? It really was a cracking show and I'm glad I dragged Andy and his DAT machine along!

Some video from this show turned up on the DVD that was released with Song to The Siren in 2002:
