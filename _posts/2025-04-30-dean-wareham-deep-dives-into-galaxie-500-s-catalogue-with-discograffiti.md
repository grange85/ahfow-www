The Discograffiti podcast is doing a deep dive into Galaxie 500's recorded output with Dean Wareham and has [just released a "director's cut" version](https://www.patreon.com/posts/205-directors-of-127763127) of the first episode for Patreon supporters - you can also buy it as a one off for $3.

The first episode concentrates on Today (although starts with the demo tape and the early unreleased tracks), and it's great to hear Dean being confronted with Galaxie 500's past and fantastic to hear that the host Dave has really done is homework (and is clearly a fan too).

<blockquote>
For my money, Galaxie 500 was the greatest dream pop group that ever existed.  And Dean’s Discograffiti appearance couldn’t possibly be better timed: his brand-new solo LP, That’s The Price Of Loving Me—his best work since 1990 imho—marks the first time he and producer Kramer have collaborated since that very year, after the latter had doused Galaxie 500’s perfect triumvirate of albums in his trademark reverb bath.

The podcast will be [released to the general public](https://discograffiti.com/) on Friday (2nd May) but if you can run to the cost of a cup of coffee it's well worth throwing $3 at the "director's cut" that's available to buy on Patreon and apparently has 17 minutes more!

The second episode covering On Fire will be released next week, and I guess the This Is Our Music episode the following week.
