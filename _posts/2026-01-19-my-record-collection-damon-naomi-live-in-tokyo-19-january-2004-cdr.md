This is a CDR that has a few live selections from a Damon & Naomi show in Japan in 2004 that was released on a limited edition numbered CDR through Damon & Naomi's website.

Sadly, this has gone the way of certain CDRs and has decided to become unplayable on any of my many CD options around the house. Fortunately I did rip it back when it did work - and it probably hasn't been out of its envelope too many times since then so how these things degrade despite not being played is a bit of a mystery!

The album contains five tracks with 1.5 Damon & Naomi originals and 3.5 covers, and has Damon & Naomi accompanied by Kurihara (of course) on guitar, and by Taisha Takizawa on flute, an instrument that deserves more attention from the world of rock music!

The CD is in a PVC envelope with a paper insert that is numbered - mine is 015 of 100.
