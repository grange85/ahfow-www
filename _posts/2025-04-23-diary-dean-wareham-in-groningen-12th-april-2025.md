The last of the three shows I was attending on this tour turned out to be in Groningen in The Netherlands, but that hadn't been the original plan. We had intended to see the show in Hamburg and had booked our ferries and trains to get there and then DB started sending me multiple emails saying that the trains would be disrupted, but weren't very helpful in explaining just how disrupted and whether we would be able to make all our connections. So rather than struggle our way across Europe we decided to see the show a day earlier in Groningen.

The route to Groningen was more complicated than getting to Glasgow and Leeds, but still fairly straightforward:

- Metro to Meadow Well and a 20 minute walk to the ferry terminal at North Shields
- Overnight ferry from North Shields to Ijmuiden
- Uber from Ijmuiden to Sloterdijk
- Bus from Sloterdijk to Groningen
