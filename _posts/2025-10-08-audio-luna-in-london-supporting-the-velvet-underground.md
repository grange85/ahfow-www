Whilst going through my cassettes preparing the next few posts for the [my record collection](/category/my-record-collection/) series of posts I came across a recording that I had both forgotten I had, and had never digitised. This is an audience recording of Luna's set at The Forum in London while on tour with The Velvet Underground.

I've digitised the show and am [currently seeding it on bittorrent site Dimeadozen](http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=802307) (you need to be registered, and to have a bittorrent client, to download it).

It's a fair recording of the show, given that it's of a support act in a large venue. As a taster, here are Luna playing Slash Your Tires:

Dean wrote about the show in his tour diary:

<blockquote>
Tonight’s show is at the Forum in London, capacity of about 1800. Lots of celebrities, like Chrissie Hynde and Peter Gabriel. Wow. I was hoping for Mick Ronson. The Velvets do a killer version of “Hey Mr. Rain” which must be about twelve minutes long. They’re also doing a new song in the encores, “Coyote.” After the show, we go back to the Columbia Hotel and sit in the bar.

I'll be writing about the tape, and I guess the show, in the series in a few weeks time and will share it again then, in the meantime, go grab it from DIME.

I've previously shared my recording of the [headline show that Luna played a couple of days earlier](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2024/09/12/my-record-collection-170-luna-live-at-the-borderline-london-in-1993/).
