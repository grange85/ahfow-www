This copy of Luna's Bonnie and Clyde is another collection filler since my first copy was the [CD version I've already posted about](/2023/12/07/my-record-collection-093-luna-bonnie-clyde-chinatown-cd/). 

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/luna-bonnie-and-clyde-chinatown-12.jpg" "Luna - Bonnie and Clyde 12&quot;" %}

The 12" has the same four tracks as the CD with the Bonnie Parker version of Bonnie and Clyde sharing the A side with {% ahfowtrack "Thank You For Sending Me An Angel" %}, and the Clyde Barrow version following {% ahfowtrack "Chinatown" %} on the B side. Although, probably rightly, the single doesn't declare an A or a B side unless you hold it at a certain angle and inspect what is etched into the run-out-grooves.

In my earlier post I [linked to a survey](https://forms.gle/ZBNfxqc7CZqvoZEC9) to see which version of {% ahfowtrack "Bonnie and Clyde" %} the massed followers of AHFoW preferred - the nine responses declared that the Bonnie Parker (slow) version was preferred by two to one! The survey is [still open](https://forms.gle/ZBNfxqc7CZqvoZEC9) if you want to set the record straight.
