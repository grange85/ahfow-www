Surprisingly this is the third (of four) entries for Luna's Dear Paulina and while it was one of the most thrilling adventures in the history of A Head Full of Wishes, I have written about it on this web site ad nausea... so I'll keep this one brief.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/luna-dear-paulina-sleeveless-copies.jpg" "Luna - Dear Paulina (sleeveless x 4)" %}

I ordered 500 copies of Dear Paulina, and then ordered 500 sleeves, and 500 polythene bags. 546 copies of the single arrived, so 46 copies arrived without a sleeve. After the ones with picture sleeves had sold I off-loaded a few of the sleeveless ones for a discount but I still have a few copies that I hung onto. I had considered doing some photo-copied sleeves and seeing what I could sell them for, but never got around to it.

Mint copies of the single with sleeves sell for about £20 to £40 on Discogs (one of the very few test pressings I gave away sold for £50).

The last copies I sold were in 2008 when I came across a few with picture sleeves, but no insert - I sold them for £3 (incl postage) in the UK and $6 (incl postage) everywhere else - which was pretty much what they had sold for in 1999. As you can see, I'm no business man! I still haven't made back my money! Although they were sold to folk on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List so hopefully they got into the hands of fans rather than flippers.

The full story, and mp3 downloads, can be found in my [Lost tracks: Luna - Dear Paulina](/2009/07/11/mp3-lost-tracks-6-luna-dear-paulina/) post from 16 years ago!
