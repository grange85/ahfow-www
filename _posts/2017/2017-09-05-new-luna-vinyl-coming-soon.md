<p class="lead">Feral Child Records will be shortly releasing two Luna 7" singles. The first is <a href="https://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/luna/releases/luna-california-blue-rock-yr-baby/">a cover of Roy Orbison's California Blue</a> and the second is <a href="https://db.fullofwishes.co.uk/luna/releases/luna-lonesome-cowboy-bill/">a split single with Cheval Sombre</a> and is a cover of The Velvet Underground's Lonesome Cowboy Bill.</p>
<p>Feral Child appear to be a little shy of the Internet so the best place to watch for news of these releases is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/greatpopsupplement/">Great Pop Supplement Facebook page</a>.</p>
<blockquote>they don't really "do" the internet, they are a quiet couple who live off the land so to speak. They bake bread, eat lebanese food and keep goats, a donkey and some chickens but always wanted to release some records. They are conducting an experiment whereby you can sell out entire runs of records without having a website or indulging in any social media. fair play to them i say!

<p>The b-side of California Blue is Luna's New Year's Eve favourite, George McRae's Rock Yr Baby.</p>
<p>Both singles will be limnited to 500 copies.</p>
