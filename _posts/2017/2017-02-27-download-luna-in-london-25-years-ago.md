<p>In 1991 Galaxie 500 split. I was heartbroken, and a little baffled. I had no idea of the ins and outs - I only became aware of the true sadness of the split many years later - but the brief Melody Maker news item was sad enough and hinted that things were not amicable. </p>

<p>A month or so later Damon & Naomi released the Pierre Etoile 12&rdquo; and some time after that Dean's Anesthesia 12&rdquo; arrived - and both started to put my mind at ease. While Galaxie 500 were no more - all three still had something special to offer.</p>

<p>On 27 February 1992 Luna played in London at the Underworld (a room in the basement of the World's End pub in Camden). Ken and Graham and myself went along. Arriving with a little trepidation, unsure of what Dean had to offer, and unsure if folk would turn out to see.</p>

<p>Now, not many shows stick in my head as clearly as this one - this is what I remember of the evening:</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the support bands doled out free 7‚Äù singles - not their own, but some they'd obviously picked up in bulk in a second-hand shop somewhere.</li>
<li>One of the support bands (Winterset) had, I think, Gina Morris, journalist and one-time Stereolab member, guest on a track.</li>
<li>I had recently acquired a Sony Walkman Pro and this was the first show I taped with it - set-up all wrong, the recording was awful - except for the encore after I fiddled with the settings.</li>
<li>Grasshopper of Mercury Rev played guitar (this was before Sean joined the band)</li>
<li>Luna played Beat Happening's Indian Summer - I was unaware that Dean had a little history with the song so it came as a pleasant surprise!</li>
<li>Two Galaxie 500 songs!</li>
<li>I left reassured that things looked like they were going to be just fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had my recording of the show, but rarely listened to it - it was sadly hard on the ears - I put Temperature's Rising (from the encore) online but apart from that it was left to my surprisingly full memory to keep the magic of that evening alive.</p>

<p>Luckily, it turns out I wasn't the only person recording the show, and one of the other recordings has <a href="http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=585083">recently been shared on DIMEADOZEN</a> and sounds so much better than mine.</p>

<p>So today is the 25th anniversary of that show - so why don't you <a href="http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=585083">head over to DIME grab it</a> and have a listen to LUNA in their very early days, see how they hit the ground running!</p>

<p>Here's my recording of Temperature's Rising while you wait for Joe's superior recording to download!</p>
