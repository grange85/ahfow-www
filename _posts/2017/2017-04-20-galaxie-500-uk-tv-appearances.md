<p class="lead">A video of Galaxie 500 being interviewed on UK telly promoting On Fire has just turned up on YouTube, this goes alongside other UK appearances that have been around for a while&hellip;</p>

<p>This tells us two things&hellip;</p>
<ul>
	<li>The UK really did love Galaxie 500!</li>
	<li>Music on telly was so much better back then, can you imagine Galaxie 500 getting on national TV now!?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, enough of me moaning - enjoy the clips:</p>

<blockquote>They're so eclectic they even dip into the perplexing oevre of that former professional avant-gardist turned professional rock widow Yoko Ono for a version of the very deep Listen, the Snow Is Falling, how evocative, how meaningful, how to say&hellip; Rapido</blockquote>

<blockquote>Not much variation, sometimes it's verse, verse chorus sometimes it's verse, chorus, verse, chorus</blockquote>
<blockquote>They never write in an American review 'this is a great pop song', that's like an oxymoron</blockquote>
