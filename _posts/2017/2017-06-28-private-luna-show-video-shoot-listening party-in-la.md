<p>Luna will be playing a private show, hosting an LP listening party and filming the video for their cover of The Cure's Fire in Cairo in Los Angeles on July 11th - and you could be there!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/luna2/updates/85849">Tickets for the show</a> are only available on the band's Pledgemusic site and as of right now there are 62 tickets left.</p>
<p>Sounds like a must if you're in the area!</p>
