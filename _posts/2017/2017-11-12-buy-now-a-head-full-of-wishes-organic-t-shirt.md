<p class="lead">Now available to order is this lovely <em>organic cotton</em> A Head Full of Wishes T-shirt featuring the "earring" design used on the long sold out Everything's Swirling fanzine.</p>

<p>I have printed 50 shirts in "unisex" size from <del>S</del> M to <del>XXL</del> XL (but the extremes are limited so best be quick if you want one of those) - orders will be first come ~ first served.</p>

<p>All shirts will also come with a badge (in one of two random designs) and a fancy recylced cotton card (in one of three random designs).</p>

<h2>Prices</h2>

<p>I'm not setting up a PayPal "shop" like last time because it was bothersome and confusing so&hellip;</p>

<p>Check out how much you need to pay using the table below and then use PayPal to send money to andy@grange85.co.uk - in the comments please say:</p>

<ul><li>what size you want  - <del>S /</del> M / L / XL <del>/ XXL</del></li>
<li>your postal address (even if you think PayPal knows it!!)</li></ul>

</table>

<p class="bg-danger">Don't forget to include the size you want <strong>and</strong> your address!</p>


<p>For now I'm going with only one per person (unless there are special circumstances (e.g. two of you in the same household who both want one) in which case <a href="mailto:andy@grange85.co.uk">give me a shout</a>!)</p>
