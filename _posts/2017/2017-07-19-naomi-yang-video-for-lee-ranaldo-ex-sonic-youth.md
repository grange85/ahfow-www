<p class="lead">Naomi's latest work in her <a href="http://www.naomivision.com">other career as a film-maker</a> is a lovely video for Lee Ranaldo.</p>
{% ahfowvideo "V2HWSUaqPd4" "Lee Ranaldo - New Thing (dir: Naomi Yang)" %}
<blockquote>I&apos;ve described &lsquo;New Thing&rsquo; as &lsquo;my song about the Internet&rsquo; â€” about our thousands of &lsquo;friends&rsquo; and the obsession with accumulating &lsquo;likes.&rsquo; When Naomi and I began discussing ideas for the video we knew we wanted to reference that subject matter but didn&apos;t want to do so in any heavy-handed way. I told her I&apos;d like to be a character of some sort rather than &lsquo;guy singing with guitar&rsquo; and she found &lsquo;Buster,&rsquo; as we dubbed the JVC 3100R &lsquo;Television/Radio Pyramid Capsule Unit&rsquo; on eBay. You wouldn&apos;t believe what a cool old useless piece of outdated technology like that sells for these days!
