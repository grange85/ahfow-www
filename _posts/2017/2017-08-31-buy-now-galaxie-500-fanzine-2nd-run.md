<p class="lead">The second run of the fanzine is now available to order. This is limited to 50 copies (so there'll have been 150 copies altogether (OK&hellip; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BX_IZ0Ggxmr/?taken-by=grange85">15<strong>1</strong> to be accurate/honest</a>!)) - when these are gone there'll be no more so grab them while you can!</p>


<p>The 32 page booklet includes articles, photographs, art and memorabilia created by fans from around the world. It comes with a numbered, hand-printed, and hand-stamped sleeve, and will include a badge (button) and a high quality photograph of the band in either London in 1989 or Frankfurt in 1990.</p>
