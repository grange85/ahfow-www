<p class="lead">On the 29th August 1987 Galaxie 500 played their first ever show in a flat in New York City. Everything's Swirling is a limited edition fanzine to celebrate the 30th anniversary of this event.</p>

<p>The 32 page booklet is limited to 100 copies and includes articles, photographs, art and memorabilia by fans from all over the world. It will come with a numbered, hand printed, and hand-stamped sleeve, and will include a badge (button) and a high quality photograph of the band in either London in 1989 or Frankfurt in 1990 (most 15cm x 10cm but a few random issues will have larger 21cm x 14cm photos)</p>
<h3>Ordering information</h3>
<div class="text-muted">
<p>Orders will be limited to one copy per person, prices are in UK&pound; so that I can keep track of sales, and will cost (including postage):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UK</strong>: &pound;5</li>
<li><strong>EU</strong>: &pound;7 (currently &euro;7.67)</li>
<li><strong>Rest of the world (incl US)</strong>: &pound;8 (currently US$10.31 or AUS$13)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=currency+converter">Google should be able to tell you</a> how much that will be in your local currency.</p>
<p>Sorry it's a wee bit pricier than I'd have liked but postage and not making too much of a loss were mitigating factors!</p>

<div class="text-danger">
<p>The fanzine is now all <strong>sold out</strong> - thanks so much to everyone who bought one - I am utterly overwhelmed! Most have been posted out and the rest will be on their way on Monday - please feel free to say nice things and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BX87C_BFKCb/">Tweet of Instagram pictures of you reading and thumbs-upping</a> when they arrive (and wear those badges with pride)!</p>
<p>Sorry if you missed out - you'll just have to be extra quick on the button in ten years time for the 40th anniversary fanzine!</p>
