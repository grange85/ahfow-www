<p class="lead">So, come the end of May, Galaxie 500 will reach the grand old age of 30 which seems an appropriate cause for a fan celebration and I thought it would be nice if that celebration had some fan-focussed physical manifestation - and I guess the standard form for that would be a fanzine.</p>
<p>For that I need contributions, that could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Words (reviews, opinions, memories, poems, etc.)</li>
<li>Pictures (art, photography, etc.)</li>
<li>Ideas</li>
<li>Offers of help with design/layout/distribution etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's probably fairly clear that this idea can currently be filed in the "half-baked" category but I'd like to think there's enough of us, and enough love, to pull this off.</p>
<p>I have to admit, at this point, that the idea wasn't original and is ripping off this <a href="http://foxtrotecholimatango.blogspot.co.uk/">lovely Felt fanzine</a> from a few years ago - that took a year and was very classy - we have less than three months so our ambition should probably be scaled appropriately.</p>
<p>Please <a href="/about/">get in touch</a> if you can offer any of the above, or anything else to help make this happen.</p>
