<p class="lead">Damon has taken the themes that he explored in his <a href="http://amzn.to/2wfGcOw">book The New Analog</a> and has developed them into a new six-part podcast series that launches today as part of the <a href="https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/showcase">new Radiotopia series Showcase</a>.</p>
<p>In the first episode Damon ponders the differences between digital and analog time and how "machines have a different sense of time".</p>
<p>You can find out more about the series and listen to (or subscribe to) the first episode over at the <a href="https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/showcase">Showcase web site</a>.</p>
<p>The first episode was also previewed as part of the excellent <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/ways-of-hearing/">99% Invisible podcast</a> earlier in the week.</p>
