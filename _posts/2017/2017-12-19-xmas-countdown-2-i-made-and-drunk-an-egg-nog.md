<p class="lead"> I've never had an egg nog. To me Egg Nog is primarily a Luna tune, and secondarily some strange unknown seasonal beverage. This year I decided to make an egg nog! You can catch most of my egg-nogging as an Instagram story for the next 24 hours! Or just stay here, look at a couple of photos and listen to the aforementioned Luna gem.</p>

<p>After some egg nog research I opted to follow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/dec/11/how-to-make-perfect-eggnog-recipe">the recipe Felicity Cloake posted to The Guardian</a> - to be honest whenever I make almost anything I've never made before Felicity's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-cook-the-perfect">How to make the perfect&hellip;</a> series is invariably where I end up.</p>

<p>I made half the quantity, because there's only three of us, and one of us (me) almost never drinks! And Felicity's recipe had a lot of booze in it - a mix of rum and madeira. Also lots of cream, lots of sugar &hellip; and of course eggs.</p>

<p>It's dead easy to make and is a beautiful, thick, creamy concoction and one ladleful has me feeling quite light-headed. Hazel's done her best to get through some but there's still a jug of it in the fridge!</p>
