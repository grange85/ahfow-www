Luna's Romantica was originally only released on CD and this was its first vinyl release that was put out alongside Rendezvous for Record Store Day in April 2012, which was pretty close to the album's 10th birthday.

So... another RSD release I didn't have to queue up for - Dean sent me this copy, signed by him and Britta, and, as the [RSD Penthouse](/2023/03/20/my-record-collection-018-luna-penthouse-deluxe-2xlp/) had done five years later, it actually arrived _on RSD_ - when I thanked Dean I pointed out that I had been looking at photos of queues outside record shops when the postie knocked.

The album was released in a run of a 1000 copies, and Dean mentioned that they maybe should have pressed more. They finally did give it [another release in a Pledgemusic campaign](/2023/01/30/my-record-collection-004-luna-romantica-lp/) four years later.

This release was in black vinyl whereas the Pledge version was clear, which means it looks like [I cheated and was playing _this_ version](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/romantica-lp.jpg) when I posted about the Pledge copy, and had the Pledge copy, still in its sleeve, propped behind. I can't think why I'd have done that - and why none of you noticed the deception!?
