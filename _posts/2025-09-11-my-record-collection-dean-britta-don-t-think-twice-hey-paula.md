This is a single that is nominally a split with the a side having a cover of {% ahfowtrack "Don't Think Twice It's Alright" %} credited to Britta and the aa side has {% ahfowtrack "Hey Paula" %} credited to Dean. It was released on Great Pop Supplement in 2015.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/dean-and-britta-dont-think-twice-hey-paula-86.jpg" "Britta and Dean - Don't Think Twice / Hey Paula" %}

While I'm happy to accept that Don't Think Twice is a Britta release, to credit Hey Paula, a song that is a man/woman duet, just to Dean is a bit of an odd stretch! It was later [released on an ACLU benefit album](https://gezelligrecords.bandcamp.com/album/is-there-another-language) credited more appropriately to Dean & Britta.

Is it just me or does Britta's voice on the Dylan cover sound like it was recorded after a full packet of fags? It is certainly... gruffer than on most of her other recordings.

Before Heavy Metal and Punk overtook my life I went through a very _classic_ rock and roll / rockabilly (and then psychobilly, although the less said about that the better) phase - and bought/acquired lots of rock and roll comps and it was always puzzling to find Hey Paula turning up. Just a look at the first page of Discogs compilations finds it included on "Solid Gold Rock 'n' Roll Vol 2", "Rock 'n' Roll Gold", "64 Original Rock 'n' Roll Greats", "Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll"... but, it's not Rock 'n' Roll. Is it? 

I have always rather loved the song though. So maybe it is rock 'n' roll because even rock 'n' rollers like sweet love songs sometimes?

One album I had that I can remember it being on was the soundtrack to [Lemon Popsicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_Popsicle) which I had on yellow vinyl and was a rock and roll filled compilation from 1978. But... I never saw the film. And, since it was an Israeli film... in Hebrew, it seems unlikely that anyone in the UK saw it, although I guess [this trailer shows it was dubbed into English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Un89PfWaE4) so maybe it did get into some cinemas. I was 14 at the time of release, and it was X-rated so I wouldn't have got to see it anyway! And that trailer doesn't suggest that my life is any less for having missed out on it. It can be found, in its original Hebrew, [on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/eskimo-limon-all-hebrew/Lemon+Popsicle+(1978)+Eskimo+Limon.mkv) (and the subs can [easily be found](https://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/8629230/lemon-popsicle-en) so... maybe I'll give it a go?

It was also used in the awful, overated juvenile nonsense [National Lampoon's Animal House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4eS2SceeFk)... and even the lovely Karen Allen can't make that film watchable!

Anyway... back to the single. It was released in a saucy cover with a warning card obscuring it "remove with caution in the presence of minors" - maybe it's just because I'm a prude but I prefer this _alternative_ sleeve! The painting is by Brian Calvin whose work later turned up on Dean & Britta's [Quarantine Tapes](/2024/05/16/my-record-collection-136-dean-britta-quarantine-tapes-cd/).

I do have another copy of the single... maybe by the time I get to writing about that I'll have made my peace with the sleeve? Although I doubt it!
