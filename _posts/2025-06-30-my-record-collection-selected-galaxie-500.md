The release of The Galaxie 500 box set in 1996 was the first time I became aware that my little web site was on the band's radar, and this lovely promo CD was, I think, the first physical manifestation of that.

Sadly I have lost a lot of my email communication from back then so this may not all be actually true... it is after all almost 30 years ago now.

I'm not sure exactly when I first heard from Andrea at Ryko about the box set but I do have memories of discussing with her what I would put on a promo disc, I'm not sure if anything I said had any bearing on this release, I suspect not. I imagine I certainly would have made a case for {% ahfowtrack "Snowstorm" %}, and possibly {% ahfowtrack "Summertime" %}, neither of which are on this - but otherwise it's pretty close to what I'd have picked.

The CD arrived, unannounced and with a note from Andrea on CD-sized Ryko compliments slip:

<blockquote>
<p>OK Andy,</p>
<p>Here if is. Finally. In your mailbox, almost in your CD player....</p>
<p>Oops. You're probably listening by now.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
<p>AT</p>
</blockquote>

The promo is beautifully packaged, it would have come in one of those greenish Ryko jewel cases - but as always with those boxes the little pegs that hold the disc in place would have fallen off so it has been put into a clear case. Although that means that you can see the inside back of the sleeve which has the gorgeous astronomical illustration that was on the cover of the box.

The insert was a single page and inside it announced the box set release date (24th September 1996) and some credits and contact details.

While I'd heard most of the unreleased content on [the cassette that Matthew sent me](/2023/08/17/my-record-collection-061-galaxie-500-unreleased-sessions-and-live-at-the-rat/) this was probably the first time I heard {% ahfowtrack "Final Day" %} with Dean's vocal.

Selected did get an official release in Japan as "Melt Away" but I don't own a copy of that.

When I interviewed Damon for the Terrascopaedia interview a couple of years ago he explained how Andrea had used my web site, and the Galaxie 500 Mailing List, to help convince Ryko to release the box set - my heart swelled with pride:

<blockquote>
But then Jeff hired a young assistant – maybe she was even an intern at first? – named Andrea Troolin, and Andrea found the project in that pile and made it hers. How to rally the company behind finally doing something with it, however? Your website! Andrea pointed to the Galaxie 500 mailing list, and the activity on it, as evidence that there was interest out there in the band and its out-of-print catalogue. Next thing you know... box set!

Andrea was very good to me, the next treat to arrive was even more jaw-dropping and still one of my most prized possessions:

She also sent me a [promo of Copenhagen](/2024/05/20/my-record-collection-137-galaxie-500-copenhagen-promo-cd/) ahead of its release.
