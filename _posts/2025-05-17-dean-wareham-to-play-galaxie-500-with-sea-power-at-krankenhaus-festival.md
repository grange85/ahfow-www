Dean Wareham has been added to Sea Power's Krankenhaus in August. He is on the bill poster twice, once as _Dean & Britta_, and, once as _Dean Wareham & Sea Power play the songs of Galaxie 500_

The Festival takes place between the 22nd and 24th of August at Muncaster Castle in the English Lake District, [weekend tickets are already on sale](https://krankenhaus.tygit.com/shop/options/pk/12db7f81a522c51976af27af6d984a7d). I'm not sure yet on what day or days Dean and Britta will be playing.

There are lots of other reasons to go on that poster!

Sea Power of course have some Galaxie 500 previous... having covered Tugboat for the 2003 Rough Trade compilation [Stop Me if You've Heard This One Before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Me_If_You_Think_You%27ve_Heard_This_One_Before...) and have [played it live quite](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2009/01/20/video-british-sea-power-covering-tugboat/) often (although annoyingly never while I've been in the room).

The last time I saw Sea Power was 10 minutes down the coast in Cullercoats.
