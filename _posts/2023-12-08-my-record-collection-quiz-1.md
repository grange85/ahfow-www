Now, since we're close to 100 posts in the series, and since it's almost Christmas, and since I get very little feedback on my posts (OK, a bit on Twitter, FB and Instagram, and the occasional email) - I decided to make sure that my dedicated readers, are actually reading!

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/my-record-collection-quiz-1-prize.jpg" "The fabulous prize for the winner!" %}

So - here are twenty questions, the answers to all of them can be found in the [my record collection](/category/my-record-collection/) series of posts, some will be easy to track down the answers to, others might require a bit of _lateral thinking_ or _legwork_ - there will be a fabulous prize for the person with the most correct answers (see the picture below).

Here are the questions if you want to do some research, and then [head over here to fill in your answers](https://forms.gle/oU2JoyUa6vChDhaJ6).
