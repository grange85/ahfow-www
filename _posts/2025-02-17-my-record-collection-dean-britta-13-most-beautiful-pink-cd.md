This is the fifth (of six) versions of Dean & Britta's 13 Most Beautiful Soundtrack, having already has the Double CD version, the DVD, and a sealed copy of the DVD, and a  sealed copy of the double CD version - this is the single CD version in a pink sleeve.

This version was resequenced to match the running order of the DVD, and also had some different mixes - most notably not having the fantastic Sonic Boom remix of Richard Rheem Theme that was on the double CD edition. It also has a hidden extra track - the Scott Hardkiss remix of "Not a Young Man Anymore"... so 14 tracks instead of 13. This is the copy that [Dean & Britta sell (digitally) on Bandcamp](https://deanandbritta.bandcamp.com/album/13-most-beautiful-songs-for-andy-warhols-screen-tests)

The CD was packaged in a nice cardboard, gatefold sleeve and the disc had the same _reel of film_ design as the double CD version. It was limited to 1000 copies... although 1000 copies doesn't seem all that _limited_ to me?
