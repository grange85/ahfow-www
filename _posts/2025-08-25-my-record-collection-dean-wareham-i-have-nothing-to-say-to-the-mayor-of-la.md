Dean announced _I Have Nothing to Say..._ in August 2021 and admitted that it was an album that contained "the first fully realized songs I have written in seven years" although obviously we hadn't really been neglected in that time!

The album was eventually released in November and as well as the eight "fully realized" new songs it also contained covers of {% ahfowtrack "Under Skys" %} by a band called Lazy Smoke about who I knew nothing, and Scott Walker's {% ahfowtrack "Duchess" %} which I did know, and had long adored. It wasn't however too much of a surprise since Dean & Britta had played it during their live streamed shows in September 2020.

The other preview we had had was of {% ahfowtrack "The Corridors of Power" %}, which had been played by Luna as part of live streamed show in May 2021:

The album was recorded at a studio on Stinson Beach in northern California and as part of Dean & Britta's Patreon some video of the recording session was shared... unlisted, via YouTube... and it's still there and since it's now three and a half years since it was shared to patrons I'm going to assume that it's OK for me to share it with everyone else.

Around the time of the album's release Dean and Britta hosted a Zoom _listening party_ limited to 100 people, I promoted it on AHFoW but have no recollection of the actual event... did I make it? It seems I did since I [posted on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVYrLdsM910/) how much I enjoyed it! I can't even blame time-difference exhaustion for not remembering since I posted about it at 10pm... long before my bedtime. I hope I was smart and insightful... if I joined in at all?

The album was announced at the same time as the Quarantine Tapes LP and I bought both for $55 plus shipping. It is in a lovely red vinyl and the back doesn't have the ridiculous black type on a black background that [the CD version has](/2024/06/27/my-record-collection-148-dean-wareham-i-have-nothing-to-say-to-the-mayor-of-la-cd/) but the type used for the lyrics, while bigger than on the CD, is still too small for the comfort of my eyes!

Well... I guess that post has exposed my aging quite badly:
 - I'm losing my memory.
 - My eyesight is knackered.
