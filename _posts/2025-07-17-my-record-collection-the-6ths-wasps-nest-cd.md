The 6ths was one of Stephin Merritt's side projects that released two albums of his own compositions mostly sung by guest artists. Dean guested on the first of these albums Wasps' Nest in 1997.

The track Dean sings on is called {% ahfowtrack "Falling Out of Love With You" %} and is an absolute gem. It's odd that every time I listen to it I _still_ expect it to be Stephin's voice I hear, maybe because it's so obviously a Stephin Merritt song/arrangement.

The whole album is great, with my personal highs being Dean (obviously) but also Barbara Manning singing _San Diego Zoo_, _Winter in July_ with Ayako Akashiba, _Heaven in a Black Leather Jacket_ with Robert Scott ~ actually I just realised that to see my favourites you should probably [just read the track listing]() it's all so great. And, all so familiar, I've obviously listened to the album an awful lot over the 28 years since I bought it. 

I don't listen to the second album _Hyaciths and Thistles_ so much, not sure if that's just beacuse of Dean, or because it's not this good?

The name of the band, and the names of both albums, were apparently chosen becuase they are difficult to say... although I don't think I have a problem with any of them.
