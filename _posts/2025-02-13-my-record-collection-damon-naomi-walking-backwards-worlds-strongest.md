This lovely Damon & Naomi single was released on fab London indie The Great Pop Supplement in 2011 and has _Walking Backwards_ on the a-side and a cover of Scott Walker's _The World's Strongest Man_ on the flip.

So... this was released **fourteen years ago** and is, as we stand, Damon & Naomi's **last seven inch single** - now I know vinyl got stupidly expensive, and seeing Â£15 seven inch singles turn up makes me wince but, I do think a new D&N seven inch is long overdue - although to be fair they've only ever released three (plus two shared) and there was an eleven year gap between the second and third! So maybe I just need to be a bit more patient!

The Great Pop Supplement was the label set up by Dom of Earworm (who released D&N's first seven inch single) and GPS have a couple of other singles in this series.

Damon & Naomi's Scott Walker cover was recorded for, and first released on, the 2009 tribute album released to coincide with the US release of the 2006 film about Scott Walker [30th Century Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Walker:_30_Century_Man).
