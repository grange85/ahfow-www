All Access was a CD compilation of recordings made at the first Terrastock festival in Providence in April 1997. The CD was released with a souvenir edition of Ptolemaic Terrascope that contained reminiscnces and reviews of the event and lots of photocopy quality pictures.

Damon & Naomi's contribution to the CD is a cover of Dylan's I Shall Be Released credited to _Damon & Naomi with Tom Rapp_ although should more accurately be _Tom Rapp with Damon & Naomi_ - it is splendid.

It's funny that I have been so rolled up in Terrastock I since before it happened that it seems odd that I wasn't there. I've read so much, I have the programme (that Bob sent me) I have recordings, I have this magazine, I have more memories of this show than many I actually _was_ at!

Here's one of those _photocopy quality_ pics:
