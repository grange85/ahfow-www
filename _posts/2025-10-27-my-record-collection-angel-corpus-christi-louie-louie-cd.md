Louie Louie is Angel Corpus Christi's album of songs "by, for, and about Lou Reed" and includes her duet with Dean Wareham on _I Want to Boogie With You/Je t'aime_ that was previously released on a couple of 7" singles.

It also has Dean and Britta guesting on a cover of Femme Fatale, a song that Angel seems to visit at regular intervals (I wrote about [Femme Fatale in a recent Substack post](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/the-velvet-undergrounds-femme-fatale)), having been on her excellent I&#9825;NY album in 1985, and a solo accordion version on 2003's Accordion Pop Volume 1. The version on Louie Louie also has Sonic Boom performing and producing and is lovely... as is the whole album and it, like a lot of Angel's catalogue, can be bought for peanuts on her Bandcamp.

After that Substack post I got an email from Angel giving a little insight into the version of Femme Fatale that appears on Louie Louie:

<blockquote>
I dont always love every song I have recorded but I DO love FF… a lot!  Best of all was the surprise of D and B contributing, I had only asked Sonic Boom to mix, I was swept off my feet when this version showed up! 
</blockquote>

It is a very, very beautiful version... prepare to be swept off your feet!

I bought this CD, along with Accordion Pop, via mail order from Glasgow shop Volcanic Tongue in 2005. Volcanic Yongue was run by David Keenan and his wife Heather Leigh and when I bought the CDs Heather wrote "these CDs are so great, we're big Angel fans here". 

I have recently been reading my way through a collection of David Keenan's writings, also called Volcanic Tongue, which is a really good read, I've not read any of his fiction but do also own the soundtrack to the play of his novel Memorial Device which was by Stephen Pastel and Gavin Thompson. I'll get round to reading Memorial Device some time!

This is Angel's fourth entry in this series, and there is (currently) still one to come... although I'm still looking to fill a gap so hopefully two more to come!
