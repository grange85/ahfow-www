Luna's cover of **In the Flesh** was released on Trade 2 - a label set-up by Geoff Travis (Rough Trade) after Rough Trade was acquired by One Little Indian in 1997.

Trade 2 was part of Island Records, which was part of Polygram so ... a major label and despite the positive outlook in an interview at the time the label only seemed to last a couple of years:

<blockquote>
Our response to that is to start a new label called Trade 2 with Island Records so again, we're part of a major corporation. We're pretty happy at the moment. We have a pretty stable financial structure. We have freedom to do what we want to do.
</blockquote>

The sleeve has a photo (taken by Justin) of Dean playing the Bongos, while Sean looks on - Dean has phenomenal bedhead in it. The b-side is _Early Morning_ another of those Luna b-side instrumentals they seem to be able to trot out with ease... so easy in fact they [made a whole EP](/2024/06/03/my-record-collection-141-luna-a-place-of-greater-safety/) of them!

In the Flesh was Blondie's second single, and first _hit_ (reaching no.2 in Australia).

 - *Catalogue Number:* AHFOW 11/032

 - I bought this when it was released, probably in the Rough Trade (Talbot Rd) shop, or Beggars Banquet in Kingston.
