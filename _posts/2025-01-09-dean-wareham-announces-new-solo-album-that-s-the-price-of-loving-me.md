The album was recorded during the summer with Galaxie 500 producer Kramer

<blockquote>
That’s the Price of Loving Me, was recorded over six days in Los Angeles. Kramer stayed with Dean and his wife, Britta Phillips, and they even paused recording one day to see Kurosawa’s Ran. The album’s 10 tracks retain echoes of Wareham and Kramer’s earlier work but are more complex, with influences from Bacharach, Gainsbourg, and Norma Tanega

 That’s the Price of Loving Me, was recorded over six days in Los Angeles. Kramer stayed with Dean and his wife, Britta Phillips, and they even paused recording one day to see Kurosawa’s Ran. The album’s 10 tracks retain echoes of Wareham and Kramer’s earlier work but are more complex, with influences from Bacharach, Gainsbourg, and Norma Tanega. Dean’s signature guitar stylings anchor the songs, and Kramer encouraged him to play all the guitar parts. “Kramer believes two takes yield more treasure than twenty,” says Dean. Kramer’s touch is evident throughout, playing piano, organ, and synthesizers. Phillips contributes bass and vocals, while Roger Brogan and Anthony LaMarca handle drums. Gabe Noel arranged and performed cello on four tracks without hearing them beforehand.

As well as aslew of new originals the album also contains covers of Mayo Thompson's "Dear Betty Baby" from his 1970 album [Corky's Debt to His Father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corky%27s_Debt_to_His_Father) and the [Lütz Ulbrich/Nico](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BC%C3%BCl) song Reich Der Träume from 1982.

You can [pre-order the album from Dean's Bandcamp](https://deanwareham.bandcamp.com/album/thats-the-price-of-loving-me) in clear vinyl or Carpark Records exclusive _neon pink_; and the clear vinyl version has also turned up in a couple of UK online record shops [Norman Records](https://www.normanrecords.com/records/207124-dean-wareham-thats-the-price-of-loving) and [Rough Trade](https://www.roughtrade.com/en-gb/product/dean-wareham/thats-the-price-of-loving-me) and will doubtless turn up in others soon.
