Up until now the progress reports have pretty much been nothing more than a bunch of numbers, but since we're now over half-way through the project I thought I should try and be a little more insightful... although, there's still going to be numbers!

When I started the project, back at the beginning of 2023 I don't think I was aware of just how big a project it was, my intention was to just do the occasional post, be a bit selective, and have it all wrapped up in a few months... but, here we are 850 days on and still the end is well over a year away.

Having said that, I have really enjoyed revisiting these records - it's too easy to just keep picking from a small subset so, having a project like this, has forced me to listen to things I haven't listened to very often, and in some cases, not at all. Some of it has been an absolute joy to get back to - for example I really enjoyed pulling out the [Pee Shy records](/2024/07/25/my-record-collection-156-pee-shy-who-let-all-the-monkeys-out/) that Dean produced; or listening to _the other tracks_ on the compilations that have only one or two tracks that got them included - e.g. [The Ladybug Transistor and Kevin Ayers playing Puis-je/May I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36IBLlsCzms) on [Pop Romantique](/2023/08/31/my-record-collection-065-pop-romantique-french-pop-classics/) and [Marbles by Tindersticks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKRfWcRZpYM) that appeared on [Speed Dating](/2024/08/22/my-record-collection-164-various-artists-speed-dating/) - although I'll be happy never to have to listen to Dwarves again (on that same comp).

I have sometimes found it tricky to come up with interesting things to say so posts can vary in length:

Five longest posts:
 - [\[059\] Luna The Days of Our Nights (LP)](/2023/08/08/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-1-luna-the-days-of-our-nights-lp/) (1028 words)
 - [\[080\] Galaxie 500 - Blue Thunder](/2023/10/12/my-record-collection-077-galaxie-500-blue-thunder/) (975 words)
 - [\[185\] Galaxie 500 - Uncollected Noise New York '88-'90](/2024/10/08/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-09-and-10-galaxie-500-uncollected-noise-new-york-88-90/) (939 words)
 - [\[154\] The Wondrous World of Damon & Naomi (promo CD)](/2024/06/24/my-record-collection-147-the-wondrous-world-of-damon-naomi-promo-cd/) (877 words)
 - [\[073\] Luna - Lunafied (CDR)](/2023/09/18/my-record-collection-070-luna-lunafied-cd/) (793 words)

... and the five shortest:
 - [\[113\] Galaxie 500 - Oblivious (Chemical Imbalance)](/2024/02/08/my-record-collection-108-galaxie-500-oblivious-chemical-imbalance/) (160 words)
 - [\[150\] The Pastels - Worlds of Possibility (CDS)](/2024/06/10/my-record-collection-143-the-pastels-worlds-of-possibility-cds/) (149 words)
 - [\[068\] Magic Hour - Heads Down](/2023/09/04/my-record-collection-066-magic-hour-heads-down/) (146 words)
 - [\[005\] The Wondrous World of Damon & Naomi (CD)](/2023/02/02/my-record-collection-005-the-wondrous-world-of-damon-naomi-cd/) (82 words)
 - [\[149\] Dean Wareham - answerphone message (1997)](/2024/06/06/my-record-collection-142-dean-wareham-answerphone-message-mc/) (60 words)

Most of the posts (109) have been about CD or CDr - although I suspect over the last few years vinyl has been putting in a strong push to catch up, here are the lists of posts by format:

So... still plenty of catching up to do, fortunately there is still plenty of activity from Galaxie 500's former band members - the following have all been released since the project started:

- [\[042\] Angel Corpus Christi - Bewitched: A Tribute to Luna](/2023/06/12/my-record-collection-042-angel-corpus-christi-bewitched-a-tribute-to-luna/)
- [\[059\] Luna The Days of Our Nights (LP)](/2023/08/08/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-1-luna-the-days-of-our-nights-lp/)
- [\[062\] Britta Phillips & Kramer - Nocturnes](/2023/08/15/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-2-britta-phillips-kramer-nocturnes/)
- [\[071\] Naomi Yang - Never Be a Punching Bag for Nobody](/2023/09/12/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-03-naomi-yang-never-be-a-punching-bag-for-nobody/)
- [\[099\] Dean Wareham - Live at St Pancras Old Church December 2013](/2023/12/16/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-04-dean-wareham-live-at-st-pancras-old-church-december-2013/)
- [\[102\] Dean & Britta - Chansons de Vampires](/2023/12/23/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-05-dean-britta-chansons-de-vampires/)
- [\[136\] Dean & Britta - L'avventura (RSD 2024)](/2024/04/26/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-16-dean-britta-l-avventura-rsd-2024/)
- [\[138\] Luna - Live Bewitched and Live Rendezvous](/2024/04/30/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-07-and-08-luna-live-bewitched-and-live-rendezvous/)
- [\[185\] Galaxie 500 - Uncollected Noise New York '88-'90](/2024/10/08/my-record-collection-recent-acquisition-09-and-10-galaxie-500-uncollected-noise-new-york-88-90/)

... and only one of those is a CD (although I do also have a CD copy of Uncollected in the backlog).

I have also been quietly filling in the collection with some older releases as well... but those are just getting added into the spreadsheet to be randomly picked at some point.

- In progress report #1 (after the first 50 posts) the estimated completion date was Thursday 7th May 2026
- In progress report #2 it was Thursday 27th July 2026
- In progress report #3 it was Monday, 23th July 2026 (I think this was after some backlog refinement)
- In progress report #4 it was Thursday, 16th July 2026 (I think I actually forgot to include some after massaging the spreadsheet)

The current estimated completion date is back to Thursday, 27th July 2026

OK, that pretty much turned out to just be a bunch of stats anyway!

I have written over 94000 words in the series so far, which means I've pushed past _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ and am heading up towards _The Hobbit_!

The total number of rows (=posts) in my spreadsheet is 375 (up 6 from [progress report #4](/2024/11/29/progress-report-4-151-200/) - although that might be due to the mis-counting I mentioned above)
