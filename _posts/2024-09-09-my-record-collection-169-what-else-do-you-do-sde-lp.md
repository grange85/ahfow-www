This is the Shimmy Disc Europe copy of the _What Else Do You Do_ compilation and differs from the [US release](/2024/02/05/my-record-collection-107-various-artists-what-else-do-you-do/) in having a yellow sleeve, rather than the salmon pink one.

This LP has Dean's early version of Smile, recorded while he was still in Galaxie 500 and I suspect had a small part to play in the bands demise:

<blockquote>
Those other songs you mention ‑‑ ‘Indian Summer’ and ‘Smile’ ‑‑ are things Dean did on his own, before the band broke up. (Like we with our Pierre Etoile project.) ‘Indian Summer’ is by Beat Happening, I can't remember what he did that for, and ‘Smile’ was something Dean did for a Shimmy comp while we were working on the last album (without telling us beforehand, I might add... water under the bridge, water under the bridge...)
</blockquote>

I bought this LP in, I think, in the Virgin Megastore on the corner of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road around the time of release.
