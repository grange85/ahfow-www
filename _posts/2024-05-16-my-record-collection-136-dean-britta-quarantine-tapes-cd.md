This is the third appearance of Dean & Britta's Quarantine Tapes in this series, this is the CD version that has two more tracks than [the LP](/2023/03/16/my-record-collection-017-dean-britta-quarantine-tapes-white-label-lp/) (Air and Ride Into The Sun) and includes The Carnival is Over, that wasn't in the [lathe-cut box set](/2024/02/26/my-record-collection-113-quarantine-tapes-lathe-cut-box-of-singles/) although had been [released as a lathe-cut](/2023/05/22/my-record-collection-036-dean-britta-the-carnival-is-over/) on its own.

On the LP _I'm So Bored With The USA_ is at the end of side A and segues into _The Carnival is Over_ but fades before it gets going. _The Carnival is Over_ then opens side B. Oddly on the CD the fade out and re-start happens rather than just letting them run together. I suspect because the version of _The Carnival is Over_ wasn't the one played after _I'm So Bored..._, but it does feel a bit strange to fade it out and then start it again - it sort of made sense flipping over the LP but is just odd on the CD.

Oh, actually I just noticed the sleeve notes make it clear which are the _live_ tracks, just six of them... I sort of had assumed it was more.

I sort of love the sleeve, as I might have mentioned before that I'm a bit cool on Brian Calvin's lips, but I do like the layout and typography used, and the picture of Dean and Britta on the back is lovely.
