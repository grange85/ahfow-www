This is a sealed copy of the lovely double DVD of video that the band released in 2004, it was given to me as a gift and, since I already had a copy, stayed in it's shrink wrap - as an archival copy - it is after all the only Galaxie 500 release that I get a name check on!

Since it's sealed I guess all I can talk about is what's on the outside (I'll talk about what's inside in a later post).

It contains a hype sticker on the front:

<blockquote>
<p>4 HOURS on 2 DVDs</p>
<p>"Galaxie 500 make some of the starkest, most <strong>beautiful</strong> American underground music"<br>MELODY MAKER</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">DVD case hype sticker</p>

That quote is from a [1996 Stephen Pastel review of the Galaxie 500 box set](https://oblivious.fullofwishes.co.uk/post/46418741985/stephen-pastel-reviews-the-galaxie-500-box-set-for)

There's another quote on the back that I have to take a bit of exception with...
{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/galaxie-500-dloygtw-box-quote.jpg" "Quote on the box" %}
<blockquote>
<p>"One of the most influential bands to emerge from the late-80s independent rock scene"<br>Karen Schomer, The New York Times</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Quote on the back of the DVD case</p>

I found the origin of that quote in a [1990 New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/arts/pop-view-music-s-new-catatonia-don-t-bother-getting-up.html), but the actual quote is:

<blockquote>
<p>Galaxie 500 <strong>could be</strong> one of the most influential bands to emerge from the late-80's independent rock scene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/arts/pop-view-music-s-new-catatonia-don-t-bother-getting-up.html">POP VIEW; Music's New Catatonia: Don't Bother Getting Up</a> (New York Times, 14th October 1990) <em>(my emphasis)</em></p>

Now, you can call me a pedant if you like but there is a world of difference between "_is_", which is implied in the quote on the box, and "_could be_" which is clearly stated in the article. I would also have some concerns about declaring a band as _influential_ just two years after their first album, surely that's too soon to speculate on _influence_?

Maybe after 34 years we can probably declare that Galaxie 500 have been influential, so maybe my concerns are unnecessary since Karen's presumptuous speculation seems to have been not too wide of the mark, and maybe because of that, Galaxie 500's quote bending is OK?&dagger;
