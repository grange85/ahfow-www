Within These Walls was Damon & Naomi's sixth/seventh studio album released in 2007, but only on CD. It finally got an LP release ten years later.

This is the album that was inspired by Frank Sinatra and was an effort "to record the slowest, saddest songs of an already notably slow and sad catalogue" - and it is slow, and it is sad, and it is because of that very very beautiful.

<blockquote>
I’ve been on a huge Sinatra binge for the last two years, particularly his sad albums on Capitol. We got really into the idea of a sad concept album, which is something that we’ve always tried to shy away from. It’s a very small group that we’re working with, but we were thinking in terms of large orchestration.

The "small group" was comprised mostly of Damon & Naomi's _stock company_ - Michio Kurihara on guitar, Bhob Rainey on soprano sax, Greg Kelley on trumpet with Kyle Bruckman on oboe and cor anglais plus the addition of a small string contingent - Helene Espvall and Margaret Wienk on cello and Katt Hernandez on violin - this was the "large orchestration".

When I [posted about False Beats and True Hearts](/2025/05/22/my-record-collection-damon-naomi-false-beats-and-true-hearts-cd/) back in May I pointed out the difficulty I had picking a favourite Damon & Naomi album:

<blockquote>
I have absolutely no qualms about ranking Luna albums and would even occasionally try and rank Galaxie 500’s but it’s not something I can do with Damon & Naomi’s output [...] more than any of the other AHFoW related artists the best Damon & Naomi album is invariably the last one I listened to.

... and this just proves the point - I'm not sure that 40 minutes ago I'd have picked Within These Walls as one of my top D&N albums, but right now it is my absolute favourite. It starts and ends with two absolute gems, Lilac Land, so slow and so very sad "I don't want you to call, 'cause my heart is now broken". I just headed to YouTube to pick a clip to play and discovered that I invariably video Lilac Land when I see Damon & Naomi - I did in 2009, 2014, and 2016 - here they are at Cafe Oto in 2014:

The album closes with Cruel Queen, which I feel owes more to British folk balladry than Sinatra, and has always been a song I adore. Here they are playing it live in a bookshop:

{% ahfowvideo "wyeUwOGPIuo" "Damon & Naomi Cruel Queen (Thing In The Spring 2008)" "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/damon-naomi-cruel-queen-vidcap.jpg" %}

Damon & Naomi acknowledge the song's roots on the sleeve "Cruel Queen is based on the traditional song _The Trees They Do Grow High_" - I knew the song thanks to Pentangle's version on their beautiful half-live double album [Sweet Child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Child), but it is a folk standard so Damon & Naomi's knowledge may stem from elsewhere. Here's Pentangle's version:

BUT... there is one issue I have with the album and this is entirely _my problem with it_ - the sleeve has a picture of some flowers in a glass, but that's not what I see, I always see something anatomical and I can't not see that. I suspect that since I first had this album on CD that the small artwork didn't help things but I can't help but cringe at it - which is so wrong since, clearly, it is a flower, and it is a beautiful picture... but, [this is what I see](https://www.cincymuseum.org/2020/08/18/whats-in-the-jar/)!
