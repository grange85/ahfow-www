This box set of Luna's first five albums, plus an album of extras, was announced in June 2015 with an uncertain "Fall/Winter" release date. Captured Tracks announced it was taking pre-orders in December because of "overwhelming demand" and suggested it would be released in February or March. The album finally started arriving in June, a full year after the announcement and more than six months after pre-ordering.

In order to save on postage costs I had my copy sent to Mike in the US in the hope that someone would mule it over at some point in the future... that someone was Joakim and that point in the future was before Luna's show in Oxford in October. 

Of course, there was almost nothing in this box that I didn't already own, probably multiple times, already so I'm not 100% certain that any of these have actually been played before, but happy to give them a spin now - but I'll spare you a blow-by-blow account - I suspect by now you're well aware of my love to Luna and my complete lack of any real objectivity or any real ability to describe what I'm listening to.

What I didn't have of course are the following items:

### LP #6 "Rarities"

Rarities was a collection of singles/b-sides and possibly only had maybe two or three genuine rarities - and since I already had almost everything on the LP not much was rare to me!

- {% ahfowtrack "Egg Nog" %} - Originally released on the Luna [_not quite Christmas_ single in 1992](/2023/12/18/my-record-collection-096-luna-time-egg-nog-red-vinyl/), and on the Indian Summer EP the following year.
- {% ahfowtrack "Indian Summer" %}, Ride Into The Sun and That's What You Always Say - all released on the two 1993 EPs - Indian Summer and Slide.
- {% ahfowtrack "Anesthesia" %} (demo) - this [was released as a Dean Wareham solo single in 1991](/2023/07/13/my-record-collection-051-dean-wareham-anesthesia/).
- {% ahfowtrack "In The Flesh" %} - released on a [7" single in 1997](/2024/07/18/my-record-collection-154-luna-in-the-flesh/) and on the [Bobby Peru CD single](/2024/12/09/my-record-collection-195-luna-bobby-peru-cd/).
- {% ahfowtrack "Bonnie and Clyde" %} - the LP doesn't say which version this is - it's the _Clyde Barrow version_ - the fast (better) version. This is probably the least rare track on rarities since it was the unlisted bonus track on the Penthouse CD which is the copy most people have.
- {% ahfowtrack "I Know You Tried" %} (demo) - this was the only previously unreleased track so... a genuine rarity - and as far as I know this box is still the only place you can get it (officially).
- {% ahfowtrack "Roll in the Sand" %} - this was released on the b-side of the [Outdoor Miner single in 1996](/2023/08/21/my-record-collection-062-luna-outdoor-miner/).

... and [Dear Paulina](https://aheadfullofwishes.substack.com/p/the-making-of-lunas-dear-paulina) - previously only released on a mail-order only 7" single in 1999 - it was lovely seeing this turn up on this box set although the loveliness was somewhat tempered as the sleeve of the single never made it into the booklet.

### Luna - Long Players 92-99 (48 page booklet)

The accompanying booklet, despite the above mentioned omission, was a lovely piece of work containing:

 - an oral history made up of interviews with Justin, Stanley, Sean, Lee and Paul Kimble... but not Dean!?
 - an interview with Dean by Noah Baumbach - [this had already shown up in Salon in May 2016](https://www.salon.com/2016/05/20/the_ultimate_luna_interview_noah_baumbach_and_dean_wareham_talk_super_groups_the_velvet_underground_and_the_history_of_one_of_new_yorks_greatest_bands/)
 - a "collection of posters and flyers" from Dean's collection - just a single page photo, annotated separately.
 - a "collection of singles and EPs" from Dean's collection also a single page photo annotated separately and with a missing single!

There was also a lovely poster by John Conley (who helped me a lot in the making of [On Fire \| 30](https://aheadfullofwishes.bandcamp.com/album/on-fire-30) and [This Music is Ours](https://aheadfullofwishes.bandcamp.com/album/this-music-is-ours).

All in all a lovely package.
