El May is the working name of one-time almost Luna member Lara Meyerratken and was released in 2014 and is an album that might have slipped through the net since Dean's contribution is as one of many _additional_ vocalists on one track.

But it made it into [my record collection](/category/my-record-collection/) since I managed to pick up a new copy on Discogs for just over a fiver, and I'm very glad I did since it is a rather lovely piece of work. I should have known because I'd already bought her first self-titled album (as a download) in 2012.

Lara was briefly a member of Luna around the time of Romantica, brought into the band to "help [them] capture the sounds of [their] new record, to play the fake strings, sampled trumptes, mellotrons and other keyboard sounds" _(Dean Wareham - Black Postcards)_.

Dean and Britta's contribution to The Other Person is You is to the track _My Policeman is an Addict_ listen out for them...

Luna's Sean Eden adds his guitar to a few of the tracks too.

At the London date of Luna's 2015 reunion tour El May played a short and lovely support slot switching between guitar and keyboards.
