We arrived in Hebden Bridge on Tuesday, late afternoon - settled into our lovely and took a stroll around to get the lay of the land... the very steep and watery land.

Wednesday we planned to do more local exploring and after a late start we found ourselves having lunch in a Hebden Bridge cafe only to get interrupted...
