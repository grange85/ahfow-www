A few nice clips of Dean's UK shows (so far) have turned up on YouTube here are a few:

{% ahfowtrack "When Will You Come Home was" %}, for me, the highlight of the Glasgow show, I never don't get a buzz hearing Galaxie 500 songs live and this was perfect - do love a wigged out finish!
{% ahfowvideo "X6r_PuHlDSY" "When Will You Come Home (Glasgow)" %}

I wonder if Dean can't **not** do {% ahfowtrack "Ceremony" %} when they play in Manchester?
{% ahfowvideo "uyRBJPxf8Mg" "Ceremony (Manchester)" %}

They've been opening the shows with {% ahfowtrack "New World Julie" %} which might be my favourite song on the new album (although... the jury's still out):
{% ahfowvideo "MJ7b3OxW6v0" "New World Julie (Leamington Spa)" %}

The Luna songs they've played have been in very different, much sweeter, arrangements - here they are playing {% ahfowtrack "Friendly Advice" %}:
{% ahfowvideo "iuHKMj1BA5E" "Friendly Advice (Leamington Spa)" %}

[Dan's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@danwuori9476) has quite a few clips from the Leamington show - here's the tour debut of the album's title track {% ahfowtrack "That's the Price of Loving Me" %}:
{% ahfowvideo "HJzzqYlPgiU" "That's the Price of Loving Me (Leamington Spa)" %}

A [search of YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22dean+wareham%22&sp=CAI%253D) will throw up plenty more.

Leeds, Bristol and London still to come, so expect more... and then a stack of European dates - [see a list of upcoming shows](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/dean-and-britta/shows/)
