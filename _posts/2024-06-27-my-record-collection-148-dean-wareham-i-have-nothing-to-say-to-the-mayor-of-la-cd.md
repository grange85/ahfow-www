Dean's third (or second depending on your view on the status of [Emancipated Hearts](/2023/01/26/my-record-collection-003-dean-wareham-emancipated-hearts/) solo album is an absolute gem, maybe I still prefer his self-titled (2nd) album, but that's possibly familiarity and also the lovely shows I saw when he was over here promoting it. But this is a blinder all the same, and I get the impression that Dean thinks it's better.

The cover painting is by [San Francisco artist Chris Lux](https://www.instagram.com/chrislux/) and I do rather like it although I'm not too sure what I'm looking at!

While *I* have nothing to say to the mayor of LA I do have a couple of things to say to the CD sleeve designer:

- I have evidence that supports the fact that Dean's audience is aging (along with Dean) and therefore our eyes are probably not what they were - the type used for the lyrics and the credits in the CD insert is *far too small* for our aging eyes - I literally had to use my phone to ensure I had the name of the cover artist correct!
- Black text on a black background is surely not a good idea? The tracklisting on the back is virtually unreadable.

The LP version thankfully hasn't been given the black text on black background reverse, although the type is still pretty small!

 - *Catalogue Number:* AHFOW 10/161
 - *Artist:* Dean Wareham
 - *Title:* I Have Nothing to Say to The Mayor of LA
 - *Packaging:* Jewel case

 - I ordered a LP bundle of this and Quarantine Tapes - I don't think I bought the CD but got Dean to pop one in for me??
