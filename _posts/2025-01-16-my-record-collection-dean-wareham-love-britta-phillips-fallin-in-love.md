This is the blue vinyl copy of Dean and Britta's split single released on Formosa Punk back in 2014.

This copy was sent by Mike at Formosa Punk, via Robert, and was actually Robert's copy that he mistakenly gave me when he was over for the Dean Wareham show in London in May 2014. Luckily I think Mike sent Robert another blue copy. I also have two unattached labels that Mike also sent to me at some point.

Everything I wrote about [this single a couple of months back](/2024/11/07/my-record-collection-186-dean-wareham-love-britta-phillips-fallin-in-love/) obviously still applies - so head over there and read that. You can also listen to both tracks over there too.
