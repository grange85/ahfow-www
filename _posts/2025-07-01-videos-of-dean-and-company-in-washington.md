Dan has just posted a couple of lovely videos from Dean Wareham's show at the Songbyrd in Washington DC a couple of weeks back - Dean's band for the last batch of shows was dubbed 'Dean & Company' by support act Ian Svenonius of Esacpe-ism - the band was Dean and Britta with Derek Wheeler James on drums and Skylar Kaplan on guitar.

Keep an eye on [Dan's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KilgoreBooks) because I think there are more on the way.

Steven posted this fab clip of the band playing the lovely loungey cover of Luna's {% ahfowtrack "Friendly Advice" %} that the band have been playing on the tour:
