I always speculated that this was my _second_ Galaxie 500 purchase, after the CD of On Fire. That's probably true, although it might have been the first since I first heard On Fire on a cassette given to me by a journalist friend probably before it was released.

I've always been slightly puzzled why I bought On Fire on CD, and Today on LP which might suggest that I bought Today first but to be honest around the LP -> CD transition my buying was a little random... by the time of This Is Our Music I had probably fully embraced CDs - although continued to buy singles on vinyl.

Either way this is my original copy of Today released on Shimmy Disc Europe and has of course been well played, and well loved, being my only copy until the box set release in 1996.

It still has the price sticker on it so I know that I bought it at HMV and that I paid £7.49.

Now my ears, after years of heavy metal (and other loud concert) abuse aren't really up to much but when I mentioned to Dean my multiple copies of Today on vinyl he asked which one I liked best - was it an original or one that was remastered for the re-releases.

<blockquote>
<p>That was probably the first time [I've] listened to them side-by-side and closely enough to try and form an opinion ~ although not sure that I came down on either side.</p>
<p>In recent years when I play the vinyl I tend to pick one of the pre-Ryko ones (I have RT and Aurora vinyl to go with my SDE one) - but it's more likely for nostalgia than any other reason.</p>
<p>I think I nicely skirted around giving an answer there!</p>

Dean was very much of the opinion that the earlier versions were superior ... "so you agree with me :)".

However I listen it doesn't stop being a breathtaking ride though.
