Having confidently speculated that Damon & Naomi's appearance on [Tanya Donnelly's Swan Song](/2024/01/18/my-record-collection-102-tanya-donelly-swan-song-series/) was "possibly the release in this series with the largest signal:noise ratio" it almost instantly gets usurped by Not Alone, a 5xCD collection in aid of Medecins sans frontieres.

This has Damon & Naomi's cover of Gram Parsons' A Song For You - 4'09" of the almost six hour running time of the set! Fortunately (as with Swan Song) there's plenty more to love: Vashti Bunyan, Shirley and Dolly Collins (separately), Teenage Fanclub, Six Organs... etc. etc.

Damon & Naomi's cover of _A Song For You_ was described in the sleeve notes as being from the soundcheck for "Live in San Sebastian" - so recorded during the fake soundcheck for their fake live album. This track is available on their [Spirit of Love (B-sides, bonuses, and soundtracks)](https://damonandnaomi.bandcamp.com/album/spirit-of-love-b-sides-bonuses-and-soundtracks) compilation.

Damon & Naomi played A Song For You, with Kurihara, for Spin back when they did that sort of thing... it went AWOL for a while but I managed to salvage a low-res Flash version and popped it on YouTube, it looks pretty ropey but... sounds ok, with the odd drop out and jitter. And always lovely to see Naomi on the harmonium - now she's taking her bass on tour I've decided to miss her harmonium!
