I've just come across a few videos I took back on this day fifteen years ago of Dean & Britta's show for Sonic Cathedral at St Giles in The Fields church in London.

It was the first time Dean & Britta had been in London for over two years and they were joined by Cheval Sombre and Sonic Boom. Here's an extract from my review at the time:

<blockquote>
<p>
    For Dean & Britta I decided to stand up against a pillar at the side of the church, this meant I couldn't see Britta at all but at least I could see the rest of the band. They launched straight into Tugboat and proceeded through a nice mix of Galaxie 500, Luna and Dean & Britta songs. Highlights were the Galaxie 500 songs, because, once I accept that Dean & Britta are not Galaxie 500, then Hearing Voices was lovely and even Snowstorm (which was previously on the receiving end of a sacrilegious rant) was beautiful. The keyboards were less intrusive and the drums seemed better suited.
</p>
<p>
    They encored with Night Nurse and a fantastic Ceremony and it was all done in little over an hour. Two and a half years wait and it all seemed over so quickly. I went and shared an uncomfortable few minutes with Dean & Britta and then spent the journey home thinking of all the clever/insightful/interesting things I could have said. I wish I was better with people... particularly people as nice as Dean & Britta - they deserve better.
</p>

The videos aren't perfect (I'll blame the tech of the day), but don't _sound_ too bad, and it's lovely to be reminded of such a special night.
