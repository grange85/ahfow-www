Dean & Britta will be playing at The Trades Club in Hebden Bridge as a duo on the 21st August. This one caught me by surprise, and I know nothing more than [this page](https://thetradesclub.com/events/deanbritta) tells me - I have no idea whether this will be part of a wider tour or is just a one off - obv as soon as I learn more I'll let you know.

In the meantime you can [buy tickets here](https://thetradesclub.com/events/deanbritta) for what is described thus:

<blockquote>
Dean & Britta are Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips; they have been making records together since Britta joined the band Luna in 2000. At the Trades Club, Dean & Britta will perform as a duo, a special set of songs from their back catalog (Galaxie 500, Luna) and from Dean’s new album That’s the Price of Loving Me.

My ticket has been acquired so hopefully see some friendly faces there!
