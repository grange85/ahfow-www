Back in May, while on their west coast tour, Dean Wareham and his band popped into the KEXP studios in Seattle and recorded a session.

The video of the session is now available to view on KEXP's YouTube and has the band playing three tracks from his new album "That's The Price of Loving Me", plus "The Last Word" from his previous album, and finishing up with a cover of Galaxie 500's Snowstorm. There's also a short interview.

There are also a [stack of lovely pics by Renate Steiner](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kexp/albums/72177720326303943/) from the session on Flickr.
