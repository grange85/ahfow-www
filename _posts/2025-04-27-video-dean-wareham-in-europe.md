Now that Dean's European jaunt is over I think it must be time for another selection of clips, this time from the mainland leg of the tour - I think by default I've always been inclined to pick Galaxie 500 songs, I'll try not to do that (so much) this time!

First up {% ahfowtrack "Bourgeois Manqué" %} from the new album
{% ahfowvideo "MtHbOkjqrUA" "Dean Wareham - Bourgeois Manqué (Copenhagen)" %}

I think Dean saved singing in German until he was in Germany:
{% ahfowvideo "6JjGOzNJr2k" "Dean Wareham - Reich Der Träume (Hamburg)" %}

{% ahfowvideo "7us591Bv-KM" "Dean Wareham - We're Not Finished Yet (Utrecht)" %}

For the show in Utrecht I think Matt was poorly/unavailable so the show was played as a three piece, with a changed setlist because of that... including Britta getting to lead on {% ahfowtrack "Listen, The Snow is Falling" %}:

{% ahfowvideo "X--JQBi7CSE" "Dean Wareham - Listen, The Snow is Falling (Utrecht)" %}

... and Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste getting an outing!

{% ahfowvideo "uOR8VmwQr9w" "Dean Wareham - Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste (Utrecht)" %}

I love that The Last Word from Dean's previous album has become a duet with Britta for this tour - it works beautifully. Here they are singing it in Valencia:
{% ahfowvideo "tCCPTkQJYwo" "Dean Wareham (and Britta!)- The Last Word (Valencia)" %}

... and I know I shared this in my [Groningen diary post](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2025/04/19/diary-dean-wareham-in-groningen-12th-april-2025/) but, I was there so... I'll share it again!

_(see how badly I did on not picking Galaxie 500 songs!)_
