Mutton Gun (or MuttonGun or Muttongun) are another of Justin Harwood's _other_ projects who made three albums in the early 1990s and I'm making a few assumptions about Dean's involvement in this, their third, released in 1994. Hopefully someone can clarify things.

So, this is my thinking...
 - [Dean was credited, it seems twice, on the first Mutton Gun album Amplexus](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/mutton-gun-amplexus-credits.jpg), one of those credits was as _Dong Wareham_ (so that album will appear in this series at some point).
 - (Their second album _Into the Hogger_ has a great muddle of credits and nonsense on the sleeve but none of which _seem_ to suggest Dean's involvement - scratched into the run out groove is the question "[_DEAN WHERE ARE YOU?_](https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/mutton-gun-into-the-hogger-runout-groove.jpg)").
 - III (with Wood) has a credit for _"dong weener with spacesuit (thanks for the use of the moonbuggy)"_.

I'm assuming that _dong weener_ = _Dong Wareham_ = Dean Wareham, and if that's the case he gets a credit on _III (with Wood)_, however _"with spacesuit"_ and _"use of the moonbuggy"_ doesn't clarify whether Dean actually contributed anything to the album that you can actually hear.

Luna's then drummer Stanley Demeski is certainly the credit that reads _"thanks to stan dementos for the drums (Jersey Rules!!)"_ - but even that is unclear whether it's for the sound of the drums or the physical object!

The album was produced by Kramer (and Mutton Gun) and released on his Kokopop label.

I do like all of the Mutton Gun albums, although they do occasionally get as messy as the albums sleeve credits, but I think I like this one best, the opening track _Rain, Rain_ is some top-notch 90s indie. Although their persistent use of snippets from film and TV between the songs does get a little bit annoying... but it is one of their _things_, a USP?!
