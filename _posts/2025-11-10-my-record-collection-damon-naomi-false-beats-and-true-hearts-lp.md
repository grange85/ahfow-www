Damon & Naomi's False Beats and True Hearts was released on their own 20\|20\|20 label in May 2011, I bought it [on CD](/2025/05/22/my-record-collection-damon-naomi-false-beats-and-true-hearts-cd/) back then. I bought this LP in 2013 when the [Wondrous World bootleg edition](/2025/06/23/my-record-collection-the-wondrous-world-of-damon-naomi-bootleg-edition/) was released and I filled my basket to try and make the postage seem less ridiculous.

The picture on the front cover of the sleeve is by French photographer Bernard Faucon who took a [series of photos called "Summer Camp"](https://www.bernardfaucon.fr/summer-camp/?lang=en#) using dummies between 1976 and 1981:

<blockquote>
The summer of ’76 got off to a flying start. I could feel my strength and my youth burst open. I filled the Mehari (my cheap Citroen open-top car) with dummies and I was all over the drives, the dormitory in my parents’ children home, the churchyard in Lioux, the swimming-pool in Saint-Saturnin, the beaches of Saintes-Maries de la Mer in the Camargue. I would hurriedly set up the dummies , and after the shot, pack up and set off again. As they invested those places that bore the mark of my childhood I imagined  that those little men freed from their shop-windows, released unknown forces, brought to light sublime, masterful evidence.

I must admit that I found the picture on the sleeve a bit bewildering, perhaps even a bit creepy, and was never entirely sure what to make of it - but having now seen it as part of the larger project it's a bit easier to grasp. There are others in the series I like more but maybe it is the perplexing nature of the photo that was what was required for the album?

The LP has a hype sticker with a couple of quotes... maybe the CD did too but I no longer have it.

<blockquote>
<strong>DAMON & NAOMI</strong> have slowly, steadily, stealthily made themselves into one of the most consistently interesting cultural juggernauts on the contemporary scene.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Over two decades &mdash; first as the rhythm section of Galaxie 500 and then on a series of low-key studio albums &mdash; <strong>DAMON & NAOMI</strong> have mastered the art of intimacy.

Both quotes were in reviews written about their previous album [Within These Walls](/2025/10/20/my-record-collection-damon-naomi-within-these-walls-lp/) but most certainly still apply to False Beats and True Hearts!
