I just came across the official [Sean Eden website](https://web.archive.org/web/20061219+/http://seaneden.com). I
guess it's pretty new (and maybe not even officially launched) but there's a
bit of content and a blog with nothing but a test post (but a blog is a good
thing!). It's looking good and nice to see things happening...
