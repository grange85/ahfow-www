<p>I just came across the official <a href="http://seaneden.com">Sean Eden website</a>. I guess it's pretty new (and maybe not even officially launched) but there's a bit of content and a blog with nothing but a test post (but a blog is a good thing!). It's looking good and nice to see things happening...</p>
