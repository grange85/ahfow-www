Dean & Britta will be special guests of comedian Dave Hill at the [UCB Theatre
in NYC this Wednesday (3 May) 9:30 pm

**Update:**  

> Anyway, as if all of that is not enough, my guests this Wednesday will be
Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips from the legendary rock band LUNA. They are
going to come out and play one of their hits and then I will sit them down for
a bit of light chit-chat. Dean & Britta will also share with us a clip from
Tell Me Do You Miss Me, the Luna documentary that made its world premiere at
the Tribeca Film Festival this past Friday, right here in town.
