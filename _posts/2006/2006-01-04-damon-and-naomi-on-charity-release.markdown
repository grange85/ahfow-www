<p>Damon & Naomi are amongst a myriad of very cool artists appearing on a new 5 disc chartity release</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jnanarecords.com/msff.html">Not  Alone</a> will be released in mid January on <a href="http://www.jnanarecords.com/index.html">Jnana records</a> and all proceeds will go to the humanitarian medical aid charity <a href="http://www.msf.org/">Medecins Sans Frontieres</a></p>
<p>The release is incredibly cheap (US$25 for 4 CDs!) and for a very good cause. You can <a href="http://www.jnanarecords.com/shopf.html">pre-order it now</a> and the package should be posted off mid January</p>
