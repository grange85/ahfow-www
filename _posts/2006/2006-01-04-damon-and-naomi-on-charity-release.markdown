Damon & Naomi are amongst a myriad of very cool artists appearing on a new 5
disc chartity release

[Not Alone](https://web.archive.org/web/20060104+/http://www.jnanarecords.com/msff.html) will be released in mid
January on [Jnana records](http://www.jnanarecords.com/index.html) and all
proceeds will go to the humanitarian medical aid charity [Medecins Sans
Frontieres](https://web.archive.org/web/20060104+/http://www.msf.org/)

The release is incredibly cheap (US$25 for 4 CDs!) and for a very good cause.
You can [pre-order it now](https://web.archive.org/web/20060104+/http://www.jnanarecords.com/shopf.html) and the
package should be posted off mid January.
