<p>Damon & Naomi have joined the ugly "social networking" horror that is <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a> - you can <a href="http://www.myspace.com/damonandnaomi">visit their MySpace page</a> and ask to be their friends, listen to music and network (socially) with them and other fans.</p>
