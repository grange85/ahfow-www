<p>The Luna documentary "Tell Me Do You Miss Me" will be screened five times as part of the Tribeca film festival in New York City.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> - My apologies but apparently the dates I posted where unconfirmed - I'll repost as soon as I have a confirmation of screening dates. You could also keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.tribecafilmfestival.org/">festival website</a> for details.</p>
