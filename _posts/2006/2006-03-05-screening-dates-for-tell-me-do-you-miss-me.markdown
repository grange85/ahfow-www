The Luna documentary "Tell Me Do You Miss Me" will be screened five times as
part of the Tribeca film festival in New York City.

**UPDATE:** \- My apologies but apparently the dates I posted where unconfirmed - I'll repost as soon as I have a confirmation of screening dates. You could also keep an eye on the [festival website](https://web.archive.org/web/20060305+/http://www.tribecafilmfestival.org/) for details.
