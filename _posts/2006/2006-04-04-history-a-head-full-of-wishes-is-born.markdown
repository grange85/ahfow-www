A Head Full of Wishes was born out of the frustration of having free web space
and having nothing to fill it with - these were the days before digital
cameras enabled me to fill up the Internet with endless pictures of my family.

In 1994, with the Internet a mere toddler I pinched a bunch of Galaxie 500,
Luna and Damon & Naomi lyrics and sleeve scans, threw together a rough
discography and launched the website.

I'd like to say it was the first Galaxie 500 website but gleet can lay claim
to that honour. But I can probably claim the first Luna and Damon & Naomi
websites so I can feel fairly chuffed with myself. The site chugged along
happily through a few designs and domain changes, gave birth to the still
lively Galaxie 500 Mailing List and got a name check on the Galaxie 500 DVD
(major claim to fame). It now includes Britta Phillips & Dean Wareham and will
cover whatever the rest of the ex-members of Luna decide to get up to.

I still can't believe that I've been tinkering with the website for longer
than I've been married and longer than I've been a father - I'm not bored yet
which probably shows just how tragically sad I am.
