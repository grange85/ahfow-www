The **very** late Galaxie 500 and Luna tribute album finally sees the light of
day. The project kicked off at the tail end of 2004 but due to an insane
amount of procrastination on my part it took a year and a half to actually
reach the rest of the world

The CDR with a cheap b&w; laser printed sleeve can be had for the insanely
cheap price of just $5 a copy including postage to wherever you are.

Feel free to email me to negotiate alternative methods of payment.
