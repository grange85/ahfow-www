The [Luna](https://web.archive.org/web/20060218+/http://www.fuzzywuzzy.com) documentary "Tell Me Do You Miss Me"
will receive its world premiere as part of the 2006 [Tribeca Film
Festival](https://web.archive.org/web/20060218+/http://www.tribecafilmfestival.org/) in New York City. The festival
runs from April 25th to May 7th although no firm date for the premiere has
been set as yet. The four members of Luna will be in attendance as will the
film-maker [Matthew Buzzell](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0125638/). The film
will receive four or five screenings during the festival.

This however does mean that the release of the DVD will be pushed back until
after the festival and wll be released in June - as will the "Best of..." CD.
