<p>So into it's eleventh year the survey goes.When it was launched...</p>
<ul>
<li>Penthouse was so new that it only came in a miserable third (it's been top in every survey since 1998)</li>
<li>You could only choose from two Damon & Naomi albums</li>
<li>Most of us had never heard of Britta Phillips</li>
<li>Luna existed</li>
</ul>
<p>I've had to do a hasty tweak to get the survey working in the new look site so give me a shout if anything goes screwy! Next year I'll jazz it up - four years on and this code is looking a little tired...</p>
<p><strong>Quirks</strong></p>
<p>You can vote for the new Dean & Britta album because it's in the database - but don't because you haven't heard it yet!</p>
<p>There are two "Best of Luna" albums to choose from - I'll probably axe compilations for next time around...</p>
<p>Have fun - and please let me know asap if anything goes wrong!</p>
