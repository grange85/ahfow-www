<p>Producer <a href="http://www.tonyvisconti.com">Tony Visconti</a> has posted a <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.tonyvisconti.com/news/main.htm">little piece on his website</span> (and a couple of pictures) about the first week of work on the new <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">Dean & Britta</a> album (you'll need to scroll halfway down the page).</p>
<blockquote><p>[The] songs are, of course, romantic and heartfelt (and they make my eyes a little dewy -- but it's just a physiological thing, nothing to worry about)</p></blockquote>
<p>There are also a <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/photos.php">few pictures</a> on <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">Dean & Britta's</a> website<br />
