Producer [Tony Visconti](https://web.archive.org/web/20060317+/http://www.tonyvisconti.com) has posted a little
piece on his web site (and a couple of pictures) about the first week of work
on the new [Dean & Britta](https://web.archive.org/web/20060317+/http://www.deanandbritta.com) album (you'll need to
scroll halfway down the page).

There are also a [few pictures](https://web.archive.org/web/20060317+/http://www.deanandbritta.com/photos.php) on
[Dean & Britta's](https://web.archive.org/web/20060317+/http://www.deanandbritta.com) web site
