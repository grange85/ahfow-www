The documentary of Luna's farewell tour Tell Me Do You Miss Me will be getting
shown at at a couple of film festivals outside of the US. Firstly it will
receive three screenings at the [Zweites Internationales Film Festival in
Frankfurt Germany](https://web.archive.org/web/20061022+/http://www.ifff.de) between the 6th and 9th of November.
Film-maker Matthew Buzzell and guitarist Sean Eden will be in attendance on
the 6th.

It will also be shown twice as part of the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival
in Taiwan on the 17th and 22nd of November (sadly no band members or crew will
be in attendance).
