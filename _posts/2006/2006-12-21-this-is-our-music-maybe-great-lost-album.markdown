I'm not sure of David's sources but it seems that This is Our Music may be
featured as the [Great Lost
Album](https://web.archive.org/web/20061221+/http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/gideon_coe/gla.shtml) on Gideon Coe's
BBC 6Music show on the 28th of December.

If it turns out to be true you can [visit the
website](https://web.archive.org/web/20061221+/http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/gideon_coe/gla.shtml) and pick one
of three nominated tracks to get played and discuss the merits of the album.

The item is broadcast between 10 and 11 am GMT ([what time is that where I li
ve?](http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=28&month=12&year=200
6&hour=10&min=0&sec=0&p1=0))
