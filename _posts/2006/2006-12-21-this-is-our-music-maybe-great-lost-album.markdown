<p>I'm not sure of David's sources but it seems that This is Our Music may be featured as the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/gideon_coe/gla.shtml">Great Lost Album</a> on Gideon Coe's BBC 6Music show on the 28th of December.</p>
<p>If it turns out to be true you can <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/gideon_coe/gla.shtml">visit the website</a> and pick one of three nominated tracks to get played and discuss the merits of the album.</p>
<p>The item is broadcaste between 10 and 11 am GMT (<a href="http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=28&month=12&year=2006&hour=10&min=0&sec=0&p1=0">what time is that where I live?</a>)</p>
