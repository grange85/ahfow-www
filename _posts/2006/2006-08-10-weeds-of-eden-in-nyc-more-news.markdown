Just a reminder that Sean Eden's band The Weeds of Eden will be playing at
Pianos in NYC this coming Tuesday (15 August) and the two following Tuesdays.
Also on the bill are [Elk City](https://web.archive.org/web/20060810+/http://www.elkcity.net/) who Sean currently
plays guitar with.

I emailed Sean to get the skinny...  

> I'll bedoing about 5 new songs, maybe more, plus one or both of the tunes
on"Rendezvous" that I sang and some older Weeds of Eden tunes, too.

He also mentioned that he was recording some new material at the moment.

If anyone goes along to any of the gigs feel free to send me reviews and/or
pictures.
