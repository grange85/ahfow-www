<p>Just a reminder that Sean Eden's band The Weeds of Eden will be playing at <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.pianosnyc.com/index0706.html">Pianos</span> in NYC this coming Tuesday (15 August) and the two following Tuesdays. Also on the bill are <a href="http://www.elkcity.net/">Elk City</a> who Sean currently plays guitar with.</p>
<p>I emailed Sean to get the skinny...<br />
<blockquote>I'll bedoing about 5 new songs, maybe more, plus one or both of the tunes on"Rendezvous" that I sang and some older Weeds of Eden tunes, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also mentioned that he was recording some new material at the moment.</p>
<p>If anyone goes along to any of the gigs feel free to send me reviews and/or pictures.</p>
