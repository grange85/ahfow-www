<p>Last weekend Patti Smith played the last ever show at the legendary New York venue CBGBs - so here's my little tribute...</p>
<p>First up here's Galaxie 500 performing Hearing Voices from a show at CBGBs in October 1990.<br/><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/lxxiezxdah">Galaxie 500 - Hearing Voices <em>CBGBs</em></a> (192kb/s mp3 - 5.0MB)</p>
<p>...and here's Luna performing Rock Your Baby from their 2000 New Years Eve show<br/><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/vopq5nc9hf">Luna - Rock Your Baby <em>CBGBs</em></a> (128kb/s mp3 - 3.3MB)</p>
<p>Dean Wareham was quoted in a tribute piece about the venue in the New York Post...<br />
<blockquote>The first band I saw at CBGB's was Richard Helland the Voidoids circa 1980, when I was 16. I was nervous - it was myfirst time in a rock club. I was a little frightened when I went downstairs to pee.</p></blockquote>
