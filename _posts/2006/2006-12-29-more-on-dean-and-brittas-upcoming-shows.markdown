Britta posted to the Galaxie 500 Mailing List with some information about the
upcoming shows.

> We'll be playing with Sean McCaul on vibes & Matt Johnson on drums for the
first Mo Pitkins show on January 9th. Lara Meyerattken will join us on keys
(and various other instruments) along with Matt Johnson at the 2nd Mo Pitkins
on Jan. 23rd & Union Hall on the 25th. Mo Pitkins is a very small sit-down
place, so it will be on the quieter side, half electric & half acoustic
guitar, probably.

A US tour will start in the first week in March.
