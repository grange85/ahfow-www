<p><a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">Dean & Britta's website</a> has a news item stating that <a href="http://www.beggars.com">Beggars Banquet</a> will release the European edition of Best of Luna in October</p>
<blockquote><p>Beggar's Banquet will release a European version of the "Best Of Luna" on 10/9/06. The deluxe 2-CD edition contains one disc of original tracks from the Luna catalogue plus a bonus disc containing cover versions that the band recorded over the years.</p></blockquote>
<p>The astonishingly out-of-date Beggars website has no information and the release hasn't turned up for pre-order on Amazon as yet...but we should be patient as Dean mentioned to me a while back that...</p>
<blockquote><p>the Beggar'sversion will have 17 covers (including "Sweet Child o' Mine" and "Only Women Bleed" and "Jealous Guy", which are not on the iTunes album).</p></blockquote>
<p>As soon as I hear confirmation I'll post it here and pop it into the featured items on the shiny new Amazon (UK) shop</p>
