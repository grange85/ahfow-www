[Dean & Britta's website](https://web.archive.org/web/20060905+/http://www.deanandbritta.com) has a news item
stating that [Beggars Banquet](https://web.archive.org/web/20060905+/http://www.beggars.com) will release the
European edition of Best of Luna in October

> Beggar's Banquet will release a European version of the "Best Of Luna" on
10/9/06. The deluxe 2-CD edition contains one disc of original tracks from the
Luna catalogue plus a bonus disc containing cover versions that the band
recorded over the years.

The astonishingly out-of-date Beggars website has no information and the
release hasn't turned up for pre-order on Amazon as yet...but we should be
patient as Dean mentioned to me a while back that...

> the Beggar'sversion will have 17 covers (including "Sweet Child o' Mine" and
"Only Women Bleed" and "Jealous Guy", which are not on the iTunes album).

As soon as I hear confirmation I'll post it here and pop it into the featured
items on the shiny new Amazon (UK) shop
