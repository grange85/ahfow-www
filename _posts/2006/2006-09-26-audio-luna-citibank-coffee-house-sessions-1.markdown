<p>It's been a while since I posted any new audio so here's a little Luna treat...</p>
<p>This is the first of three tracks Luna recorded around the time of Bewitched for the "Citibank Coffee House Sessions" which were, I guess, a promotional CD-based radio show hosted by Pat DiNizio of the Smithereens. First up is Tiger Lily. I'll post the others over the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jeff for passing this along to me</p>
