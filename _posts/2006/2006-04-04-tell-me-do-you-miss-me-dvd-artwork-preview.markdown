Film director Matthew Buzzell has sent me the front cover of the DVD release
of the Luna documentary Tell Me Do You Miss Me. The sleeve was designed by
[Frank Olinsky](https://web.archive.org/web/20060404+/http://www.frankolinsky.com/index2.html) who previously
designed the sleeves to [most of Luna's CD
packaging](https://web.archive.org/web/20060404+/http://www.frankolinsky.com/luna.html) since Penthouse. The
photograph was taken by [ Galaxie 500 list
member](https://web.archive.org/web/20060404+/http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?article_id=125) Lenore
Holz

The film receives its premiere at the [Tribeca Film
Festival](https://web.archive.org/web/20060404+/http://www.tribecafilmfestival.org/) at the ned of this month and
will be released on DVD by [Rhino](https://web.archive.org/web/20060404+/http://www.rhino.com) in June
