<p>Film director Matthew Buzzell has sent me the front cover of the DVD release of the Luna documentary Tell Me Do You Miss Me. The sleeve was designed by <a href="http://www.frankolinsky.com/index2.html">Frank Olinsky</a> who previously designed the sleeves to <a href="http://www.frankolinsky.com/luna.html">most of Luna's CD packaging</a> since Penthouse. The photograph was taken by <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?article_id=125"> Galaxie 500 list member</a> Lenore Holz</p>
<p>The film receives its premiere at the <a href="http://www.tribecafilmfestival.org/">Tribeca Film Festival</a> at the ned of this month and  will be released on DVD by <a href="http://www.rhino.com">Rhino</a> in June</p>
