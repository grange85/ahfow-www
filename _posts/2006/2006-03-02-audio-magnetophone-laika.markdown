<p>Magnetophone were...</p>
<ul>
<li>Damon Krukowski (guitar/vocals)</li>
<li>Naomi Yang (bass/vocals)</li>
<li>Jon Williams (guitar)</li>
<li>Chris Guttmacher (drums)</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is what the <a href="http://www.grange85.co.uk/galaxie/index.php?article_id=130">out of date Galaxie 500 and related bands FAQ</a> (snappy title huh?) has to say about Magnetophone.<br/> (courtesy of Sean O'Brien)...</p>
<blockquote><p>At the time, Chris was also a member of Cul-de-Sac, a band he left about a year and a half ago He was also the original drummer in Bullet Lavolta. Jon Williams is probably best remembered as the original guitarist in Volcano Suns, but is also a very prolific producer and engineer. If memory serves, Magnetophone played a grand total of about two shows (one of which I saw) here in Boston. No recordings were released, although some do exist (produced by Jon Willaims) I hope this helps a little.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beyond that I know nothing but enjoy this version of Laika, a track that would later turn up on Damon & Naomi's first album More Sad Hits</p>
