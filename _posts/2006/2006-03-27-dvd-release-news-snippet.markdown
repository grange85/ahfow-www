Frank at the ever-excellent [Chromewaves](https://web.archive.org/web/20060327+/http://www.chromewaves.net) has a
[post about the forthcoming DVD](https://web.archive.org/web/20060327+/http://www.chromewaves.net/?itemid=2160)
including the news that one of his pics will be making its way into the DVD
booklet - so head on over there to get a sneak preview and look at the stacks
of other (great) photos.

You might as well add Chromewaves to your blog/rss reader of choice while
you're there because it's rarely anything but a fantastic read
