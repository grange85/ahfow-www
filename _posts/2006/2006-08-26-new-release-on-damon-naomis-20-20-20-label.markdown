October will see the third release on [Damon &
Naomi](http://www.damonandnaomi.com)'s [20|20|20](http://www.20-20-20.com)
label. The album is called [International Sad Hits Volume 1](http://web.archiv
e.org/web/20070108185432/http://www.20-20-20.com:80/catalogue/altaic.html).

> "International Sad Hits, Volume One: Altaic Language Group" is a compilation
featuring four singer-songwriters we very much admire from Turkey, Korea, and
Japan: Fikret Kizilok, Kim Doo Soo, Tomokawa Kazuki, and Mikami Kan. The
package includes biographical information on each artist, and translation of
all lyrics into English. Complete track list, and other information, is
available from 20-20-20.
