<p>Amazon has the tracklisting (and is taking pre-orders) on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FDFPO8/aheadfullofwi-20">The Best of Luna</a> - it will be ereleased on the 20th of June (simultaneously with the DVD).</p>
<p><del>The tracklisting includes a title that I don't recognise which may be to suck the fans into buying a load of tracks they already have (or a nice bonus becasue we'd probably buy it anyway).</del></p>
<p><b>update:</b> It seems the mysterious track is in fact a mistake and instead of "Hard Life" should in fact read "Sideshow by the Seashore.</p>
<p>More details and packaging as soon as I find out anything</p>
