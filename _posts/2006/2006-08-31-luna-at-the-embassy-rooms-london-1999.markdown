<p>Hot - really hot.</p>
<p>I arrived just in time to catch support act Scott4 who were OK - I sort ofliked when they drifted off into Krautrock-ish grooves, once the singer hadstopped singing the songs tended to get better - not that he was bad I justpreferred them when he was doing something else (and there were plenty ofinstruments he could diddle about with).</p>
<p>Luna arrived on stage and launched into Pup Tent and proceeded to play arather wonderful little greatest hits package, I have to agree with Ian'sobservation about the Pup Tent stuff really working well live, they openedwith a cracking "Pup Tent" and did a very good "IHOP" later on. Oh lots ofother stuff "Time To Quit", "Chinatown", "Tiger Lily", "SuperfreakyMemories", "Dear Diary", "23 Minutes...".</p>
<p>They finished with a truly wonderful take of "Friendly Advice" and left thestage to rapturous applause.</p>
<p>Two years between Luna shows is way too long, but this was a good enough showthat I managed to forgive them. I left a very happy (and extremely sweaty -it was hot!) man.</p>
<p>I managed to grab a few words (of the "you were great" kind) with Dean andJustin after the show - which was very enjoyable for me and probably a bitscary for them (fat, scruffy, unshaven and dripping with sweat I wouldn'tlike to have met myself!).</p>
<p>And no Justin isn't nearly as tall as I thought he was, and Dean is cute.</p>
<p>OK that'll do - I need a shower.</p>
