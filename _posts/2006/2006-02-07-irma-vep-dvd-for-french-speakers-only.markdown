The excellent [DVD Times](http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk) has a very in depth
review of [Olivier Assayas's Irma
Vep](http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=60265)
([IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116650/maindetails)). Unfortunatley this
release comes without English subtitles but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy
hearing Luna's Bonnie and Clyde on the soundtrack.

The film was directed by Olivier Assayas and stars Maggie Cheung who also
collaborated on 2004's [Clean](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388838/) which had
even more Luna related music on the soundtrack (and I've just noticed the
soundtrack album is missing from the discography - I'll fix this tonight).
