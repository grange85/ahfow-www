<p>The excellent <a href="http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk">DVD Times</a> has a very in depth review of <a href="http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=60265">Olivier Assayas's Irma Vep</a> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116650/maindetails">IMDB</a>). Unfortunatley this release comes without English subtitles but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy hearing Luna's Bonnie and Clyde on the soundtrack.</p>
<p>The film was directed by Olivier Assayas and stars Maggie Cheung who also collaborated on 2004's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388838/">Clean</a> which had even more Luna related music on the soundtrack (and I've just noticed the soundtrack album is missing from the discography - I'll fix this tonight).</p>
