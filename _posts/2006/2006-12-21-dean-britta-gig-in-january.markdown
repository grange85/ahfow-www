[Sonic Boom](https://web.archive.org/web/20061221+/http://www.sonic-boom.info)'s website mentions that he is doing a
gig with Dean & Britta at Mo Pitkin's in NYC on January 9th. No mention as yet
on [Dean & Britta's website](https://web.archive.org/web/20061221+/http://deanandbritta.com/) or the Mo Pitkin's
site.

**Update:** I just noticed this date is mentioned on Dean & Britta's MySpace page as well as another date at the same venue on 23 January.
