<p>Entertainment weekly have a <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,1205749_21_0_,00.html">nice little interview with Dean Wareham</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>How much do you miss being in Luna?</b><br/>I don't miss it at all. Maybe I'll come to miss it at some point, but right now, it's kind of liberating. It's nice not to be responsible for a bunch of people making a living.</p></blockquote>
