<p>The very excellent <a href="http://www.wildcarnation.com">Wild Carnation</a> and Glenn Mercer (formerly of The Feelies) are playing tonight (Wednesday September 9th) at <a href="http://www.maxwellsnj.com/">Maxwells</a> in Hoboken, NJ - at $8 a ticket you'd be silly to miss it if you're in the area - Doors 8:30</p>
<p>If you look hard enough you can probably find a Luna connection!</p>
