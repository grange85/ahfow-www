<p>The Rhino website now has pages about the forthcoming CD Best of Luna and their DVD release of the Matthew Buzzell film Tell Me Do You Miss Me - there's also a sneak preview of one of the bonus features from the DVD - a complete Luna performance of Bewitched</p>
<p>The Rhino store is also selling both items but they are both considerably cheaper at Amazon.com. In fact the Best of CD has dropped in price and is now selling for $12.97 so if you ordered at the higher price you may want to cancel and re-order!</p>
