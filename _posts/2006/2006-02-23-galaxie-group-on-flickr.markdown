<p>After the horrors of MySpace it's nice to be able to write a news item about a "community" website that has got things so right</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/92643213@N00/">Galaxie group</a> recently set up on the very wonderful <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> - the group is for<br />
<blockquote>any excuse to name a photo after a Galaxie 500 song, or for that matter Luna and similar/related music</p></blockquote>
<p>At last somewhere to post pictures of Tugboats, Penthouses and Decomposing Trees...</p>
