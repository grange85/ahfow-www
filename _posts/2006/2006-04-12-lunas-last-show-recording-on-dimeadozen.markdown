<p>A previously uncirculated recording of Luna's last show at the Bowery Ballroom in February 2005 is currently being seeded on the Dimeadozen bittorrent tracker</p>
<blockquote><p>This show is a great document of their last gasp. Dean frequently gets choked up during the set, often mid-song. The only major fault is Britta's vocals are a bit too high at times. The track splits were as I received them and are not medleys.</p>
