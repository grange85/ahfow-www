<p>Frank at (the very wonderful) <a href="http://www.chromewaves.net/">Chromewaves</a> has a <a href="http://www.chromewaves.net/?itemid=2438">post about Dean & Britta</a> and mentions that you can hear 30 second clips of the whole of the upcoming album Back Numbers at the <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.zoerecords.net/index.php?id=album.php&catalog_id=6925">Zoe Records website</span></p>
<p>I haven't listened because I'm not sure I want 30 second tasters but if that's your cup of tea head on over.</p>
<p>He also mentions that the release date for the album has been pushed back a month to February 27th.</p>
