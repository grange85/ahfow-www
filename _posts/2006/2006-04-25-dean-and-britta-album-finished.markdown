<p>There's a short news item on <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com">Dean & Britta's website</a> announcing that the next album is "finished". They have recorded 15 songs and will cut these down to 11 for an album release.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sonic-boom.info/">Sonic Boom</a> recorded on a number of songs and can be seen squatting on the floor of Dean & Britta's "home studio" in a <a href="http://www.deanandbritta.com/av.php">couple of short videos</a> also on Dean & Britta's website<br />
<blockquote>... On that note - I'm in town to record some stuff on the new Dean Wareham & Britta Phillips l.p. that they are making with Tony Visconti in New York. The initial recordings promise another stunningly beautiful record and the vibe is very blissfully mellow in a kinda valium sorta way. The sessions include a song co-written by me with D & B over the last two years. We'll also no doubt be working on the lp we've been collaborating on as a joint project since '05.<br/><a href="http://www.sonic-boom.info/news.php">Sonic Boom</a></p></blockquote>
