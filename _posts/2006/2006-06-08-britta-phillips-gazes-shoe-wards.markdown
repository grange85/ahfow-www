The always very excellent
[Chromewaves](https://web.archive.org/web/20060608+/http://www.chromewaves.net/index.php?itemid=2237) reports that
Britta Phillips will be contributing a track to the second volume of [Club
AC30](https://web.archive.org/web/20060608+/http://www.clubac30.com/)'s series of albums featuring bright young
things covering the songs of shoegazings finest. Britta contributes a cover of
Spectrum's "How You Satisfy Me"

Spectrum was the project that Sonic Boom/Pete Kember formed after the split of
Spiritualized. Pete Kember has worked with both Dean & Britta and Luna over
the years and Spectrum, like Luna, released a cover version of Beat
Happening's Indian Summer.

Keep and eye on [Club AC30's web page](https://web.archive.org/web/20060608+/http://www.clubac30.com) and [Myspace
page](https://web.archive.org/web/20060608+/http://www.myspace.com/clubac30) for more details.
