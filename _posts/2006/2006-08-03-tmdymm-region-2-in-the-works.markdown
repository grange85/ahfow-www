<p>OK I have to admit that this is barely news but it's all I have to offer for now! The Region 2 release of Matthew Buzzell's Luna documentary &quot;Tell Me Do You Miss Me&quot; is &quot;in the works&quot; - as soon as I have any news on release dates I'll post here.</p>
<p>In the meantime Matthew has started working on his next project which is a comedy &quot;mockumentary&quot; entitled &quot;Sunny and Share Loves You&quot; (a few) more details at <a href="http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=19249">Empire Movie News</a></p>
<p><ins datetime="20060804">update: I'm reliably informed (see comments!) that the supporting cast for "Sunny and Share" includes a certain Sean Eden</ins></p>
