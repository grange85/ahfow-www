OK I have to admit that this is barely news but it's all I have to offer for
now! The Region 2 release of Matthew Buzzell's Luna documentary "Tell Me Do
You Miss Me" is "in the works" - as soon as I have any news on release dates
I'll post here.

In the meantime Matthew has started working on his next project which is a
comedy "mockumentary" entitled "Sunny and Share Loves You" (a few) more
details at [Empire Movie
News](https://web.archive.org/web/20060803+/http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=19249)

update: I'm reliably informed (see comments!) that the supporting cast for
"Sunny and Share" includes a certain Sean Eden
