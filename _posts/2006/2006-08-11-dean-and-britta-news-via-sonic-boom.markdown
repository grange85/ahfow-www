[Sonic Boom](https://web.archive.org/web/20060811+/http://www.sonic-boom.info/news.php) has just updated his website
and inlcuded this news snippet...

> Today been finalising a mix of a tune from the new DeanandBritta E.P. that
Rounder are putting out soonish. I did the cover again too, but not the mixes
of the other tracks this time, just a pretty track "When I lay my burden down"
that Dean gleaned from somewhere special & sent for the sonic mangle...
