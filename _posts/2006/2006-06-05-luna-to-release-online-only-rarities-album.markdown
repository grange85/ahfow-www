<p>An article in today's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/05/technology/05luna.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">New York Times</a> reports that Luna will be selling an "album" of rarities through Rhino/Warner, Lunafied will be ONLY available online.</p>
<blockquote><p>The band initially suggested putting out a two-disc set, with one disc devoted to hits and the other devoted to covers, according to frontman Dean Wareham, who now performs with his wife in the duo Dean & Britta. "But they sent it upstairs to the people who analyze how they're going to make money," he said. And because online consumers tend to buy music by the song, collectors buy only the tracks they do not already own.</p>
<p>"Only a small core of people have heard everything," Mr. Wareham said.</p>
