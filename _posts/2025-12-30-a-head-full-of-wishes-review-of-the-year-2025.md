After [2024 being fairly quiet]() on the AHFoW front, 2026 turned out fuller, particularly for Dean, and Britta, but especially for me! But, lets start with some stats:

 - AHFoW
   - 168 posts, 104 of them about [my record collection]().
   - I also launched a Substack in April that has a weekly _newsletter_, and a weekly bonus post of new(ish) content so another 68 posts there!
   - Also around 300 posts on Instgram and/or Facebook and/or BlueSky

 - Shows
   - Dean Wareham - 47
   - Dean & Britta - 7
   - Dean Wareham and Sea Power - 2
   - Luna - 8
   - _there's always a chance that some might have slipped through the net_

 - Releases
   - 28th March - Dean Wareham - That's The Price of Loving Me 
   - 12th April - Dean & Britta - A Gift / Homeward Bound
   - 8th August - Galaxie 500 - CBGB 13th December 1988
