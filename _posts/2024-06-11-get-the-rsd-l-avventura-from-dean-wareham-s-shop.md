Dean Wareham's online shop now has some copies of the deluxe L'Avventura double LP that was released for Record Store Day a couple of months back.

Head over to Dean's website and [grab yourself a copy](https://deanwareham.com/product/992679) before it's too late. He did also have some copies of the Back Numbers reissue but looks like you might already be too late for that.
