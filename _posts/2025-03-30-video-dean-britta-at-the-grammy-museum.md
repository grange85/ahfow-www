Dean and Britta recently took part in an event at The Grammy Museum called "Fifty Years in Sixty Minutes: An Evening with the Bob Dylan Center" where they took part in a post-film Q&A and performed some of their Dylan covers. 

A couple of clips have turned up on YouTube of {% ahfowtrack "I'll Keep It With Mine" %} and {% ahfowtrack "Most of the Time" %} (there are a couple of other Dylan songs in their repertoire but not sure if they played more than this?)
