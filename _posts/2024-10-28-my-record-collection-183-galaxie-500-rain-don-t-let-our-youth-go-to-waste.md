Caff Records was a label set up by Saint Etienne's Bob Stanley and it released this beauty in 1990. It has a cover of The Beatles' Rain on side _A_, and of Jonathan Richman's Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste on side B. Both recorded at CBGB's on 13th May 1989.

Oddly, when released on CD, as part of Uncollected, and when made available to download these two songs were sequenced as one almost nine minute track - this meant, if you were so inclined, you could buy this for 79&cent; on iTunes, which struck me as a spectacular bargain. It also means that the only way you get to hear the tracks as originally released (with a fade-out of _Rain_, and a fade-in to _... Youth..._) is if you have a copy of the single. 

The tracks were also released on a [very limited cassette](https://www.discogs.com/release/10148995-Galaxie-500-Rain-Dont-Let-Our-Youth-Go-To-Waste), I don't have and have never heard that but suspect it was sequenced as a single track because there'd be no reason to do the fades if you didn't have to fit in on a 7" single.

_Obviously I'm pretty much the only person who considers Galaxie 500 fade-ins and outs as collectable!_

The single came with an insert with the following information:

<blockquote>

This is another single that came in the [care package of 7" singles](/2014/12/10/happy-20th-birthday-head-full-wishes-3/) that Damon and Naomi sent me in 2004:
