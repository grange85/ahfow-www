Since this is post 300 in the series I thought it might be good to pull out a particularly special item from my collection, previous milestones have just come randomly from the backlog but today I've picked out the Galaxie 500 box set from 1996...

... although, _special_ is a bit subjective since I've already had a post about one copy of the Galaxie 500 box set - so "how and why is this special?" I hear you ask. Well, this might be a long story, and one that has already been touched on in a number of earlier posts.

In early 1980 Sinclair launched the ZX80 - a computer for less than Â£100. I talked my dad into buying me one. It was a frustrating machine to use but it planted the seed. I worked y way through a number of computers (ZX81, TRS80, C64, Amiga A500) and slowly got the hang of things, I was never a computer whizz, but I knew what I was doing and was patient and methodical.

Things changed in the early-90s with two significant developments:

 - The Commodore Amiga A1200
 - Demon Internet for a tenner a month
