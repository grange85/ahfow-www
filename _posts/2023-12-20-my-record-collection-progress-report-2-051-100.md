... plus ...
- three extra posts, [the introduction to the series](/2023/01/18/my-record-collection-introduction/), [progress report #1](/2023/07/11/my-record-collection-progress-report-1-000-050/), and the ['Have you been paying attention?' quiz](/2023/12/08/my-record-collection-quiz-1/) (which you can still take (and win some fab goodies).

 - Total number of entries in the my record collection spreadsheet: 364 (up 24 since progress report 1 - mostly due to spreadsheet wrangling and finding things that were missed)
 - Number posted: 100 (27.5%)
