This is my second copy of the double CD edition of 13 Most Beautiful but since [the first](/2024/01/08/my-record-collection-099-dean-britta-13-most-beautiful-2xcd/) was still in its shrink wrap this is the one I'll actually get to listen to! 

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/dean-and-britta-13-most-beautiful-2cd-open.jpg" "Dean & Britta - 13 Most Beautiful" %}

Because this is, in theory at least, a soundtrack album it should be about the film it soundtracks, although that seems less the case with this one since the whole film/presentation is episodic, and each _episode_ requires a track the exact length of the episode, and each episode is of a fairly consistent length - as long as a 100ft roll of 16mm film.

I was a projectionist for about 18 months in the late 80s (so long ago) and so I know that...

One foot of 16 mm film is 40 frames  
therefore...  
100 feet is 4000 frames, shot at 25 frames per second that equal 160 seconds, so, each film is 2 minutes and 40 seconds long.

Warhol projected these slower to extend to around 4 minutes - which I suspect is projecting at 16 frames per second - which works out at 250 seconds or 4 minutes and 10 seconds.

So, in theory each of the tracks on 13 Most Beautiful ought to be that long, most are - this is what my DVD suggests:

 - 01, Ann: 04:30 /  _04:25 on disc 1 of the CD_
 - 02, Paul: 04:38 /  _04:58_
 - 03, Edie: 04:18 /  _04:47_
 - 04, Billy: 04:43 /  _05:06_
 - 05, Susan: 04:20 /  _04:37_
 - 06, Dennis: 04:31 /  _04:43_
 - 07, Mary: 04:01 /  _04:02_
 - 08, Nico: 04:38 /  _04:51_
 - 09, Freddy: 05:12 /  _05:11_
 - 10, Richard: 04:34 /  _06:24_
 - 11, Ingrid: 04:33 /  _03:52_
 - 12, Lou: 04:43 /  _03:09_
 - 13, Jane: 04:34 /  _04:29_

Which, with a bit of leader I guess makes sense, except chapter 9, Freddy Herko, who for some reason over-runs!? The versions on this CD are mostly remixes, and as you can see often run a different length and the CD version of _Not a Young Man Anymore_ isn't long enough for the film!

It's odd but I often don't instantly think of this as a Dean & Britta album here are some reasons why:

 - it has been released in different versions with different tracks/mixes/running order
 - it is heavier on instrumental tracks than their _real albums_
 - it contains songs/tracks that started life elsewhere
 - its first release was a DVD

Of course it _is_ a Dean & Britta album... or, is it?!

Track 7 on disc 1 is described as being _Produced, **performed** and mixed by Anthony LaMarca_ - performed?? It's certainly _sung_ by Dean, but _performed_ by Anthony?? Does this make it a _Various Artists_ release??

_Apologies for the random and probably incomprehensible ramblings of this post!_
