Just because I just came across a sweet clip of Dean playing _My Rifle, My Pony, and Me_ live from home back in 2018 I thought I'd revive the [Originals](/category/originals/) series...

The tune was [originally used](https://youtu.be/gp0vMW016gg) in the great film [Red River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_(1948_film)) in 1948 - the film was directed by Howard Hawks and starred John Wayne and Walter Brennan - it was then revived for the even better 1959 western [Rio Bravo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Bravo_(film)) - this film was also directed by Howard Hawks and it too starred John Wayne and Walter Brennan! But, since it also starred two singers, Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson, it was given some words for them to sing.

_... as a bonus that video also has Ricky singing Cindy from the film_.

Dean recorded _My Rifle, My Pony and Me_ for the [Dean Wareham vs Cheval Sombre](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/database/dean-wareham/releases/dean-wareham-vs-cheval-sombre/) album of "cowboy tunes" but here he is playing it for Facebook back in October 2018:
