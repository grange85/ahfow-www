A couple of tribute compilations today the first an LP tribute _to_ Tom Rapp which has already put in an appearance in CD form, and then a CD tribute to Neil Young with a contribution from Tom, with vocals by Naomi and produced by Damon.

I don't suppose I have too much to add about For The Dead in Space - I bought the LP on Discogs as a collection filler for two quid. The seller described it thus:

<blockquote>
Sleeve is NM - very slight corner-wear. Vinyl has been played a handful of times, mostly to see if I get get it to play better after cleaning - I couldn't - it's a poor pressing. S1 is OK, though there's some heavy crackle in places. S2 is hard work with a lot of crackle, and some clicks, some heavy. With insert, but the ink from this has spoilt label S2. Not a keeper - priced to satisfy curiosity. 
</blockquote>

I suspect, since I have it on CD, I didn't bother playing it to confirm the issues... but I'm playing it now. Side one is indeed quite crackly. And yes, side two is worse... but maybe the content means it doesn't matter? Actually... it's just got worse so yes, it does matter. I perservered and made it all the way through the cracks and pops... but back into it's sleeve now, likely to never see the light of day again. Still... only two quid!!

Townies do a cover of Dear Miss Morse - I had been in touch with Michael from the band from the earliest days of the Internet having connected over a mutual love of Miracle Legion. In 2010 Michael was in the UK and I met him after work in White City and gave him a tour of BBC Television Centre (where I was working at the time), around then there was a Tardis out the front of TVC and I showed it to Michael... I think he may have been a bit bemused by a time-travelling police box.

The second comp is a two CD tribute to Neil Young and Tom Rapp does a fairly straight cover of After The Goldrush
