While the US got a single disc Best of Luna and Lunafied as a download, the bands UK label, Beggars Banquet gave us on this side of the pond a lovely two disc edition with a whole disc of _Lunafied_ cover versions.

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/best-of-luna-uk-cd-playing.jpg" "Best of Luna (UK)" %}

The discs were named "Best of Luna" and "Lunafied" although this led to the awkwardness of having a "Best of Luna" disc without any cover versions - this could almost be fixed by the fact that the whole package was called "Best of Luna" but then... should a "Best of Luna" package have "Only Women Bleed" or "In The FLesh"?

When I covered the US "Best of Luna" I created a table stating the album origins of each of the tracks... so, lets revisit and compare:

| Best of Luna           | US | UK 
|------------------------|----|----
| Lunapark               |3   |2
| Bewitched              |4   |4
| Penthouse              |5   |5
| Pup Tent               |2   |2
| The Days of Our Nights |1   |2
| Romantica              |0   |2
| Rendezvous             |1   |0 
| non album track        |0   |1

So once again The Best of Luna is heavy on their first three albums which makes up almost two thirds of the album. And Rendezvous doesn't get a look in! The album that Dean put at number 2 when he [ranked Luna's studio albums](https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2016/05/12/dean-wareham-ranks-lunas-studio-albums/) back in 2016!

I tried to think of the 18 songs I'd put on **my** Best of Luna but I'm damned if I could, so I asked last.fm to tell me which Luna songs had been scrobbled the most:

- 23 Minutes in Brussels
- Sideshow By The Seashore
- Lost In Space
- Malibu Love Nest
- Chinatown
- California (All the Way)
- Tiger Lily
- Speedbumps
- Moon Palace
- Broken Chair
- Bewitched
- Friendly Advice
- Double Feature
- Rhythm King
- This Time Around
- Slide
- Anesthesia
- Kalamazoo

So, Penthouse - 8; Bewitched - 5; Rendezvous - 3; Lunapark - 2

Nice to see Rendezvous getting a look in but almost the whole of Penthouse! And I removed the couple of cover versions and Bonnie and Clyde was one of them! Tragically you have to go a long way down the list to find anything from Pup Tent!

The liner notes for Best of Luna had short little pen portraits of each song on the album... although they're often only superficially about the song... here are a couple of my favourites.

Since it's almost Christmas...

<blockquote>
Elektra asked us to record a Christmas single in 1992. Justin had written a little instrumental that he thought might work all we had to do was add sleigh bells and give it a Christmas-y title. This was our first recording session as a quartet, Sean having joined the band about a month earlier. These sessions took place at Mixolydian Studios in Boonton, New Jersey, with Feelies' engineer Don Sternecker recording and mixing. Over the course of two days we recorded "Indian Summer", "Ride Into the Sun", "That's What You Always Say" and "Egg Nog". Sean's playing was stellar, and for the first time Luna felt like a band.

<blockquote>
On Saturday afternoons, Channel 55 used to show re-runs of Columbo. One of my favorite episodes, Étude in Black, stars John Cassavetes as a maestro who murders his pianist girlfriend. He carefully stages the murder so it will look like a suicide, turning on the gas, and putting her head in the oven. Columbo doesn't buy it. "Murder is bad," he says, "but suicide is sad. Why would a girl like that put her head in the oven?"
</blockquote>
<p class="caption">Bobby Peru (Dean Wareham - Best of Luna sleeve notes)</p>

So the film that _Bobby Peru_ is from doesn't get mentioned.

<blockquote>
Sean first played us this riff during the Pup Tent sessions, but decided he wasn't ready to record it. He brought it back to us for The Days of Our Nights album. Britney Spears released a song called "Dear Diary" in 2000, just months after we did. It's all about a boy that she saw on the street, who she thinks may have been smiling at her, and she can't get him out of her mind, and she wonders if they could be more than just friends. Which is cool. because my lyrics are about spying a cute girl on the train, and she's reading silly magazines and singing a song, and I can't stop thinking about her.

I found that quite interesting because Dean's version seems to be like one of Adrian Tomine's most famous New Yorker covers... also on the front cover of his New York Drawings, here's my copy:

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/substack/adrian-tomine-new-york-drawings.jpg" "Adrian Tomine - New York Drawings" %}

I love Adrian Tomine's art, and did before it turned up on a Luna album... I can't really remember how I learnt about him - although possibly through someone on the Galaxie 500 Mailing List.

Lunafied also gets little one-sentence sketches...

 - Outdoor Miner - _We recorded this for a 7" single on a Spanish label, "Why don't you choose the artwork?" I told them. "I'm sure it'll be fine". They chose a gruesome photograph of a dead cat with a metal stake driven through its eye._
 - Only Women Bleed - _... Justin refused to play on this ballad, so we waited till he was out of the band - it was recorded during the making of Romantica._
 - Bonnie and  Clyde - _We couldn't decide if "Bonnie and Clyde" worked better fast or slow, so we did it both ways._
