**Update 9th December 2025**
Some more of the unique Galaxie 500 test pressings are now for sale at a fixed price on Damon & Naomi's [20\|20\|20 website](https://www.20-20-20.com/testpressings). The test pressings are, like all in the series, are being sold in beautiful hand-made sleeves:

<blockquote>
<p>The sleeves feature images from Naomi’s archive of sketches and mechanicals used in creating the final commercial cover art for each Galaxie 500 release - in the same way that a test pressing is needed to make a final album, these sketches and mechanicals were used to create the final artwork for the original covers. </p>
<p>These images are then collaged onto an piece of Pantone color paper from the late 80’s, also from Naomi’s archive. These color papers were crucial to the pre-digital design work that Naomi employed on all the original Galaxie 500 releases. Each test pressing uses a different Pantone color, there are no two the same.</p>

The sleeves feature images from Naomi’s archive of sketches and mechanicals used to create the commercial cover art for each corresponding Galaxie 500 release. In the same way that a test pressing is needed to make a final LP, these sketches and mechanicals were used to create the final artwork for the original release. </p>
