After a crazy run of Magic Hour releases in the first few months of this series this is their first appearance in over six months. This is a black vinyl copy of the last Magic Hour single. 

{% ahfowimage "https://media.fullofwishes.co.uk/00-misc/my-record-collection/magic-hour-i-had-a-thought-black-vinyl.jpg" "Magic Hour - I Had a Thought / America" %}

The A side is I Had a Thought and is lifted from their second album _Will They Turn You On or Will They Turn on You_, the B side is a cover of America from Peruvian rock band Traffic Sound's third album, _Tibet's Suzettes_ from 1970.

The picture on the sleeve is of indigenous American [Mountain Chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Chief) listening to a recording on a wax cylinder being played by enthnologist [Frances Densemore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Densmore) in 1916. A different pic from the same session appeared on the sleeve of the Folkways album [Healing Songs of the American Indians](https://folkways.si.edu/healing-songs-of-the-american-indians/music/album/smithsonian).

 - I bought this on eBay... I know that since I left the handwritten note from the seller in the sleeve. No clues as to what I paid but I suspect not much.
