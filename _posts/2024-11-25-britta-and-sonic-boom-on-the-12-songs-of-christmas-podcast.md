Britta and Pete Kember (aka Sonic Boom) are the guests of Alex Rawls on the [12 Songs of Christmas podcast](https://www.twelvesongsofchristmas.com/) talking about [A Peace of Us](/database/dean-and-britta/releases/a-peace-of-us/).

<blockquote>
As Britta Phillips and Sonic Boom - Pete Kember - explain  [...] the album is an expression of their relationship, and something they have been working on in bits and pieces since 2007 when Dean & Britta recorded a 45 with "Old Toy Trains" and "He's Coming Home." Kember talks about how he suggests covers, and how that too is part of their relationship.
