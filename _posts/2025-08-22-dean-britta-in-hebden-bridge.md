And so to the second (of six) shows in a row sees Dean & Britta playing as a duo once again in the lovely Trades Hall in Hebden Bridge.

I arrived at opening time and bumped into Joe in the entrance, having already managed to ignore him while walking around the town earlier in the day. The room tonight has chairs in rows half way to the back and we took up position in the front row to the left of the stage.

Deary came on stage as a four piece and played a lovely 40 minute set of dreamy guitar wash which was a lovely start.

Between sets I went to the back to see if standing was a better option, but by now the room was quite full so I decided the front row seats were a better option. Dean and Britta were at the merch table so I popped over to say "hi" and to drop off a few copuies of [On Fire \| 30]() for them to give away (or sell) - since I haven't managed to shift them!

I returned to my seat and at precisely 9pm Dean & Britta took up position. The stage was, of course, considerably sparser than the previous night - a stool each for Dean and Britta, and a stool for Britta's box of electronic tricks (and Sonic Boom drones).

They opened with a cover of The Clash's _I'm So Bored With The USA_ and then played through a set pulling from all phases of Dean's career.

Setlist:
 - I'm So Bored With The USA
 - The Cloud is Coming
 - Night Nurse
 - Love is Colder Than Death
 - I'll Keep it With Mine
 - Mystery Guest
 - Snowstorm

All delivered beautifully and with charming between songs banter.

They then briefly left the stage and returned for an encore for which they had nothing prepared so took requests - they had picked Strange, before someone then shouted for Bonnie & Clyde, and after a little discussion decided to give it a go "maybe a verse and a chorus" - and a fine effort was made before it fell apart amongst forgotten lyrics. And then they played Strange - a very different beast from the previous night's performance of the song.

All over and we said our goodbyes to the band and the friends we'd met or made during the evening and headed back to our digs.

This morning we're heading to the Krankenhaus Festival in Cumbria for day three - another Dean and Sea Power set - this evening.
